Male: 100%, Male, aol launched lifestream, a social aggregator and publisher, as part of their aim platform at techcrunch50 last fall. since then it has gained nearly 2 million users, say aol. based on that success aol is now launching lifestream as a standalone product at lifestream.aol.com. like friendfeed, lifestream aggregates a number of third party social networks – facebook, twitter, myspace, foursquare, delicious, digg, flickr, youtube, etc., so if you follow a lifestream user you’ll see all of the content that user publishes on those networks, and lifestream automatically pulls in content from people you already follow on those various social networks, so you don’t have to create yet another new friend list. lifestream isn’t yet integrated with google buzz, but aol says it may be coming soon. users can filter out content from specific networks if they like, on a per user or broad basis. a way to think about this – “noise cancellation for social networks.” lifestream also lets users publish back to social networks. status updates posted to lifestream can be posted back to facebook, myspace and/or twitter. lifestream also optionally notes your location in your status updates via gps on mobile devices, or you can manually add it instead.
Male: 100%, Male, as part of the federal trade commission’s ongoing hearings into the future of journalism, google’s chief economist, hal varian, gave a presentation on newspapers and their financial problems that is well worth taking some time to read (or view). the slide deck is embedded below, and martin langeveld has a great overview at the nieman journalism lab that also includes a transcript of varian’s presentation. the google economist (who also wrote a blog post) does a pretty thorough job of explaining the untenable position that newspapers currently find themselves in, and how it isn’t the internet’s fault (in other words, it isn’t google’s fault). the biggest problem, varian says, is that the news part of what newspapers do — the hard reporting and crime and investigative stuff that everyone thinks of when they say the word “journalism” — has traditionally been subsidized by all the rest of what newspapers do, such as the automotive section, the travel section, the lifestyle features and so on (which almost no one thinks of when they say the word “journalism”). those other parts of the paper, unfortunately, are being targeted by subject-specific web sites and services, leaving the news part of the operation unprotected. as he put it: traditionally, the ad revenue from these special sections has been used to cross-subsidize the core news production. nowadays internet users go directly to websites like edmunds, orbitz, epicurious, and amazon to look for products and services in specialized areas. not surprisingly, advertisers follow those eyeballs, which makes the traditional cross-subsidization model that newspapers have used far more difficult. although it’s admittedly a bit presumptuous to expect varian to come up with solutions to this problem, he’s a little light on the solutions front, mentioning google’s “fastflip” experiment as one possible answer, as well as living stories and a couple of other google projects. but one part of his presentation really hit home with me, and that was when he talked about the amount of time people spend with the news online. on average, he said, they spend about 70 seconds a day. varian says part of the reason for that is people reading online at work, where they have less time to spend with the news.
Male: 100%, Female, tomorrow, the special envoy for malaria at the united nations will be announcing a special social media envoy group that will use the power of social media over the next year to raise awareness for malaria control in african countries. the special envoy is made up of well-known figures from both the social web and broadcast media, including mashable’s own pete cashmore. those that have joined the group have pledged to take one “social” action — such as a tweet or a facebook (facebook) post — every month for the next year starting from world malaria day on april 25, which last year saw malaria no more also use twitter for the cause. the hope is that the tweets, posts and other social actions will inspire and motivate social media audiences in support of malaria control. the un’s goal is to provide all endemic african countries with malaria control interventions by the end of 2010, working towards the aim of near-zero deaths from malaria by 2015. we’re very happy to see the un enlist the power of social media in the fight against malaria. the disease kills one million people each year with over 90% of the world’s malaria deaths occurring in sub-saharan africa. universal bed net coverage is the un’s chosen prevention tool to fight the diseases; it has delivered over 192 million insecticidal mosquito nets since 2007, covering nearly 400 million people. however, there is more money to be raised and more work to be done. we hope that the social media envoy will go even farther than their commitment to one social action per month, because malaria is a battle where every little bit helps.
Male: 97%, Female, we recently reported child-actor corey haim had obtained a large quantity of prescription drugs just prior to his death earlier this week.despite early reports suggesting haim died of an enlarged heart, the coroner's office has stated the final cause of death won't be available for another six weeks when toxicology reports are completed. they have also begun investigating how haim was able to get access to such powerful medications, including oxycontin, vicodin and valium.according to the nyt, one of the prescriptions used to obtain these drugs was a forgery and investigators are looking into a larger issue with drug rings stealing legitimate script pads from doctors and forging prescriptions which are then sold illegally. but it goes even further than that. here's what california attorney general jerry brown had to say: “they get prescription drug pads, get illegal drugs, then sell them on the street. you have doctors doing wrong, people pretending to be doctors, and all the criminal intermediaries making the process work.”initial police reports into haim's death stated no illegal or illicit drugs were found in his possession however, as we've learned with high profile cases like heath ledger, anna nicole smith, michael jackson, and brittany murphy, prescription drugs used improperly can have just as deadly consequences.haim's agent, who also represents his long-time friend corey feldman, mark heaslip said corey was making great strides to wean himself off of drugs, which may have been as many as 50 pills a day. he also said the actor had just begun work with an addiction specialist. in the days leading up to corey's death he had complained of having trouble breathing and had a fever between 99 and 101. his mother had thought he was fighting off a cold or flu, but as it turns out these may have been symptoms of his enlargdheart.
Male: 100%, Male, it's a topic that would probably make the average individual's eyes glaze over, but will have a profound impact on the economy - for better or worse. the topic - financial regulation reform. with senate banking chairman sen. chris dodd, d-conn., setting his proposal out for the public, the take away on the reporting from two of the country's major newspapers - the new york times and wall street journal can give readers a view where their reporters' loyalties lie. on cnbc's march 15 "squawk box," co-host joe kernen raised this point - the journal with its more pro-wall street point of view and the times with a liberal pro-democratic party one. "you - i like the way you highlighted the journal's take, ‘ohh, this thing is ahh, much worse,' but the new york times - ‘consensus-building,'" kernen said. "but the new york times is talking about consensus-building within the democratic party, i think, right? i mean, normally that's who they're speaking to, isn't it?" read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/jeff-poor/2010/03/15/study-bias-two-takes-financial-regs-journal-vs-ny-times-pointed-out-cnbc-#ixzz0iplpdgzg 
Female: 100%, Female, i just love spending the day at the temple. i have to admit i hate the thought of giving up a whole day to go, but it is so worth it once i get there. there were about 12 members of our ward together and we had family names from 2 members. we did initiatory work and an endowment session, so it was a real blessing. i didn't have to drive, was in good company all day and made a quick visit to the bookstore also. i am hoping to someday live closer to a temple, but for now, i will try to remember the wonderful feelings i felt today and continue to attend at least once a month with the ward. for those who live close to a temple, i hope you appreciate it. on the down side, i had planned to call lindsey while in mesa and she was going to meet us at the temple so i could meet mayan. when i first got down to the church this morning, i called ray to let him know i would not be driving and the car would be in the parking lot. i then, hurriedly, gathered my belongings and jumped in another car. it wasn't til i got to thetemple that i realized my phone was not with me (apparently never made it back in the purse, but on the floor of my car) . but i will go visit the morris family sometime next week when di is in phoenix visiting her kids/grandkids, she and i will go see lindsey. so, now that i am refreshed and uplifted, i look forward to the week to come. ray and i just completed the family history/temple class in sunday school and have begun the family search for his family. i am looking forward to seeing what information we can gather and begin the important work to be done for his ancestors. it is such a blessing.
Male: 100%, Female, last week frank minyard, the orleans parish coroner, concluded that he could not determine what caused the death of jannie burgess, a 79-year-old patient who perished at memorial medical center in new orleans after a doctor's orders led her to be given multiple doses of morphine in a short period. the hospital was cut off for several days by the floodwaters of hurricane katrina and a number of patients were found dead with elevated levels of morphine and other drugs. "we cannot tell what she died of except that she was extremely ill," minyard said in a phone interview several hours before a scheduled press conference on thursday. "she had a lot of physiologic reasons to die." minyard said his official finding was that the cause of burgess' death was "unclassified." his ruling makes it highly unlikely that any charges will be brought in the case. the details of burgess' death were first disclosed in a report published by propublica and the new york times magazine last august. her medical records showed that she was repeatedly dosed with morphine after the hospital had lost power, temperatures soared, and rescue helicopters failed to arrive in sufficient numbers. the physician who ordered the medication, dr. ewing cook, said that he intentionally "hastened her demise" because burgess, who had advanced, metastatic uterine cancer, was close to death, was being cared for by nurses whose help was needed elsewhere, and would have suffered greatly if her pain medication wore off during any attempt to evacuate her. "dr. cook thinks that he knocked her off," minyard said, "but we can't prove that. he might have, he might not have. because it's not 100 percent proved, we have to call it unclassified." he said some of the experts he consulted pointed to the fact that burgess' death was recorded as having occurred more than three hours after the last of the morphine injections. cook's attorney, ralph capitelli, called minyard's decision "the correct decision." minyard said that he had not spoken with cook. he said that during his investigation he consulted with four pathologists who work in his office, three local experts and dr. michael baden, a renowned forensic pathologist from new york. baden has said he has a different view of the case. in an interview several months ago, after he reviewed burgess' records, baden said that burgess' death was "no question a homicide." homicide is defined by coroners as a death caused by the action of another person. such findings do not address the issue of intent which is critical to deciding whether a crime has been committed. burgess' daughter, linette burgess guidi, said she had not seen the experts' determinations. she said she hoped that some sort of review board could review cook's actions. "i understand he was under a lot of pressure," she said. "i'm not out for vengeance. i just want to know the truth, i want to know what happened." she added, "there's too many questions." the district attorney in orleans parish, leon cannizzaro, released a statement after minyard's announcement. "since it is the coroner's opinion that this victim did not die as a result of being administered a lethal dose of narcotics, i cannot pursue a homicide charge at this time." minyard conducted his assessment of the burgess case at cannizzaro's request. in september 2009, shortly after the propublica and new york times magazine report, cannizzaro said he asked minyard "to classify the deaths reported in" the article. in 2006, authorities arrested dr. anna pou and nurses lori budo and cheri landry for alleged mercy killings at the same hospital after katrina. a local grand jury heard evidence in the case and declined to bring charges. the nurses and dr. pou emphatically denied that they had murdered patients and the case prompted outrage in new orleans where medical professionals who worked in horrific conditions after the storm were widely viewed as heroes and victims. some close to minyard speculated that the coroner, who recently won re-election to his 10th term, decided to postpone his determination in the case until after the election -- something minyard denies. minyard, 80, said the reason he had not completed his investigation of burgess' death before now was because his office has a great deal of work on other cases and is understaffed. "i've just got too much going," he said when contacted last december. "i just want to make sure when i do it that i have it right."
Male: 100%, Male, are you desperate for an ipad-like device, short on cash, and long on the desire to completely jack up your netbook? well you're in luck, friend, as the proprietor of msi wind fansite insanely wind has crafted a device which may satiate your tablety desires. by taking a u100, removing the keyboard, relocating a touchscreen display to the bottom half of the unit, and doing some simple rewiring, user alexbates has fashioned a tablet which he says bests a device like the ipad or joojoo with "10 times the storage, twice the speed, external video (vga), webcam, usb ports, and built-in multi card reader." of course, as you can tell by the photos, this mod has a ways to go before it's got the fit and finish of the aforementioned devices, and you'll have rev up a compatible, hackintosh build of os x to make it appropriately apple-ish -- but it can clearly be done. while this isn't the first time we've seen this type of modification, it's nice to see the love spreading to various devices (and done in a fashion that doesn't seem overly complicated). from the sounds of things, this project hasn't hit its zenith yet, so we'll be keeping our eyes peeled for a more complete variation of the windlet (our name). for now, hit the read link and keep up with the unfolding saga. 
Female: 100%, Male, i am so surprised, that this early in march, we are already seeing very warm weather. in fact, we did not see the normal canadian winter that i am used to, and the one that i was dreading. i guess it is nice to get a year off, every now and then. there is still a lot of snow on the ground that needs to melt, but it is certainly well on its way. i go outside, and keep thinking that there is still so much snow to melt, but then i simply have to remember how much snow we had prior to the melt starting, and i know things are going down well. i wonder though, if a milder winter this year, means a more intense winter next year? if that is the case, zhifang will be in for a real eye opener, as canada's winter can be something on the extreme side. winter storms hit with a fury, and when all is said and done, the only thing you can do, is find your shovel and start digging out. 
Female: 100%, Male, no, this isn’t an obituary to my blog, though considering the level of inactivity this year, i suppose you could declare it brain dead. did that metaphor make sense? no? good. i’ve still got it. but yes, i’ve been just a bit stressed for time these days, especially now that my training is done and i’m officially on permanent status. my restricted time on the internet is spent either reading blogs, sports news or chatting with people in time zones that really mess with my sleep cycle, none of which inspire a blog post. and then i went to church. it was one of the weekends that i was at home, and as usual i was busy trying to cram in all the things that i missed out during the week, i.e. dongle-free internet, movies, home cooked food, and driving (i really, really miss driving!). however, in an attempt to infuse my short weekend stay with more ‘family time’, my parents decided that i should come with them for a memorial service. you know what they say; nothing brings the family together like a corpse. so i swing by, reluctantly, while pondering the appropriate ‘game face’ to put on while at a memorial service. not too sad (it’s not the funeral) and not too relaxed (you’re supposed to miss the man). it was the 1 year death anniversary of a family acquaintance, an old planter that used to come to our church, and as i sat in the pews reading the order of the service, i realized that this was actually the first time i had attended a memorial service. it was rather awkward for me personally, watching this little parade of children and grandchildren telling the assembly how much they miss this man. it seemed unnecessary to me; surely this would be better suited for a more private and personal gathering. however, the best was definitely saved for last, when the widow and the pastor got up to tell what a fantastic, god-fearing, church-loving man he was. how they could do so with a straight face, heaven only knows. they might as well have told me he was the antichrist's secretary. after ensuring i had indeed heard this right, i started to wonder how people could be so forgiving of those that have passed before us. it’s almost as if insults are forgiven by the time the body hits the floor, debts are forgiven by the time of the homily and extra-marital affairs and murder are forgiven by the time the sand starts piling up on the casket. so is it only in death that we activate our ‘human spirit’? do we have to wait till our last breath has come and gone to see compassion, concern and selective amnesia in our fellow man? i’m reminded of mark twain’s “tom sawyer”, when he and his friends staged their own funeral to milk the sympathy that they knew would be overflowing for them, despite them being a public nuisance. when i was very young, i didn’t see much of my father as he worked late, and so my five year old brain devised a way to ‘check’ how much i missed him. i would imagine him dying, or imagine hearing of his death, and then if i felt immensely sad about it, then i knew that i really did care and i really did miss him. silly, stupid, terrible – and yet, perhaps apt. bottom line: make sure you tell your friends all the things you hate about them right now! you never know when they may drop dead and put you in the unenviable position of having to lie through your teeth at church.
Male: 100%, Male, you wouldn't expect to find "we've tightened up the graphics on episode three" among the usual list of noted improvements between telltale's episodic releases. after all, with endearing, demented characters like sam and max taking up quite a bit of the screen, who cares how many polygons are left for that pot plant in the corner? "we wanted to bump everything up presentation-wise for this season," said designer chuck jordan, drawing attention to the telltale engine's impressive -- nay, tight -- visual enhancements. the penal zone, the first of five monthly episodes comprising sam & max: the devil's playhouse, features noticeably improved lighting, real-time shadows and more expressive facial animation. as jordan pointed out, "an expression can sell a joke for the first time." based on the demo i saw at the game developers conference, it's also apparent that the improved graphics do make a difference to that pot plant. because you transform into one. "when you finally get to control max," jordan said, "it's really weird." like, really really weird. gallery: sam & max: devil's playhouse one of max's newly acquired psychic abilities (accessed from a bizarre first-person viewpoint) allows him to transform into any physical object -- provided he's seen it in the form of a picture or a painting somewhere in the environment (obviously). it's an interesting puzzle-solving device that introduces an ability-driven approach to complement the traditional reliance on inventory item ... and since it lets max turn into stuff like pot plants and bazookas, it's also super funny. more psychic abilities will be unlocked as the season continues -- can they really get stranger than pictorial transformation or telephonic teleportation? -- but the first few already show that telltale is cognizant of the formulaic fallbacks in a few of its games. inventory manipulation has also been inverted, prompting you to select an object in the environment first and then pick an item to use from a redesigned interface. those changes seem to benefit the playstation 3 version of the devil's playhouse, which also abandons the point-and-click interface in favor of direct control over the demented duo on the left analogue stick. of course, it's also worth pointing out that telltale's excellent, unhinged humor still plays a crucial role in sam & max: the devil's playhouse. i don't think fans will be disappointed by the delightful b-movie trappings, not when there's a talking brain, a megalomaniacal ape and a host of unanswered mysteries right from the start. only an enigmatic narrator (criswell's cousin?) hints at an explanation, but it's clear that the inevitably absurd answers will gradually be exposed as the season continues from its potent opener.
Male: 100%, Male, the current push for government-run health care via the nuclear option and last week’s blair house tv snooze-orama are clear demonstrations that barack obama, nancy pelosi, and harry reid share vladimir lenin’s tenacity to impose radical change where it’s not welcome — in fact, where there’s downright hostility to change by a solid majority of americans. and make no mistake, lenin was first and foremost about the will to power. gale winds of public disapproval may be blowing against proposed government-run health care and its proponents, but obama and congressional democratic leaders plod forward with stolid determination, now extending by six weeks the time to work through an acceptable framework to pass so-called health care reform. if that extension fails to secure health care reform legislation, then these leaders may seek another extension, if possible, in an effort to wear down opposition to their designs. before liberals level charges of red-baiting, i’ll offer that the differences between lenin and the bolsheviks and obama and left-wing democrats are significant, many, and varied. through skullduggery, battle, and blood, lenin established a dictatorship of the proletariat, which history has amply shown was a thinly veiled dictatorship by lenin and his communist party heirs. there was nothing “soft” about lenin’s tyranny or stalin’s. the mass graves of tens of millions of victims bear mute testament to these despots’ infamy. obama, pelosi, and reid are decidedly pale reds, or as was said in an earlier generation, “pinkos.” but all three have grand ambitions, make no mistake, to achieve through imposition the social — or should it be said, socialist — democracy that lies with deadening weight across the width and breadth of western europe. these three democratic leaders are working within our system of government to fundamentally alter government’s relationship to the people. if these three succeed, the american experiment in liberty will effectively end. the president and the two congressional leaders are so blinded by their ideology, so bullheaded in accomplishing a radical transformation of health care, that they’ve discarded the common sense and instinct for self-preservation that usually governs politicians’ actions. instead, this triumvirate makes rationalizations for support of a proposal that’s been doa almost from its inception.
Female: 100%, Male, i awoke to all the snow reports in the area reading between two and four inches. then it was off to the webcams and cdot cams. vail pass looked snowy and so did the top of sun up, i was head over the pass today for some more turns at vail. conditions were awesome, or crappy, depending on who you rode with on the chair. i will go with the former as will my new friend i made on high noon. we lapped the chair a couple times together and both decided that although there was a definite crust under that few inches of fluff, it was pretty damn good skiing. the outside parts of the feet started to get to the point of ice bricks and the wind was biting my face. after four hours of powder hunting i decided it was time to head to the front side and get back to the truck. stopped to buy the essentials for some chili, now off to tend to that.
Male: 100%, Male, windows phone 7 series. get used to the name, because it's now a part of the smartphone vernacular... however verbose it may seem. today microsoft launches one of its most ambitious (if not most ambitious) projects: the rebranding of windows mobile. the company is introducing the new mobile os at mobile world congress 2010, in barcelona, and if the press is anything to be believed, this is just the beginning. the phone operating system does away with pretty much every scrap of previous mobile efforts from microsoft, from the look and feel down to the underlying code -- everything is brand new. 7 series has rebuilt windows mobile from the ground up, featuring a completely altered home screen and user interface experience, robust xbox live and zune integration, and vastly new and improved social networking tools. gone is the familiar start screen, now replaced with "tiles" which scroll vertically and can be customized as quick launches, links to contacts, or self contained widgets. the look of the os has also been radically upended, mirroring the zune hd experience closely, replete with that large, iconic text for menus, and content transitions which elegantly (and dimensionally) slide a user into and out of different views. the os is also heavily focused on social networking, providing integrated contact pages which show status updates from multiple services and allow fast jumps to richer cloud content (such as photo galleries). the xbox integration will include live games, avatars, and profiles, while the zune end of things appears to be a carbon copy of the standalone device's features (including fm radio). besides just flipping the script on the brand, the company seems to be taking a much more vertical approach with hardware and user experience, dictating rigid specs for 7 series devices (a specific cpu and speed, screen aspect ratio and resolution, memory, and even button configuration), and doing away with carrier or partner ui customizations such as sense or touchwiz. that's right -- there will be a single windows phone identity regardless of carrier or device brand. those new phones will likely look similar at first, featuring a high res touchscreen, three front-facing buttons (back, start, and perhaps not shockingly, a bing key), and little else. carrier partnerships are far and wide, including at&t, deutsche telekom ag, orange, sfr, sprint, telecom italia, telefónica, telstra, t-mobile usa, verizon wireless and vodafone, while hardware partners include dell, garmin-asus, htc, hp, lg, samsung, sony ericsson, toshiba and qualcomm. we're told that we likely won't get to see any third-party devices at mwc, though microsoft is showing off dev units of unknown origin, and the first handsets are supposed to hit the market by the holidays of this year.
Male: 100%, Female, venezuela, already under watch from the likes of reporters sans frontieres for jeopardizing press freedom, appears to be edging closer towards the type of restrictive governmental internet interference as seen in cuba, china and iran. hugo chavez, the venezuelan president, has called for greater regulation of the internet this weekend, with the following statement, as reported by reuters: “the internet cannot be something open where anything is said and done. every country has to apply its own rules and norms.” chavez is said to have singled out one website as an example where such an “open” policy has troubled him. noticierodigital had a post up for two days suggesting that diosdado cabello, a senior minister and close aide of chavez, had been assassinated. “we have to act. we are going to ask the attorney general for help, because this is a crime. i have information that this page periodically publishes stories calling for a coup d’etat. that cannot be permitted,” chavez said. twitter (twitter) and facebook (facebook) are also said to have come under criticism from chavez, with the president reported to have complained “that people use such sites to spread unfounded rumors.” recently, he called twitter messages a “tool of terror.” chavez has already moved to control tv and radio networks in the country – in august last year 34 broadcasters were closed down on “administrative grounds” while chavez’s own lengthy presidential broadcasts are now aired compulsorily across both terrestrial and cable tv stations. chavez expressing such negative interest in the online world will no doubt be met with great concern by those who oppose him, as well as in the wider world. chavez’s comments serves to remind all of us — regardless of nationality — about the importance of a free and open internet. when it ceases to be such, it’s no longer the world wide web but a poor imitation propagated by repressive regimes.
Male: 100%, Male, in one room, meade esposito, the democratic boss from brooklyn, was tightening his grip on the brooklyn waterfront. next door, new york’s former mayor, john v. lindsay, was struggling with the teachers strike of 1968. and in the third room, an idealistic young woman from the midwest was trying to teach poetry at rikers island. it was just another day at a recording studio in manhattan where new york stories are lifted off the printed page and into the spoken word for blind new yorkers seeking audio versions of books about their city. the little-known service is run by the new york public library out of the andrew heiskell braille and talking book library on west 20th street. “a lot of the books we record fall into that ‘new yorkana’ category,” said susan mosakowski, a playwright and theater producer who runs the program, which puts out up to 50 titles a year, many of them new york-related books that have not had wide enough appeal to have been recorded by a publisher. “we have a lot of readers asking for books with a local interest, a local focus,” she said. dozens of new york-related books are displayed here: “nypd: a city and its police,” by james lardner and thomas reppetto;” “the seltzer man” by ken rush, about a veteran brooklyn seltzer-schlepper; “upper west side story,” by peter salwen. a federal regulation enacted in the 1990s allows the library to record audio versions of books without having to secure publishing rights. ms. mosakowski has the luxury of being able to draw on new york city’s deep pool of vocal talent. readers have included the broadway actor jeffrey kuhn and julie pasqual, a storyteller, dancer and circus clown.
Female: 82%, Female, i have the urge to blog, even after barely surviving nablo. crazy!anyone know knows me irl knows i can really get rambling about television - because i love to ramble on about my favorite, and not-so-favorite shows. however, i don't usually like to write about it, because i prefer to engage someone else in a discussion. not scribble out my thoughts, and wait to see if anyone replies, and then get wrapped up in that wacky back-and-forth internet conversation. i like to do it up front, face to face, nose to nose. old school, as it were.but after a long and one-sided chat with philsy today (who is exhausted after finishing scoring his first feature, holy poop on a plate!), i decided to turn loose a few thoughts for ya'll to chew on, add to, or spit out. so here it is:for the past few months, i've had an on-again-off-again romance (or been boink-buddies, if you prefer) with glee.okay. i get it. glee is awesome, for a lot of obvious reasons. the pilot alone reminded me to not stop believing, and embarrassing as tis is, i like to dial this up full-blast whenever i'm having a "i'm a hack writer and i suck and i have no business doing this and i have the vocabulary of a pre-schooler" moment. the premise is fresh and unique - the cast is spectacular. the bones of the story arcs for the first season are clever and interesting.however... about 75% of the episodes after the pilot follow a formula like this: someone gets mad/upset/threatened. they quit glee. everyone works to get them back, and they do. the end.or...someone (or something) threatens to shut glee down. glee kids scramble to resolve the conflict. conflict is resolved. the end.now, i know that some pretty big stakes are being spun over the first season for individual character story arcs, so i can appreciate that they're working to weave a lot together. but really... does almost every episode have to focus on glee club losing members or being shut down? could we not build out more stories about the characters, to help the audience develop deeper relationships wih them and learn more about them, and forge episodes around that? they did manage to do it, for that remaining 25%. i'm confident they can continue to do it if they try - but right now i feel like i'm being fed a lot of filler and recycled drama.in fact, there was one storyline in particular this week that was like nails down a blackboard. turn back now if you don't want *** spoilers ***!glee club, unbeknownst to their director will schuester, participated in a professional television commercial for a mattress store - although they did not accept payment, they did receive a shipment of mattresses, an honorarium for their work. after discovering his wife terri was not actually pregnant, a very upset will returned to school late at night, found the pile of mattresses, pulled the plastic off one and slept on it. what will didn't realize, was that by accepting payment (even in pocket-coil form) he was thereby upping the status of glee club from amateur to professional, thus disqualifying them from preforming in sectionals.this resulted in a screaming match between will and sue (the overly-aggressive cheerleading coach antagonist) in the principal's office, where it was concluded by the end of the scene that nothing had changed, and the kids would now be disqualified.except that a short few scenes later, it was determined that the glee kids could go on to perform at sectionals if they returned the unused mattresses, but that will would not be permitted to coach them or participate further because he'd already had a good nights sleep on one of them and, well, you just can't return a used mattress.huh.if we'd had that resolve back in the argument scene, then we could have pushed will's character a little further. because even though he cares about the glee kids more than anything, deep down, he's really there because hents to recapture the greatest moments of his life - his youth - which were with glee. his marriage is failing - the woman he truly loves is slipping away, and glee's all he's got. so to see him struggle, and ultimately give up glee in order to let them succeed would have been a nice little tid-bit of development. maybe i'm way off, i don't know. but that's what i'd have done.next week's the finale. i'm excited to see what they'll do with it, but more importantly, i'm extremely curious to see where they're going to take the next season. hopefully, it's a whole lot more of that 25%.
Female: 100%, Female, this is a small little story about an outlandish girl named victoria and a cheerleader named kimiko. even though they are different, they love each other. read on about this little exert from their lives. victoria stops her car at the top of the mountain on the ledge with the wooden fence at the end. she steps out of her old, beaten up, black mustang and sits on the hood. victoria stretches out her legs and lays back against the windshield. kimiko very gracefully steps out of the passenger seat and sits on the edge of the hood of the car. “there’s a party at jimmy’s place later. maybe we can stop by?” “why, kimi? so all your hollister addicted friends can ridicule me when we show up?” “you know, they don’t really hate you like you think they do.” “i don’t care.” kimiko sighs. “i know.” victoria reaches into the pocket of her black skinny jeans and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. she takes one of the white sticks and rests it in her mouth. she lights the tip and breaths in. “i wish you wouldn’t smoke. i hate that habit.” “what the hell are you saying? aren’t you aware that basically all your friends at the party you want to go to smoke weed.” “oh,” she adjusts her bra strap through her long-sleeved, pink, abercrombie shirt and runs her fingers through her long, golden hair, “i never thought of that.” “oh, what a surprise.” kimiko looks down at the ground and kicks a rock. victoria notices the change in mood. “i-i’m sorry, that was uncalled for.” she throws the cigarette on the dirt next to the car. “come on, sit next to me,” victoria pats the metal hood to the left of her. kimiko smiles and sits next to victoria. “you like my skirt?” she straightens out her light blue mini-skirt. “surprisingly, yes. on anyone else, it would look horrible. you just make everything look good.” she straightens out her johnny the homicidal maniac t-shirt. “you look good, too.” “you’re just saying that.” she scratches her head. “i’m not. you don’t really like compliments, so i would only say it if i really meant it.” “heh. thanks.” she puts her arm around kimiko and they stare into the sky. “i love this spot. what about you, kimi?” “it’s good.” “good? just good? this spots amazing, especially at night. where the sky is bright with the stars and moon and we get to look down on the lights of the pathetic little city below.” “i’ve never viewed it that way.” “yeah. no one’s seen it that way, especially your friends.” “why do you hate them so much?” “they’ve treated me horrible since i’ve known them.” “i apologize for them.” “i wish that meant something.” kimiko leans over and kisses victoria on the lips. “i love you.” “i love you, too.” “why do you love me? you hate my friends, my cloths, the fact that i’m a cheerleader, and just basically everything i represent. so, why do you love me?” “i don’t know. when i found out there was another lesbian in this town, i had to meet her. at first i really hated you just because of what you described. but, i kept talking to you and realized you were better than i thought and i really liked you. i’m really happy you aren’t like everyone else. on that note, why do you like me?” “you’re really cute and you’re really nice. like, you don’t look like you’d be nice. but, you’re amazingly sweet. it was really surprising. no offense.” “heh. none taken.” victoria hugs kimiko and holds her in her arms. “i really love you, kimi.” “i love you, too.” a couple minutes of silence later, victoria pats kimiko on the back. “come on, lets go.” she hops off the hood of the car. “what?” she follows. “it’s getting late. we should get going.” “where are we going? to your place?” “nah. you wanted to go to that party right? we’ll just go there. you’d be happy to see your friends.” she sits in the drivers seat. “but, you’d be miserable.” she opens the car door and gets in. “but, you’d be happy. and, that means more to me.” she turns the key and starts the car. “i’d rather go to your house. i’d have more fun there.” she fastens her seatbelt. “alright. let’s go there.” they drive back 
Male: 100%, Male, last season, the cleveland browns were...for lack of a better term, a hot mess. it all stemmed from the quarterback position, where 2007 first round pick brady quinn and relative journeyman derek anderson took turns not really getting anything done. sure, the browns won their last four games of the season, but they still finished 5-11, and that late run was largely due to running back jamal harrison, who tallied 558 of his 852 rushing yards in the team's final three games. as soon as the season ended, they agreed to bring in mike holmgren, the former head coach of both the green bay packers and seattle seahawks who currently has a number of former assistants working in head coaching jobs around the league. back in january, on dan patrick's radio show, holmgren said that he would be sure to decide on a quarterback before training camp started and stick with him. little did we know he wasn't actually referring to anyone that was on the roster at that time. i personally was certain he was talking about brady quinn, since it's just not necessary to devote time to derek anderson, who is as wysiwyg (what you see is what you get) as they come under center. however, the events of the past week have been truly surprising, and have me re-evaluating holmgren's plan. anderson - considered a backup by most - was released, no shock there. however, cleveland brought in ex-seahawk (and holmgren draftee) seneca wallace to replace anderson. they also have reportedly told teams that quinn is available in trades, brought recent ex-carolina panther jake delhomme in for a visit today, and a

Female: 100%, Male, we went to an outdoor symphony presentation of the bbc blue planet. the fine arts museum has a hillside that provides near perfect seating for such an event. and it only rained enough to cause them to pass out free raincoats (flimsy but effective), not to get soaked....... a friend ken elder passed away...one more farewell gathering missed while in taiwan. we drove, well melissa did, we rode, to taichung to support a fundraiser and visit some friends that teach at morrison academy who melissa went to russia with in 1994. yep that long ago! about 2/3 of the way there melissa's car overheated. we stopped at a rest stop. store, gas station and restrooms. (90 urinals)! once we added 2 liters of water and the engine cooled some off we went. well about 20 minutes later we pulled over and (short version) rode in the car on the back of a flat bed tow truck into the next city to get a new thermostat and radiator. sunday morning no less! and back on the road in 2 hours! we had dinner at ponderosa, there are 2 in taichung, with the robarts then went back to their apartment for a short visit before driving home. it sure was nice to not have the extra servicing stops! this time the rest stop only had about 60 urinals.......... it was like driving to regina and back for the day. we'd never do that! well almost, never!! dogs and monday morning hair appointments pressed the return decision. this afternoon i was out walking and noticed one clinic 'urology and dermatology' a curious combination in my limited experience! my mind wondered........i'll let you do yours and keep mine to myself, thank you very much......... well that's about it!

Male: 100%, Male, at our mobilize 09 conference, frank meehan, ceo of london-based inq, told me that his company was going to follow on the heels of its successful facebook phone with more devices, including lower-cost smartphones targeting fast-growing mobile markets such as india. today, the company launched its social mobile phones in india — and inq has roped in ms dhoni, captain of indian cricket team, as its spokesperson. aircel, a mobile carrier, will be selling the device to its customers. the inq mini 3g and the inq chat 3g will be available in india. the inq chat 3g is a qwerty device. the highly competitive indian mobile market has made it difficult for carriers to bank solely on voice revenues. the inq devices are being made available at a time when indian carriers are looking for ways to goose their data revenues.
Male: 100%, Male, senator john barrasso m.d. (r-wy), ranking member of the subcommittee on oversight in the senate environment and public works committee, recently released a report [pdf]on the subcommittee’s work in the first year of the obama administration. the report has less to it than might be imagined — in the first year, the subcommittee has failed to meet or to hold a single hearing of its own. “there were exactly two hearings in 2009,” barrasso said, “a joint hearing with the full committee on june 9th, and a joint hearing with the subcommittee on water and wildlife on july 8th.” the subcommittee was chartered by senator barbara boxer (d-ca), chair of the environment and public works committee, to perform oversight on the science involved with environmental issues. “senator boxer wanted the subcommittee to perform oversight on the bush administration, not the current administration,” senator barrasso said. “we have made repeated requests to the chairman of the subcommittee [senator sheldon whitehouse (d-ri)] to hold hearings [in the past year] but no hearings have been held. it has been a lost year for science oversight in the senate.” “there have been plenty of reasons to hold hearings,” barrasso said. “for example, in april 2009, shawn mcgibbon, a career attorney with small business administration, wrote part of a memo saying the epa had not considered the economic consequences of an endangerment finding for carbon dioxide.” when the memo became known, mcgibbons was “smeared as a ‘bush holdover’” even though she was hired during the clinton administration. later, mcgibbons was replaced by president obama. in another incident, dr. alan carlin, a 39-year veteran of the epa, prepared a report skeptical of the real human impact on the climate. carlin (who has since written several articles for pajamas media) was instructed not to disseminate the report and, as kim strassel reported in the wall street journal, was denounced by “unnamed epa officials” as a “climate change denier.” dr. carlin eventually left the epa.
Male: 100%, Male, recommendation engine hunch confirms that they’ve raised a new round of financing – $12 million – led by khosla ventures. partner gideon yu, who joined khosla ventures last year, was previously the cfo of facebook. he is now joining hunch’s board of directors as part of the deal. hunch was valued at $52 million in the round. i spoke to cofounder caterina fake this evening about the round. fake says that hunch, which is less than a year old, now has lots of data to work with in making recommendations. in fact, she says, users have answered nearly 50 million questions on hunch since launch, and the company can use that data to make better and better recommendations. wikipedia founder jimmy wales joined the company’s board of directors in late 2009.
Female: 100%, Female, lright folks, it's time for us to have a heart to heart talk: i hate the beach. ironic, then, that i'm currently sitting on huntington beach in southern california, eh? i know, i know, "that's absurd!" you say, "she's a total freak," you're thinking. but to each his own, i say, and my reasons for this hatred are four fold: 1. it's hot. i hate being hot. i hate it a whooooole lot. if i had a choice between going to the bahamas or going to alaska in the middle of winter, i would choose alaska. if i had a choice between dying in the middle of the mojave desert and freezing to death in siberia, i'd choose siberia. 2. there is sand - everywhere. you go in the water, come out and sand gets stuck on everything. not to mention that it gets lodged in orifices you didn't even know you had. 3. the water is salty. i prefer fresh water that i could drink if i was dying of thirst instead of having to stare at water that would kill me even faster. also, salt water does not smell good - or taste good, for that matter. 4. there are half naked people who should definitely not be half naked. however, my current view from this floral beach chair looks something like this:

Male: 100%, Female, after more than 35 years, sen. patrick leahy, d-vermont, (pictured far left) and sen. richard lugar, r-indiana, (pictured far right) are senior senators. a lot has changed - except for the friendship, which has proven stronger than their political differences.. (photo credit: getty images/file) washington (cnn) - while many in washington believe that bipartisanship is long gone, two seasoned senators say it's not - at least not yet. the relationship between sen. richard lugar, a conservative republican from indiana, and sen. patrick leahy, a liberal democrat from vermont, was born in obscurity - two very junior senators at the far reaches of a committee room table. leahy recalled a story from a time when their voices were virtually muted in a committee meeting. "neither one of us could hear what they [committee leaders] were muttering. and i said, 'well, wait a minute, could i ask what was in that amendment?' you could see the two look down like 'who the heck are these two guys at the end?' [he] takes his gavel and said, 'we're adjourned.' " after more than 35 years, leahy and lugar are senior senators. a lot has changed - except for the friendship, which has proven stronger than their political differences.
Male: 100%, Male, it goes without saying that timing is everything. you can be like friendster and show up too soon to the social networking party and then blow it. or you can be like the ipod and make a splash despite being a late entrant to the mp3 player market. unity technologies, a 3-d gaming platform, has seen this movie from all sides. after struggling for nearly six years, the company’s gaming platform took off when apple released iphone and ipod touch. with a platform that lets developers build lightweight, online 3-d games — perfectly suited for the iphone os-based devices — unity became a disruptor in the games business virtually overnight. and it’s been on a bit of a roll over the past year, with a client roster that includes big names like electronic arts, the cartoon network and disney. mobile developers love the company, which secured a $5.5 million series a round led by sequoia in october of 2009. but it wasn’t always salad days for the company, which was originally based in copenhagen, denmark and is now headquartered in the bay area, as is made clear in my chat with unity ceo david helgason.
Female: 100%, Male, what do you think of when everything around you suddenly slows down? when you are acutely aware of every tenth of a second as it passes? i woke up saturday morning to kat's music in her room. when i looked in on her, she was dancing. spinning in circles with her arms and hands outstretched, a huge smile on her face with her hair thrown around. "up, daddy! up!" so i picked her up and danced to itsy bitsy spider. her face in mine, watching her smile and hearing her giggle. we spun around together like grinning fools, enjoying the moment. nothing else really mattered. as the truck tire fell off the pavement, the dot hadn't plowed and the front end swung around, i wasn't driving fast. maybe 55 mph. the roads were a mess, snow covered and no way to tell where the shoulder hid, waiting to pull you down to a catastrophe. the boy has been sick. he had my cold and now has my cough. he has a rash and other problems that make him miserable. last night jill and i held him and tried to comfort him. he would have none of it. he stood and screamed at the injustice of it all; why did he have to hurt? did he really want these teeth? we held him and tried to comfort him and share his frustration. the truck is sliding sideways, free of friction from the road and the tires held to nothing, just sliding over snow and ice. the headlights pointed into the median and the road starting to curve into my travel. counter steer, just like i was taught in drivers ed, over 25 years ago. pray, just like i was taught at home nearly 40 years ago. kat, wound up and cranky. cabin fever making her temper boil. i found her at the door, in her jacket, hat and mittens. crying to do something. outside? sled, she tells me. so i dressed quickly, put on her boots and carried her out and got the sled. i tell her to hold on and enjoy! she is going down the hill, faster and farther. looking back for the security of daddy watching over her. laughter and dancing, jumping up and down. again! again. four trips in all, up the hill, position in the sled and point down the hill. go! down the hill, faster than before, i hear her calling, daddy! there is a van stuck in the median. the truck has swung nearly 180* and i see the van coming up on my left. or is it? the van is still, i am shooting towards it when the back of the truck hits the thick, wet, sticky snow of the median and the front end snaps around like a whip. the van seems to pass me by, when i should know i am the passer by. nose into the deeper snow, slowing down as though i just drove into a lake. snow splashing up all around, i see the snow pass over the hood and past my windows. how deep will i go? sunday morning, jill took kyle to the dr, leaving kat home with me. kat is mommy's little girl and spends a half hour crying for mommy! and looking all over the house trying to find her mommy. i distract her finally with the music from the day before and once again we are dancing, cheek to cheek. in a rare moment of perspective, i marvel and appreciate the moment. she doesn't want me to hold her often and we don't dance together. "this is precious and i don't want it to stop." i am in the moment and i know what priceless really means. the truck is nearly in the other lane. headlights flash in front of me, staring into my eyes. this makes it hard to see and i have my eyes open to meet my fate. what will happen when i finally come to rest? i am now heading back towards the middle of the median, snow showering all around me. will my planner hit me in the head? will my flashlight shake free and fracture my teeth? will i be a burden to my family, paralyzed or blind? is this all karma; am i wearing clean underwear? a rough night last night. wife and i got back to sleep around 530. we snuggled up close and dozed off. we had each gone to the children to help them get through the night and back to sleep. one woke the other and they both resented the interruption of sleep. we all did. jill and i hit snooze and we wound ourselves closer to one another. i murmured in her ear; we used to do this every morning, bk. we cuddled and snuggled and stored up love and affection like squirrels storing nuts, corporate life is like a stark freezing iowa winter. store up your love and affection because outside of this house you don't have many friends or allies to help nourish your spirit. some days that nourishment of your spirit runs out before you get to the safe haven of home. i realize the truck has some response in the wheel. maybe i can, i think. i am at the bottom of the hill, i have been plowing snow for a quarter mile. give it some gas and steer. the worst that can happen is unthinkable; the best that can happen is still possible. the truck responds to the foot feed and slogs its way in the deep snow. thirty more yards, twenty then five and out! we are on the road! careful, don't go to the other ditch and look for cars coming down that hill! keep driving a little faster, up to 45 and pointed in the right direction. lets get home carefully, safely; ten miles to go and the road isn't any cleaner. i park the truck at home and feel kind of weak. shut the garage door and go inside. it is too much to hope the kids are up; it is 8:15. daddy's home. a bundle of long brown curly hair runs out of her bedroom and throws herself around my knees. up, up, up she commands. i pick up my daughter and a tear slides down my cheek. jill comes into the kitchen carrying kyle and we have a group hug. a hug has never been more precious or needed than right at that moment. i would freeze that moment in time if i could and never regret it. i feel like it took thirty minutes to drive through that median and another hour to get home but that hug lasted for barely an instant.
Male: 100%, Male, the nexus one is coming to verizon — no, really, two months after a deal was announced by google, the device is on its way. htc has begun shipping the cdma version of google’s nexus one to verizon wireless, according to a report in the chinese-language economic daily news (hat tip, digitimes). the nation’s largest carrier will begin selling the gadget in the next few weeks, joining t-mobile usa, which has supported the “google phone” since its january launch. but that won’t do much to boost google’s mobile effort unless mountain view throws some real marketing muscle behind the nexus one. there’s a lot to like about the nexus one, which om has praised as “the best android phone yet.” the phone rocks the powerful 1 ghz qualcomm snapdragon processor and solid mobile browser, and is closely integrated with applications from both google and third-party developers. but sales have been tremendously disappointing, prompting goldman sachs last week to slash its 2010 sales estimates for the nexus one by a whopping 70 percent. that lack of movement can be directly traced to an almost utter lack of marketing for the phone. (that’s a lesson palm has learned with its pre. twice.) google’s promotion of its flagship device consisted largely of a placing a modest link on its home page, and carriers — which are rightly terrified of their brands being elbowed out of the way — have only minimally backed the gadget. worse, the phone is available only through google’s online store, which most smartphone shoppers surely don’t even know exists. and that model isn’t likely to change with verizon wireless, as kevin at jkontherun noted last week. google has said since january that the nexus one would be coming to verizon wireless, and the company is wise to combine its impressive hardware with verizon’s rock-solid network. but if google is really going to move the needle with its flagship device, it’s going to have to back it with some big-budget marketing campaigns.
Male: 100%, Male, during the review of the environmental protection agency budget in today’s senate environment and public works committee hearing, both senator barbara boxer — the chair of the committee — and epa administrator lisa jackson distanced themselves from the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) fourth assessment report (ar4). boxer and jackson’s statements, in addition to being a striking change in policy, are problematic because u.s. climate science is very closely tied to the ipcc reports (as christopher horner showed in his recent pjm series on the nasa foia emails.) the statements by boxer and jackson followed senator inhofe’s release (see the pjm exclusive report) in his opening statement of a minority staff report documenting many flaws in the ipcc report and the other evidence revealed in the climategate files.

Female: 100%, Female, lately it’s been abnormal to see a smile on my face, life has been so crazy busy, hectic, stressful, dull, annoying and well pissy! that when i do actually have a smile on my face people tend to wonder what i am actually up to. i hate to sound like a broken record and i’m most positive that i’m not the only one w/in this great big world of ours that is not having a great 2009. i’m truly hoping for a bright 2010. but lately, life has been full of one big disappointment after another. my kid’s fathers… huge disappointments in the daddy arena. they just can’t seem to pull their heads outta their asses to step up and do what needs to be done to take care of their half of the responsibilities. my son’s father blames it all on me.. i left him, so therefore it’s all my responsibility. my daughters father… well… i don’t even know where to begin there, so let’s just suffice it to say that it’s most important for him to either impregnate as many women as possible or smoke up his entire life. im telling ya, i sure do know how to pick them! but lately… there has been very little to smile about. my kids make me smile. even if they are teenagers, and are slowly driving me drink (kidding i don’t drink anymore than normal) i’ve been really sick… the plus side of being sick is that i’ve pretty much kicked the smoking habit. although i’m not saying i’m a non-smoker. i’m just saying... i haven’t had one for a week now because i’ve been so sick and i do not even desire one. so that’s a plus. i met someone who makes me smile. it’s all about the person’s personality. i adore his personality. he makes me laugh he makes me smile he makes me feel he makes me happy i don’t want to feel, be happy, laugh or smile because when it all goes away what are you left with? hurt/pain/anger i can’t go there again

Female: 100%, Female, well, where do i start.... we took porter to the ent dr for his followup appointment on monday. he had been having a really snotty nose and cough, and had gone back to not sleeping well. we were worried that his tubes had come out or were stopped up. his tubes looked good (yea!), but dr norris was worried that he still had some ongoing infection in his adenoids. he gave him augmentin, nystatin, and ear drops. augmentin is really bad on the gi tract, and porter does not handle antibiotics well, so we were worried about how this would go. he started having diarrhea last night, and his poor little booty was so raw and painful that we skipped his dose last night. we decided he should probably stay home from daycare today so i could keep an eye on his bottom better and keep it "pasted" (caked with boudreaux's butt paste). between me working nights and having a diarrhea day ahead, we had all the makings for a miserable day, but it was just the opposite. we had a great day!!! porter and i went to our favorite park at 9:00am, stayed for over an hour, and were filthy when we left. we ran by target to get a few things, and porter fell asleep on the way home. i transferred him to our bed and took a nap with him. he slept for 3 hours!!! he ate cheetos and a hotdog for a late lunch and then i set him up in our bedroom and bathroom to play while i worked out. he danced to his video and played all over me while i worked out. we tried to take a quick walk after my workout, but it started raining on us and we had to run home. porter didn't mind. he was just squinting and smiling in his stroller. then we both got a shower in our bathroom. porter loves taking a shower--i just hold him with his back to the water and he lays his head on my shoulder and let's the water run over him. he actually fell asleep in the shower one time. after we got out, jared got home soon, and we picked up a pizza for supper before i left for work. i know i'll be tired later, but it was worth getting to spend a day with my little buddy. a potential bad day couldn't have been any better! here are some pictures from the day.on the way to the park! 
Female: 100%, Male, time for your tuesday edition of the deadspin funbag. find more of drew's stuff at ksk or on twitter. today, we're poop, menus, minesweeper, afros, death, gatorade, gayness, and more. i've been losing weight recently, and one of the joys of losing weight is overemphasizing my own awe at my body's transformation. "why are my pants so loose? why am i not sweating in my sleep? i feel stronger. more agile. what's happening to my body?" i'm not saying i'm becoming spiderman, but i wouldn't rule out such things. also, my old kasabian shirt fits again. it's the little things. onto your letters. carlos: me and my brother have come to the conclusion that whoever dies first will haunt the shit out of the other person. i'm gonna be a bad motherfuckin' ghost if i die, i will pull your teeth while you sleep, you bastard. fear me. well, that's the main issue. can you move around tangible objects when you're a ghost? because that would be awesome. if you're a ghost, you have to be bored out of your mind, what with the whole stuck in purgatory business. the only thing there is to do if you're a ghost is spend most of your time fucking with the living. and so, like carlos, i'd be a huge dick if i were a ghost. i'd turn on the faucets while you were taking a shit, just so you'd clench up, break off the turd, and get all mad. also, i'd write out lots of vague messages on steamy bathroom mirrors. shit like, this is the dawn of the end. also, i'd implore people in the house to avenge my death, even if i died normally. they don't know i died of a heart attack, so why not give them the illusion that i was murdered in the house, and that they must find the killer? old man jenkins next door! you can't trust him! there are times, late at night, when my wife is asleep but i'm still tossing and turning, when i wonder if our house is haunted. it's not. but what if the specter of some old lady came through the wall and just stared at me? what would i do, apart from shit my pants? i visualize that shit, and then it fucks with me the rest of the night. at college, one of the guys i sat on the football bench with told me his dorm room was haunted. one night, he was sleeping in his bed. he stirred, opened his eyes, and saw a dark figure standing by the bed. when he reached to touch the figure, his hand went through it. he turned on the light and there was nothing there. haunted! sure, he was almost certainly lying. but then again, there could have been a girl who had her throat slit by a demented professor in that very same room. i rule out nothing. just once, i'd like to find myself in a haunted house or hotel room. just so i can tell people of my brush with the paranormal. i get very annoyed with reality shows about ghosts (like ghost hunters) that supposedly track ghosts and then come up with proof that includes a video still featuring a smudge of light glare. that's no ghost, you fuckers. where are the chains?!
Male: 100%, Male, this has been the long, hot summer of obamacare. the president’s plan to change our health care system has led to ugly confrontations between ardent supporters and those who want no part of it. repeatedly, arguments have broken out where opponents object to some provision and the president’s zealots retort that they’re lying or have been duped. i would like to suggest that such arguments are beside the point. the specifics of the legislation are shifting and liable to change. what’s really important is the overall concept. we’re used to hearing that “the devil is in the details,” but in this instance, we should instead concentrate on the big picture. here is the big picture: do we want a health care system that’s overwhelmingly political in nature? president obama believes we need a system mainly directed by federal mandates and prohibitions. if he has his way, our already somewhat politicized system would become heavily politicized. supposedly that would be in the public interest. there are many americans, however, who think that a heavily politicized health care system would be much worse. i’m among them. we believe, fundamentally, that systems of any kind that are dominated by politics do not do a good job of satisfying human needs. whether it’s health care, food, housing, or anything else, government intrusion leads to increasing costs, declining quality, and the loss of freedom. we get far better results from systems based on freedom and voluntary exchange. when individuals make decisions, they know their own circumstances and will either benefit from good choices or suffer the consequences of bad ones. that creates a strong incentive to make good choices and quickly change when you realize you’ve made a mistake.
Female: 100%, Male, i'm back from my trip overseas and had a blast! but fun was coupled with sadness as day 1 i lose my phone :( that screwed a bit with my plans to tour around as i lost my handy internet-in-pocket device. germany was great, meetings went really well and the weather was great. then onto amsterdam for vacation where it rained a bit everyday, but was still decent weather (and much better than home, so no complaints). one of the work guys ended up coming with me and we met up with friends from his old job. it was definitely a blast being down there with a big group of canadians right in the middle of the olympics. especially since everywhere but north america lists the medal count by # of golds, so canada was #1. don't really want to type out any stories from the trip, but small 'highlights' were: losing phone, breaking glasses, waking up in a small pool of blood (lol), yummy schnitzel, a million gorgeous audis, dutch girls > german girls, casino fun / insane beats, crazy last minute bookings and contingency plans, touring red light district, shopping, etc etc. really can't wait for another trip like this, i love travelling...but the downside, i missed my son like crazy! it was so nice when i got him back. we've had a lot of fun so far since i got back especially because the weather's starting to be nice finally. we're spending a lot of time outside as he chases down birds and plays with rocks etc. he chases me down the street with his hands up to his head like horns or antlers all the while growling as loud as he can. it's hilarious and passerby's can't help but laugh too. on my trip there were so many times i wish i had him with me, love being reunited. but you know what's insanely stupid?!?! ex never went to visit her family. no road trip, nothing. ie, absolutely no reason to use the piece of l's luggage i requested and was adamantly denied since she "needed" it. such bs!
Male: 100%, Male, using a camera as an input device is hardly a new idea -- even on a mobile device -- but most examples so far have been to enable functionality not possible on a touchscreen. as master's student daniel bierwirth has shown in the video after the break, however, a phone on a camera can also be used as an alternative input method for features like scrolling or zooming, potentially allowing for easier interaction on devices with smaller screens. bierwirth also takes the idea one step further, and sees the system eventually including a second camera that's worn by a person, which would be able to detect when your hands are near the phone and allow for a range of other gestures. check out his full report at the link below.
Female: 100%, Female, have now received the instructions for a round robin challenge that i have agreed to take part in. the round robin starts today. this month:- 1. you have to make a piece of fabric, a fat 1/4 in size. you can stamp, dye, print etc. you all have a theme to work to, and you can use architecture, culture, clothes etc as your design source. 2. your fabric must to be passed onto the next person by the 31st march, with your design source/image to show that person where your ideas are coming from. using the random number generator this is what you have got- 1) nickie-europe 2) margaret-asia 3) di-australasia 4) deb-africa 5) sharne-america's i will email you all on march 22nd with info on who to pass your fabric onto. please post photo's on your blog of what you are doing with the challenge. so now i seriously need to get my thinking hat on. it's been a while since i did any design work of any description and i felt that i should challenge myself again. also have the chairmans challenge at ferrers quilters to think about. this is to make a miniature quilt any style any technique. a miniature is not something that i have attempted before so again a challenge for me. also have a stall at a tattoo convention at the end of the month and need to produce some stock for that. phew! on top of all this i have a new role at work and this is another new challenge. i am still enjoying the belly dancing immensely and have (hopefully) booked tickets for an all day event which will include me doing 3 workshops. very scary as i am a complete beginner.one of them is on american tribal style which is a form of belly dancing that i really like and may want to continue with.although the event is in andover the tutor for this ats is local so it would not be too hard to get to classes. so, for me, quite enough on my plate at the moment
Female: 100%, Male, to find out what the situation is like in angers, i decided to go and have a walk around the city centre, and see what was open, what was closed, and if i came across any angry protestors. angry protestors i did not find. but was angers crippled by these strikes or not? let’s find out. when walking into down, it did appear to me that it felt a bit quieter than normal. there did not seem to be same number of cars which there normally are through the city centre. there were fewer buses running today in angers, but not to the extent where there were no buses. there seemed to be adequate buses running and on the buses there did not seem to be crushes of people trying to get anywhere. moving into the town, no shops or banks were closed. it did not seem that any of angers’ banks were closed. the main thing which i found in the town was an increase in children. when walking into town, i noticed that the school near where i live was closed: i could see chairs on tables in the building. in town, it was evident that schools and colleges were closed. in the centre of town there were college students skateboarding in the central square, which usually happens only at weekends. moreover, there were many mothers with their children in town today. seemingly trying to find something to do with them. many times i saw a mother with one or two children with her. also i came across a snake of 20 or so 4 or 5 year olds being looked after two or three women. seemingly not enough of them to look after the children who they were looking after. also i came across a group of 14/15 year olds walking through town, about 25/30 of them, obviously not at school today, on a kind of shopping trip instead, all of them with h&m bags. the amount of children and teenagers in the town centre obviously meant that many educational establishments were today closed today. i then went across town to check out what was happening at the station. on the face of things you wouldn’t know anything was wrong. all the cancelled trains appear to have been taken off the departure board to hide the problems perhaps. whatever, there seemed to be enough trains running today through angers, only difference on the board was the addition of “autocar” by some destinations. even the post office was open, albeit with a reduced service. evidently some staff must have stayed away as there was a sign at the door saying that they were only serving people who wanted to send mail or make cash withdrawals. services like the firemen seemed to be unaffected, luckily! however when passing the fire station i did see the following:
Female: 100%, Female, even though i don't have time to sit and write, i am gonna do it anyway. maybe after the new year, i'll get back to writing. i know i've said it before but i can feel words developing in my mind and an urge to sit and write is stirring a little. it's been a difficult year. may be 2010 will be brighter. i know some major changes will be made and have already started... granny is now in a nursing home that has a special alzheimer's unit. the friday after t-day, she got out of her house at 12:30 am and wasn't found until 8:30 am. her core temp was 91 and she was in intensive care for a few days. luckily she survived. it was cold but not below freezing all that night. the irony of it all was that she had ventured across the road over towards where some construction had been going on. she fell behind some heavy brush and couldn't get up. it's amazing she lived, especially since she was only wearing a thin nightie, no shoes or socks. but luckily for us she is in good hands now and has no major damage done to her body due to the hyperthermia she sufferred. mom was told that granny has the vitals of a teenager. you know...god does take care of his own. granny was a very religious lady all of her life and god won't forget that. sam's better and was working yesterday. i didn't have time to call and check on him. nor have i had time to do anything fun with my chick friends. we may have dinner one night this week to share a drink and to laugh together one last time before the new year. my wish for all is to be happy and to embrace those around you whom you love. life is so short and can change in a heartbeat.
Female: 100%, Female, haai, so why is it that when we're left alone, we get paranoid; thinking up a storm of all the worst things that you can possibly come up with. i mean, why do you have to make sense of everything, why can't we just accept something for what it is. why do we tend to analyze situations that have relatively made slight alterations in it's rather usual straight pattern. what's amazing is when things are back to normal, we so easily forget all the accusations and bogus imagery that went on up in there. it's annoying that so many things were running through my mind in one particular episode. thinking back, i feel pretty stupid for thinking and assuming such things. i feel so, common. 
Male: 100%, Male, custom computer cases that look like spiders aren't generally the sort of thing that are available to public, but lian li's new pc-t1r case is one big exception to the rule, and it's now edged a bit closer to a release. previously only seen in a teaser video, a nearly final version of the case has now landed in the hands of the folks at techpowerup, who have provided us with our first hands-on look at it. what's more, the site also says that the case should sell for "around €150" (or just over $200) when it's released, and that it will be available in black in addition to red. of course, there will be some assembly required -- hit up the link below to see what's in store.
Female: 100%, Female, washed scary pile o' dishes. (last week's cold resulted in a larger-than-normal pile, although i did get some done around wednesday so that i'd have enough bowls and cutlery to make it through the week.) baked chocolate chip banana nut muffins, putting the rest of the nuts and buttermilk in the freezer before they spoiled. (yay for not wasting food! i'm such a slacker...) i even started the muffins before the dishes, so everything except the muffin tins made it into the wash... and the muffin tins could have, but i was pooped with washing dishes by the time the muffins had cooled. baked bread to replace what had been in the freezer so long it was freezer-burned. (i *will* make hummus so that i can actually eat this batch.) the bread dishes (except for the bread pan) made it into the wash too. watered houseplants. cleaned silver spoons and silver necklaces, using the magic "aluminum foil, baking soda, and boiling water" method. it's an awesome method. i tried with hot tap water at first, but it didn't work nearly as well as the boiling water, even after leaving it sit while i had a shower. killed lots of flies, as mentioned previously. you know, reading about venus fly traps, over-feeding isn't a good thing. i suppose three-dozen flies at once probably would be too much? until i find a place to buy a venus fly trap, it's a bit of a moot point, anyway. (and if i bought a sundew too, it would only be one and a half dozen each...)
Female: 100%, Female, phase 1: lagos step 1: arrive at the airport. the power goes out while your luggage is still being brought out on the carrel. so you have to drag your two excessively overweight bags off the carrel while holding on to your precious laptop bag as well the carry-on bag you brought off the plane. then you realize that the carts aren't free…..and you have no naira. so you drape the carry on and laptop bag on each shoulder then drag your two suitcases out of the airport. you get outside and realize that you also have no cell phone and that the nearest call place is "waaaaaay down that way"…… step 2: you leave your aunt's house ready to go a-visiting. then they tell you that the cabs are just a "little up the road". as you have sworn with all that is in you to never get on an okada, you decide to walk there. conveniently, you forget that you're smack dab in the middle of the tropics during harmattan season no less and that when you left it was snowing. you arrive sweating and exhausted at the car park then breathlessly tell the cab man the address. but it's not over, because the bloody bastard is trying to gouge out your eyes and cut off your right arm and left leg (get it??), so you gather your final strength and revive all your haggling skills. finally, when you're both satisfied, you sink into the backseat and endure the hot, dusty ride. phase 2: ibadan step 1: your mom generously drops you off at your friend's house. she even lets you take the wheel. no biggie you think remembering all the weaving through traffic and switching lanes at 100 mph that you've come to enjoy. so you get on the road. it's an easy drive up your long street. you get on the main road, your mom's relaxed. gabbing on the phone informing all and sundry that you are around and ready to be taxed so feel free to drop by. you get to a major junction. there's a policeman there directing traffic. you patiently wait your turn, and when he directs you and you move. ah this isn't so bad you think. then you get to another junction and you let the cars with the right of way pass you "what are you doing?" "huh?" "my friend will you move?" "but mummy it isn't my turn" you hear the snort from the person she is currently gabbing with. by the time you get to your friend's house, all you want to do is curl up into a ball and rock back and forth. step 2: while at your friend's house, you decide to attend evening mass. you faintly recall that it was a short walk from their place. plus it's evening so it's nice outside. you proceed to walk expecting any moment to see the steeple. you climb up a hill. then you walk down another, artfully dodging okadas and wayward cars. can't these people see that you're a pedestrian you fume. finally, you get to church and say a small prayer of thanks that you convinced your friend to come get you after church. mass takes way longer than it used to. your friend has sent a text telling you he got tired of waiting outside so you should meet at the restaurant down the street. why me you cry in your heart as you wearily trudge to the spot, planning how you'll chop off his head if he even suggests that you just walk home. step 3: aaaah your friend's ac works. you sit back in the car and just enjoy the coolness of it while you reminisce about those bottles of real cold water you just downed. then you feel a rumble. you look around in shock thinking o lord are there earthquakes now in nigeria? then you realize its coming from your tummy. your mind flashes back to the orgasmic moi-moi and ogi you had for breakfast. your stomach rumbles again, and you wonder why your friend is suddenly driving so slowly. good god man drive damn you! as you struggle to hold it all in, it comes back to you that you only ever used to eat moi-moi or any other beans products in the evening and only if there was tons of bread available. as you finally sink onto the toilet seat and settle down with your book for a long visit, you think how this is a much more effective and better tasting alternative to the horrid chinese slimming tea you'd been on. hmmm… 
Male: 100%, Male, the new york times's city room blog included a friday piece on the orphaned web site of hiram monserrate, a former state senator who is again running for office. from "when not to accept comments:" now, as many will remember, the former queens legislator was tossed out of the state senate in february after he was convicted of assaulting his female companion. his vacant seat will be filled in a special election on march 16 — an election in which, improbably, the disgraced mr. monserrate is also a candidate, on the newly formed and hopefully (or is it cynically?) named yes we can! line. (this proves, definitively, that you can usually find more than enough new yorkers to take part in any crazy idea you have.) candidate monserrate (yes we can, queens) doesn’t have a web site for this campaign. but a few disgruntled residents found his old site and left some less-than-friendly messages. conveniently left unmentioned is the party to which monserrate claimed allegiance as recently as last month. as reported in the new york times on february 9, 2010: the state senate on tuesday expelled a senator convicted of domestic assault, the first time in nearly a century that the legislature has forced a member from office. the senate voted 53-to-8 to immediately oust the senator, hiram monserrate, a queens democrat convicted last fall of a misdemeanor for dragging his companion down the hallway of his apartment building. amazing, isn't it, how quickly party affiliation is overlooked when the perp is a democrat? and yet, as documented repeatedly here on newsbusters, quite predictable. read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/mike-bates/2010/03/07/name-part-domestic-assault-edition#ixzz0ipmr6bnh 
Male: 100%, Male, many people (including myself) have come to the conclusion that gmail, with its threaded messages, spam filtering, and vast storage space, is one of the web’s best webmail providers. in fact, we like it so much that we use it for both our personal accounts and work accounts using google apps. but that also poses a problem: many of us wind up having to maintain two separate google accounts, which means we have to swap logins whenever our gmail, reader, or other data is stored under the other account. fortunately, there may be an end in sight for this juggling act. as today’s sxsw panel on gmail came to a close, the panelists revealed one last juicy tidbit: they’re working to resolve the problems with multiple namespaces that users have to deal with. the team didn’t get specific — they simply repeated that they have to deal with the same problems, as they have “@google.com” accounts for work and standard gmail accounts for personal use. and they know it’s a pain. there’s no time frame, and we have no idea what form the feature will take. but at least we know google is working on it.
Female: 100%, Female, sorry for the lack of posts. i've been doing more stuff on facebook these days then updating my blog (sorry)! so if you're on there, send me a friend request i'm on there as aimee olson and i'll add you (if i know you)... lol all is well at our house. we made it through the holiday's but started off the new year a little rocky. we thought that the little jetta that could had finally went to its final resting place. however, she was able to be resurrected. i'm pretty happy as i love driving her to work! so then, our gmc got wrecked suckin' crap! it doesn't have a lot of cosmetic damage but the young man that hit kyle, hit the truck in a really bad spot so it goes into the shop this week so we'll wait and see what they have to say. i'll keep you all posted! our work is just plugging along for both of us. i applied for a new job with the state but we're on a hiring freeze right now so we'll wait and see what happens. i'll be happy if a i get it but i'm also content where i'm at right now. it's a win win situation for me either way. ok... don't have a lot of time this morning so i'll share a few new pics. hope all is well with everyone. loves.... 
Male: 100%, Male, did you watch any of the health-care summit yesterday in washington? guess what? the republicans and democrats are divided and likely can't find any common ground. all the morning press reports suggest that the democrats may now use the parliamentary procedure known as "reconciliation" to pass a health-care bill with a simple majority and without any republicans. rather than just repeat the arguments i've made repeatedly about the critical need for health-care reform in this country, and to include the tens of millions who are currently without health insurance (and sounding like a democrat to some of you), let's get theological. republicans, of course, have also used reconciliation before to pass measures they wanted--like the bush tax cuts. so, let's look at that theologically. first, the tax cuts that george bush pushed through congress overwhelmingly benefited the richest people in america--virtually all analysts agree with that fact. but many americans haven't really calculated that the cost of those tax cuts for the rich was literally double what health-care reform is projected to cost. double. yet, there was not even a mention from republicans, then or now, about the fiscal cost of such enormous tax cuts for the wealthiest people in america. and now they are doing everything they can to stoke public outrage about the cost of health-care reform (even though the congressional budget office says the president's proposal will likely reduce the deficit by $100 billion over the next decade). how does that square with the biblical emphasis on the priority of the poor? there is simply no way to justify the habitual behavior of the current republican party's clear preference for the rich over everybody else. probably my best friend in the congress was republican senator mark hatfield. the current republican party is a very different one than it was in hatfield's time. i know he would not have liked the "theology" of his party today. second, the largest single government discretionary expense is for the military, for fighting wars. military spending is also, historically, the most wasteful form of government spending with cost overruns, fiscal abuse, political corruption, and shameful pork barrel interests all part of standard operating procedures. so why is there a continual refusal from republicans to apply their concerns about waste, fraud, and abuse about government expenditures to those expenditures? how does that square with the biblical call to peacemaking and the christian doctrine that is, at least, suspicious of war as the answer to the problems of human conflict, which should either be outright rejected or very reluctantly accepted as an absolute last resort? there is simply no possible biblical mandate for giving the military a blank check as the current republicans almost always do now. again, this would have been bad theology for the evangelical mark hatfield, who courageously opposed the war in vietnam.
Male: 100%, Male, cnn went into full tilt in promoting its upcoming pro-gender "reassignment" documentary "her name was steven" with anderson cooper's interview of chastity "chaz" bono, the daughter of sonny bono and cher, on his ac360 program on thursday. cooper very sympathetically interviewed bono, and threw softball questions, even going so far as to ask, "how do you like shaving?" the anchor heralded the "extraordinary transformation" of his guest at the top of the 10 pm eastern hour, and noted that "in a rare interview, he [bono] talks about life as a man and the journey he's still undergoing." prior to the first segment of the interview at the bottom of the hour, cooper aired a report from cnn's gary tuchman on "how chastity became chaz." the correspondent confused the english language to the point of referring to bono with a male possessive pronoun at the beginning of a sentence, and then referring bono as "she" within the same breath. story continues below ad ↓ tuchman's report featured three sound bites from people magazine's mike fleeman, who also contributed to the confusion by referring to "he" [bono] having a procedure normally associated with women: tuchman (voice-over): today, his name is chaz bono, but back then, she was chastity bono: not just her parents' sweetheart, but an american sweetheart.... fleeman: chaz has given very little specific information about the actual procedure. we know that he's had a mastectomy. we know that he's been taking the proper hormones, know that he had a hysterectomy for unrelated reasons in the past, know that he's living completely as a man, know that he started shaving for the first time. read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/matthew-balan/2010/03/12/cnns-cooper-interviews-chaz-bono-part-pro-transgender-publicity#ixzz0ipsezvmq 
Male: 100%, Male, at this time of year, the sun does not rise at all this far north of the arctic circle. but karen margrethe kuvaas says she has not been able to sleep well for days. what is keeping her awake are the far-reaching ripple effects of the troubled housing market in sunny florida, california and other parts of the united states. ms. kuvaas is the mayor of narvik, a remote seaport where the season’s perpetual gloom deepened even further in recent days after news that the town — along with three other norwegian municipalities — had lost about $64 million, and potentially much more, in complex securities investments that went sour. “i think about it every minute,” ms. kuvaas, 60, said in an interview, her manner polite but harried. “because of this, we can’t focus on things that matter, like schools or care for the elderly.” norway’s unlucky towns are the latest victims — and perhaps the least likely ones so far — of the credit crisis that began last summer in the american subprime mortgage market and has spread to the farthest reaches of the world, causing untold losses and sowing fears about the global economy. where all the bad debt ended up remains something of a mystery, but to those hit by the collateral damage, it hardly matters. 
Male: 100%, Male, howell raines lost his executive editor’s job at the new york times for promoting the career of jayson blair, a black drug addict and fantasist who invented entire stories describing the hills of west virginia from a saloon down the street in new york. but somehow raines still imagines himself a media bigfoot who can pronounce on the state of journalism, a one-man pulitzer prize panel. this is a little like a white house chef who poisoned an entire state-dinner crowd mounting a soapbox to lecture that the new chefs can’t be trusted. of course, that soapbox must be provided first. so who would give this naked man a fig leaf of respectability? the washington post would. the posties awarded raines their marquee venue – the sunday outlook section -- to denounce fox news channel and its owner rupert murdoch. announcing this was tugging at his "professional conscience" (thus suggesting he has one), raines demanded to know "why can't american journalists steeped in the traditional values of their profession be loud and candid about the fact that murdoch does not belong to our team?" read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/brent-bozell/2010/03/16/bozell-column-fraud-fights-fox-news#ixzz0ipjt7cdm 
Male: 100%, Female, for some, sales is arguably the hardest job in the world. for others, however, the adrenalin of the roller coaster ride that is the sales process, keeps most on the edge of their seat for their entire careers. the real question are however, do businesses truly recognize and properly rate the critical importance of their sales people; and, do businesses ensure that their sales people are skilled and motivated enough to sell in a more than ordinary fashion? it's hard to find any businesses in the world who don't have something to sell and don't want to make money and succeed. it doesn't matter whether the company is selling services or products, if they don't have sales people who "feed" the business, the business won't exist. so, as most can imagine, motivating, training and energizing the salesforce should be as critical to a business as advertising and promotion. without a strong sales force them, businesses can't close a sale and book revenue. with that said, here are some tips to help motivate and empower a collective salesforce. give your team the power of positive feedback. executives are fooling themselves if they think a sales force will work forever on financial motivation alone, but that's simply not true. most sales people are a personality type that requires feedback. they emotionally connect with their customers, peers and networks, constantly seeking approval, satisfaction and achievement. the business owner or manager’s role is to support and reinforce the efforts of a motivated sales person. without realizing it, a manager can drain the motivation right out of a team. a manager can strip away motivation them by creating a stressful, negative work environment. guide and support them in building their own approach many people "fall" into sales as a career, finding themselves to be good at it early on. as they improve their techniques and confidence, they gradually work their way higher and higher up the food chain of a business until they reach the ceiling and seek entrepreneurial opportunity. 
Male: 100%, Male, perfectly timed for the week president barack obama is pushing the house to vote on obamacare, on tonight’s (tuesday) episode of cbs’s the good wife, set at a chicago law firm, the lawyers “battle a health insurance company that refuses to pay for urgent in-utero surgery.” the cbs.com plug for the march 16 episode: “in an emergency courtroom set up in a hospital, alicia and will battle patti nyholm and an insurance company that refuses to pay for life-saving in-utero surgery.” the last time i critiqued the good wife (“cbs drama showcases blank book that mocks palin as empty-headed dunce”), newsreal blog’s david forsmark contended the program “is both politically and (more importantly) dramatically complex” and deserves credit for showcasing liberal hypocrisy. so, i’ll hold out hope this episode will deliver more than just simplistic vilification of an insurance company and might, given the plot involves “in-utero surgery,” also forward pro-life perspectives. watch and see. read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/brent-baker/2010/03/16/prime-time-cbs-drama-target-health-insurance-company#ixzz0ipo585ao 
Female: 100%, Male, halloween was so fun. camden was wolverine, aj was a witch, dilyn was a skeleton, and austin and me went as the beauty and the beast. guess who was who? lol. we started out going to bri's where she made the most amazing assortment of soups and the cutes little bread soup bowls that looked like pumpkins. don and vicci and maretta and madison. it was a lot of fun. we did a bit of trick or treating with bridger, and madison and then we went up to our neighborhood and went around the block, camden and aj about two houses were needing to go potty but they didn't want to leave their goal of getting candy so they did the potty dance as they waited at each door! haha! i tried to get a video on my phone but it was getting too dark and the people always opened the door right before i got it going... but it was dang funny! after we got home i hurried and got the kids bathed and camden asked to hand out candy i think he was more excited about handing out candy than going to get candy! camden would go look out the blinds and start hollering that the kids were coming then he'd run and grab the candy bowl and stand in front of the door.... after about 5 seconds he would set the bowl down and run back to the blinds and peek out to see where the kids were at.... then run back to the door stand infront of the front door and again wait till they did the door bell! it was quite entertaining! at one point we got some "bigger kids" and aj looks at them and says your a "big kid" haha! the boys started laughing and he said "yup" it was a good night and lots of fun!
Male: 100%, Male, california dreamin turned out to be another california nightmare for elliott sadler and his 19 team. the buzz words were already flowing in pre-race and qualifying quotes, almost in an eerie foreshadowing of the sunday to come.“we have a lot of effort put into our front clips, front geometry, trying to get the front tires to work as efficient as we can. some owners may be thinking its body, motors, rear clips, center cage….there are many things that you can work on. right now we’re really working on our front clips area, bump stop and front geometry stuff. as a team, we think that’s where we need to be better. right now, that’s where the emphasis has been with winter testing so far.”listening via the greatness of pitcommand, it was pretty clear from the start that sadler was not happy but it goes further than that.lap 5 caution (rain)sadler after five (really 4) short laps tells cc kevin buskirk that there is a problem with the front end by announcing that the 19 car is ‘a little snug in the middle and a little snug back in the gas….and that the splitter seemed to be dragging a bit’, in the corners. after a small exchange that the 19 team finally figured out that the radios used need the ‘big antenna’ in order for sadler to hear them (maybe the best buy geek squad should assist) another ‘track position’ pit strategy move instead of making an honest attempt to ‘fix’ an ill handling car, 2 tires and a half pound out of the right rear was the pit call. the 19 entered the pits running 25th, and took the green flag running 21st.side note: this caution lasted over 15 laps and it was during this caution that sadler was asking for the dreaded trackbar change in order to give him some more ‘forward bite’. since the last pit stop, no green flag laps had been run, and sadler is already ‘complaining’ about the car. not that there is anything wrong with this, except for the ‘strategy’ 2 tire stop laps before. why not simply make the changes, take four tires, lose a few positions , in the name of making the car better in he long run? but i have been a broken record about this for almost a decade.lap 35 scanner chat:sadler tells buskirk that the 19 is ‘still dragging the splitter on entry’, and is a ‘little free off’. the 19 car is running 26th at this time.lap 41 caution (rain): sadler reinforces that the ‘splitter is still dragging too much on entry’ he goes a bit more in depth for his cc with ‘front end is trying to work, its better than yesterday.’ and lastly again states he wants ‘a little more forward bite on exit’. buskirk quickly and commandly tells the 19 team to go up on all 4 tire pressures and to add a ‘packer’. (not sure which tire the bump stop was added to though). sadler added that he didn’t think it would need much, maybe a ‘1/16th’, not much more. the 19 enter the pits running 27th, and took the field running 39th. it was then decided after a nice suggestion by brett griffin that it might be a good idea to ‘top off’ because there were only two cars running behind the 19. after topping off, the 19 takes the green flag running 40th. 
Female: 100%, Female, sorry for taking so long to write properly but i literally haven't had a spare minute to do anything these last few weeks. advance warning that this is likely to be a very long post so i can tell you everything thats been going on. i really miss it when i dont get time to blog and i find my mood starts to go down hill when i'm bottling things up that i can't get out of my system via a good old blog post,silly but true. right, so first news i suppose is that i am now writing for two blogs! yes the woman who can't keep one blog up to date is now writing 2! the reason i'm doing this is because i have been made a patient ambassador for the transplant charity live life then give life. along with my lovely friend rachael wakefield , we will be telling our stories, helping people put a face to the transplant statistics and writing a blog about life waiting for transplant (you can read the blog here or via the link in the right hand column). i'm really honoured to have been asked to do this and will do my best to keep people thinking about organ donation. another piece of good news is that i'm doing realy well on my open university course. the last two essays i have written were some of the hardest i've encountered and no one could have been more suprised than i was when i recieved an a grade for both of them!!! the first a grades i've recieved on any of my ou courses. it really has made all the hard work worthwhile but more than that its made me feel valuable and like i've achieved something. as i have said over on the ambassador blog, studying is something that has nothing to do with illness but is the one thing that remains just for me. to do well on it makes me unbelievably satisfied and happy. the course has done more for me than just cheer me up, it has made me seriously consider what i want to do study wise. i have enjoyed this literature based course more than any of the others i have done and am so far doing well on it. it is making me think about changing my degree subject to a ba in literature. this would mean me doing a few more courses but i really think deep down this could be right for me. i know it sounds completely mad to change this late in the day! (and very unlike me) but i have to compromise on so many things why should i not take a leap of faith here? a literature degree would make more sense for any acting dreams i have and if i find the work more enjoyable then i think its worth it. i'm still yet to decide properly but its something i'm very seriously considering. on the not so good side i have been finding myself struggling more lately. i have reached the point in my course where i'm kept very busy and there is a lot riding on these last few months/essays. i am also struggling more with my health. i had a good clinic visit at the end of january but for months now i have been getting more breathless/exhausted with trivial things. last month i had my oxygen levels checked to see if i required more oxygen to make my life easier. everything is coming back as stable, my lung function is stable, oxygen is ok, blood tests showed my infection markers are fine, all definate positives......but i still feel awful on a day to day basis. it sounds awful but i almost feel as though i'm hovering in an area in between 'ill enough to do something and ok enough that theres nothing that will make a difference' and to be honest i'd rather be one or the other. its been over 2 and a half years since i went on the list and while i expect things to have declined, it is very very hard to feel you need help and support but not to recieve it. over the last few weeks i have become very wheezy and my chest often feels very uncomfortable. my treatment regieme barely leaves me any time to study and i feel like what i want to do has to take a back seat. its like the cf is getting bigger and i'm getting smaller. i'm determined to finish my course and to do it to the very best of my ability but when i am constantly doing meds or feeling ill it is becoming almost impossible (see here). things like my blog, keeping in touch with friends etc are falling down my list and i'm struggling to keep my head above water at the moment. that said, i will keep going until things get easier. i will do as much as i can even in the small snatches of time that i get away from treatments. i will keep on because of how lucky i am to still be here and because i will not let cf take away something else i hold so dear to me. i want this transplant so badly now, this life at the moment is making me appreciate how good things are going to become one day. there are so many things right now that i have to push to the back of my mind because i can't do them and to think about them physically hurts me. i miss so many aspects of the life i haven't even been able to begin yet. if i'm not around much lately you will now know why, i'm still here (even if a little worse for wear) and i'm keeping on, the only way i know how.
Male: 100%, Male, when valve confirmed mac support for steam last week, i emailed the joystiq team with the following claim: "this is arguably the biggest gaming news on mac os ever." it seems valve shares the sentiment, as the company's john cook – director of steam development at valve – calls it "the biggest event in steam's history." he also answered some more of our questions via email, so read on! joystiq: just to clarify, steam users with games already purchased on windows and that have mac versions available will have those mac versions accessible to them immediately in steam, for no extra charge? john cook: this is supported by "steam play." we are using this feature to provide cross-platform access to all valve games to those who already own the pc version. we hope other developers and publishers will use it in the same way. some blogs have reported that valve "hates the mac" – from gabe: "so, they seem to think that they want to do gaming, but there's never any follow through on any of the things they say they're going to do. that makes it hard to be excited about doing games for their platforms." so, as a followup, was apple involved in this endeavor at all? did they provide any programming resources or platform-level assistance? first, the statement that gabe hates the mac is erroneous. in fact, he worked on a 6mhz lisa running a mac emulator in his first post-college job and is involved in the current mac work on a daily basis. as for apple, yes -- we've been working with them on this project and we're looking forward to expanding that relationship as we launch steam for the mac.
Male: 100%, Male, on tuesday's situation room, cnn's jack cafferty returned to targeting nancy pelosi, this time for endorsing the controversial "slaughter solution" to passing obamacare through the house of representatives without a vote. cafferty labeled the proposal "beyond sleazy," and later flatly remarked, "this reeks!" the commentator even gave some rare kudos to house republicans [audio clips from the segment available here]. cafferty devoted his 5 pm eastern hour commentary to pelosi's support for the "deem and pass" procedural maneuver that democratic representative louise slaughter submitted as a possible way of getting the senate version of health care "reform" passed through the house. he wasted little time in expressing his amazement at the move: "just when you think you've seen it all in washington, along comes something like this. house speaker nancy pelosi may try to pass the controversial health care reform bill without making members vote on it- simply unbelievable." story continues below ad ↓ later, after using his "beyond sleazy" label, cafferty ripped into the house speaker and her democratic colleagues, and commended their republican opponents for speaking out against the so-called slaughter solution: "pelosi says of this process- quote, 'i like it, because people don't have to vote on the senate bill,' unquote. in nancy pelosi's world, accountability is a dirty word....this tactic has been used in the past, but never- never for something as big and important as the $900 billion health care reform bill- never. republicans are jumping all over this, rightfully so. they're painting it as a way for democrats to avoid taking responsibility, which is exactly what it is. some even suggest it's unconstitutional." near the end of the segment, anchor wolf blitzer remarked, "we're earning a lot about reconciliation, about 'deeming' bills passed into law. we're getting a little civics lesson out there, aren't we, jack?" the cnn commentator replied, "we're learning a lot more about lack of political guts." when blitzer retorted that "that's been around for a while," cafferty bluntly replied, "not quite in this obnoxious form or noxious form. this reeks!" read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/matthew-balan/2010/03/16/jack-cafferty-pelosi-beyond-sleazy-endorsing-slaughter-solution#ixzz0iprluz3n 
Male: 100%, Male, taylor harris, a black university of virginia graduate now studying writing at johns hopkins, had an excellent article (“racial pawns in the battle for same-sex marriage”) in the washington post recently. “all too often,” she begins, white liberal classmates at the university of virginia would ask, “shouldn’t blacks, more than any other group, support gay rights?” she continues: i never understood my classmates’ need to align the historical struggles of blacks with those of homosexuals and then push their quadratic equation of oppression on me. was not one point of ralph ellison’s invisible man, a classic text for college seminars, that blacks deserve an existence free from an assigned role? that they should not be pawns in any social movement? and even if they hadn’t read the book, wasn’t it clear that stereotypical assumptions based on race are regressive? on that last point, it’s certainly not clear to everyone. what would there be to “diversity,” after all, without the assumption that blacks are one and all “different” enough to provide it to others? for the purposes of “diversity,” in short, blacks are fungible: because they are all “different,” they are all the same. but let’s leave “diversity” aside for now and return to the issue of blacks and gays. “hearing that from my white peers was one thing,” ms. harris continued, [b]ut last month, one of our greatest civil rights leaders also sang the same cacophonous tune in an attempt to peg african americans’ morals and opinions to our socio-historical identities.
Male: 100%, Male, joe sheehan over at basketball prospectus is back aboard a favorite old hobbyhorse of his — the ncaa selection committee's habit of matching up non-bcs schools in the first round — and damned if he doesn't have a point. this year, we have unlv-northern iowa, butler-utep, richmond-st. mary's, temple-cornell. that's not an inordinate number of mid-major vs. mid-major pairings; if you were to randomly generate a bracket, as kevin pelton did, you'd get four or five such games. but here's sheehan: the thing is, it's *not* a random process. they're sitting down, doing a bracket and shoving these teams together, while also giving us cal/louisville and clemson/missouri. i stand by the idea that this is intentional, and has increased since the wichita state/george mason regional semi in '06. they simply don't want more than one, maybe two widely spaced cinderellas getting to that second weekend. running at this from a different direction, follow the money. conferences get shares based on how far their teams advance in the tournament. it's best for the dominant conferences if the smaller ones are capped in how many shares they can get. [...] it's bad for the tournament and for the game. cornell, utep, st. mary's, uni...these teams can't get games against bcs schools in the regular season short of playing at their place, and sometimes not even then. the tournament should provide some of that opportunity, and it's aggressively not doing so, essentially protecting the scheduling practices of bcs schools by not potentially exposing them to quality lower-conference teams in the tournament. there's a case to be made that just about any first-round matchup of mid-major teams is both somewhere south of ideal — fans don't want cinderella vs. cinderella — and easily avoided. that the selection committee feels otherwise, sheehan argues, isn't so much a wicked conspiracy as it is the inevitably perverted outcome of letting people with skin in the game decide who gets to play whom and when. i'll buy that. for all the talk of "peeling the onion" and all the ludicrously pained efforts at objectivity (a reliance on that worthless bit of bottom-dealing known as the rpi, for instance), the selection process is in reality little more than an exercise in looking at the big blinking neon arrows all around you and doing exactly as they say.
Male: 100%, Male, back during the 2008 presidential campaign, then-sen. joe biden, the democratic nominee for vice president said it was "patriotic" for people to pay more taxes, in an interview on abc's "good morning america." but what if you don't have to pay more taxes legally? biden's reasoning was simplistic - that we all need to "jump in, time to be part of the deal, time to help get america out of the rut." but according to cnbc's jim cramer, based on legal precedence, the internal revenue service encourages people to pay as little tax as possible, as long as it is within the boundaries of the seemingly endless u.s. tax code. "the government has made it very clear in a series of tax rulings since the income tax started - and i learned this at law school - that it is actually well within your patriotic right to try and pay as little tax legally," cramer said on cnbc's march 12 "street signs." "see, tax avoidance is actually part of the irs - says listen tax avoidance, you can do it. tax evasion is against the law. tax avoidance, the irs has always said listen you have every right to try and have tax avoidance. and believe me, i'm going to take advantage of it." read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/jeff-poor/2010/03/12/biden-debunked-cramer-declares-avoiding-taxes-patriotic-duty#ixzz0iplll5fx 
Female: 100%, Female,  firstly, i get to go on tour with my brother again. we're biking across bc and to the west coast. woot woot! and i was just talking to both my brothers over the phone, so that's made me even more excited. secondly, i don't have to be in school anymore! and i get to be active all day!!!! yes!!!! i mean, i love love love physics 30, it's the most amazing course i've taken so far in my life and i would definitely go to university to get into noetic science and atomic physics and all that jazzzzzz. but that would mean that i would have to get high school diploma...and i'm too bored with school to do that. why go through everyone else's motions when i can just take my own path? i'll learn just as much this way. and if i have my way about it, i'll be talking to plenty of people who know about science in my lifetime. for the simple reason that i'm manifesting it. so. thirdly...it's freaking summer. who isn't excited about it?? =p and in the next couple of years i'm hoping to be on the other land mass, touring around europe and africa and asia and australia and, this is the one i want to go to most, the middle east!!!!!!!!!!! i'm soooo excited to go to israel and afghanistan and india and syria and lebanon and turkey!!!! especially turkey. however, i'm feeling productive, so i believe i shall go sew something. peace and love, my dear friends!!!
Female: 99%, Male, who would have ever thought that "a bike" would bring me onto such a positive & life changing path? on 01 january 1994, i realized that there was more to life than: guzzling an expensive bottle of robert mondavi chardonnay, being the belle of the ball, speaking of what others need to work on, and/or sitting daily on the same coach (in self pity). so, i bought a 10 year old bianchi road bike. and i began a 6-month intense cycling training for a cycling event called the california aids ride #2. in may of 1994, i left san francisco with $3.00 in my pocket, no idea of how i was going to return, a questionable bike, the fear of failure, and began to cycle (along with 1500 other cyclist) toward west hollywood. seven days, 575 miles later, i arrived in west hollywood. at which point, i realized it is possible to step outside of your normal routine. i realized it is possible to empower yourself while assisting others. i realized that i wasn't alone in my ideas of creating a better world. and i realized that miracles could occur (after all, i made it back home with $3.00 in my pocket).
Male: 100%, Male, facebook’s f8 conference is shaping up to have quite a few improvements in store for developers, and we think we’ve come across another one: a change to facebook’s data retention policy. yesterday, facebook employee monica keller (who left myspace to join the company last month), took part in a conversation on twitter that seemed to indicate that developers may no longer have to delete user data. the possible change came to light after gnip ceo eric marcoullier gently chided keller about developers being unable to store any user data, to which she responded, “come to f8!”. since that tweet, we’ve heard further whispers about a change to facebook’s 24 hour policy retention, and that facebook is already briefing developers on the upcoming changes.
Male: 100%, Male, britain's small businesses are being offered free domain names and website hosting in a bid to get every plumber, window cleaner and green-grocer online. up to 1.5 million of the uk's sole traders and micro-business owners don't have a web presence at the moment. the british government wants to do something about this, and they've teamed up with google and bt to solve what they perceive to be a problem. the result is an initiative called getting british business online which has the bold ambition of getting 100,000 commercial websites running by the end of 2010. the core of the program is the gbbo 'wizard' that makes it easy for a business owner to create a site in about 15 minutes. there are plans for paypal to add an e-commerce platform in the next couple of months. subscribers to this free service get their own choice of a .co.uk domain name and two years of free hosting. the pages are built with google sites, while bt offers free telephone support to allow users to "create an effective online presence." in addition, the uk has launched a qualification called, itq for doing business online, which is aimed at helping businesses get the most from their website, thus allowing them to become more competitive. according to the uk secretary of state for business, lord mandelson: "encouraging more businesses to seize the opportunities the internet offers is particularly important now that the economy is growing again." it remains to be seen whether britain's army of offline entrepreneurs are tempted to start promoting their wares online through this offer of a free website. 
Male: 100%, Male, email messages obtained by the competitive enterprise institute via a freedom of information act request reveal that the climate dataset of nasa’s goddard institute for space studies (giss) was considered — by the top climate scientists within nasa itself — to be inferior to the data maintained by the university of east anglia climate research unit (cru). the nasa scientists also felt that nasa giss data was inferior to the national climate data center global historical climate network (ncdc ghcn) database. these emails, obtained by christopher horner, also show that the nasa giss dataset was not independent of cru data. further, all of this information regarding the accuracy and independence of nasa giss data was directly communicated to a reporter from usa today in august 2007. the reporter never published it. ————————————— 
Male: 100%, Male, when sen. evan bayh of indiana announced last week he wasn’t running for re-election, he didn’t state what may have seemed obvious. he couldn’t say he wanted to avoid the embarrassment of losing, or that he worried he’d never achieve national office if that happened. instead, he launched into a lecture about what was wrong with everyone else. the government is "dysfunctional" with "brain-dead partisanship." it’s "groundhog day." this scenario repeats itself every time the democrats take control. bayh’s bleats hardened quickly into the media’s conventional wisdom. why can’t the politicians hold hands in a kumbaya circle and get "something" done? translation: when obama and a democrat-dominated congress can’t nationalize the health-care system and force everyone to drive a prius, suddenly government is "dysfunctional." when gridlock is holding up the liberals’ agenda, washington should know "the people" sent them to pass massive ultraliberal bills. story continues below ad ↓ these media mathematicians clearly have thrown their polling calculators out the window. when newsweek recently asked independents if they supported the democrat health proposals, 26 percent were in favor, and 62 percent were opposed. but the "wisdom" in town says democrats must pass these health bills or get crushed in november. now who can’t seem to acknowledge, to borrow from stephen colbert, that "reality has a conservative bias"? reality tells you many democrats are political toast, thanks to obamacare. hence, bye-bye bayh. but our journalists put on their choir robes and continue to sing the sad song in unison: why do we have a "broken government"? cnn actually launched an entire series of reports with that title. read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/brent-bozell/2010/02/23/bozell-column-broken-government-when-liberals-lose#ixzz0ipkl7ltc 
Female: 98%, Female, if you are looking for a fun way to keep busy, the coming weekend will be a busy and exciting one in the adirondack north country. on saturday, the best alpine skiers in the united states will be racing at whiteface competing for the national title. from march 20-23, whiteface mountain in wilmington, new york, will once again host the visa u.s. alpine championships. naturally, a number of olympians fresh in from the vancouver olympic games, including u.s. olympic gold medalist lindsey vonn, u.s. silver medalist julia mancuso, u.s. bronze medalist andrew weibrecht, and u.s. olympians ted ligety and steve nyman will be racing at our own olympic mountain. back in the village of lake placid, ice hockey will be the cold weather sport of choice when the village hosts the 2010 ncaa division iii men's ice hockey national championships. the first playoff puck will be dropped on friday, march 19. not to be forgotten and one of my favorite ways to keep busy is indulging in the incredible spring skiing. we received another 10 inches of snow the night before last and the skiing has been superb. in my book, backcountry skiing luscious corn snow in 50-degree brilliant sunshine is one of the most fun and rejuvenating activities around. the adirondacks have it all; the excitement and buzz of watching a top-level competition or participating in private ski excursion at your own quiet ski resort in the woods. all you have to do is choose. today's featured photo shows the lake placid 1932 olympic arena, on main street, courtesy of joann sandone reed. today's brilliant blue sky, visible in the photo, and warm sunshine, made today's skiing obligation a delight.
Male: 100%, Male, maybe thomson reuters was feeling nostalgic about the flurry of negative attention that both the new york times and the washington post got last year when they came out with policies on the use of social media tools such as twitter and facebook. for whatever reason, the wire service recently issued new guidelines for its staff, and they suffer from many of the same problems that both the nyt and wapo policies did. all of these flaws boil down to one thing: a desire to control something that fundamentally can’t be controlled, and a fear of what happens when that control is lost. without even bothering to enumerate the positive aspects of social media use, the policy starts in with the warnings right away: we want to encourage you to use social media approaches in your journalism but we also need to make sure that you are fully aware of the risks — especially those that threaten our hard-earned reputation for independence and freedom from bias or our brand. the risks, of course, are everywhere — someone might say something embarrassing, or post a tweet that others could twist to disparage reuters: the advent of social media does not change your relationship with the company that employs you — do not use social media to embarrass or disparage thomson reuters. our company’s brands are important; so, too, is your personal brand. think carefully about how what you do reflects upon you as a professional and upon us as an employer of professionals.
Male: 100%, Male, recently presidential special advisor david axelrod has been painted as a beleaguered figure, upset at the world he sees around him. today he told the republicans to "make my day" and the israelis a new policy announcement was an "insult." axelrod and white house press secretary robert gibbs were doing the rounds on the sunday talk shows to talk about healthcare reform, among other topics. gibbs told fox news sunday that democrats would have enough votes to pass the bill in the next week or so and that soon we wouldn't be "talking about health care as a proposal, but as the law of the land." tom brokaw, on meet the press, asked david axelrod about the political cost of that reform for upcoming elections. axelrod leapt up on the table, and began savagely beating him (metaphorically): if the republican party wants to go out and say to that child who now has insurance or say to that small business that will get tax credits this year if he signs the bill to help their employees get health care. if they want to say to them, "you know what? we're actually gonna take that away from you. we don't think that's such a good idea." i say, let's have that fight. make my day. i'm ready to have that. and every member of congress ought to be willing to have that debate as well. enough ass-kicking work for one day? not for fuck-you-axelrod. israel have potentially torpedoed delicate negotiations with palestine by announcing a plan to build 1600 new homes in jerusalem. he told abc's this week that the move was both an "affront" and an "insult."
Male: 100%, Male, we see this when he demands of us the impossible. jesus told people to "go and sin no more." (jn. 5:14, 8:11) not, go and sin less. sin no more. impossible. "husbands, love your wives as christ loved the church." (eph. 5:25) "be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect." (matt. 5:48) god asks of us the impossible, we fail, we sin - we separate from god because we can't do the impossible. but god can. all things, it says in matthew 19 when speaking of salvation (something impossible for us to achieve on our own), are possible with god. the bible starts with this very thing: in the beginning god created. god was there when time began and created. how? by the impossible task of creation through speaking. i can't get my daughters to turn off the lights in their room with my words, but god said, "let there be light." and there was light! not just a 50w bulb here; there was light. from his voice! the psalmist says god breathed out stars and gathers the waters of the seas into jars. (ps. 33:6-7) and this is just the start. god is so big he deals in the realm of the impossible. and so it's no surprise that christmas is an impossible night. let's turn to john 1, starting in verse 10: he was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. he came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of god— children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of god. the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. we have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only, who came from the father, full of grace and truth. impossibly, god the creator entered into his creation at christmas (well, technically, at jesus' conception.) the world was made through him (jesus), and he became flesh and made his dwelling among us. as our pastor, jason, reminded us this morning [12/20 sermon], god did not just drop in for a visit. he was born into our world. he became one of us. god became a man: impossible. he was born to a virgin. impossible. he came that we might be saved. impossible. impossible for man, but with god all things are possible. angels appeared to shepherds. angels appeared to mary & joseph. sages from far away read jesus' birth in the stars. the creator god of the universe who is big enough to breathe out stars became a baby, wrapped in laid in the humblest of mangers. proclaimed by angels, worshipped by shepherds and foreigners - jesus entered his creation, became immanuel: god with us. he made it possible for us to become born again, something which again is impossible - without god. a little baby displayed the glory of god. the smallest of infants demonstrated, through his impossible birth and through the bigness of who this baby was, the immensity of god's grace, his mercy, his love. this is why christmas is a reason to worship, to celebrate, to be in awe of this great big god who came for us who deals in the (what is for us) impossible in impossible ways – that’s the message of christmas and it’s what we rejoice in at christmas.
Male: 100%, Female, many people i meet as a marketer ask me how quickly their marketing will lead to sales and ultimately, revenue. i reply by asking them what their time to sale is and what their level of awareness is within their target markets? i also like to understand how many happy customers or clients they have created over time. occasionally i get some puzzled looks. whenever i do, i offer this simple marketing lesson. have you ever heard of the principle that one satisfied customer can bring you up to 10 more customers in a shorter amount of time than you can build them all by yourself? well, let me show you why: there is five stages to building a customer from no-awareness to full blown evangelist. get it right and you'll only have to go through the initial campaigns once or twice to build the initial base of satisfied customers extolling your virtues. this is the foundation i build many marketing campaigns on, ensuring i have strategies to take a potential customer on the journey through each stage. awareness: you must make a customer aware of your product or service category, your business and its capability. at this point of the process, lets face it, many potential targets are largely disinterested or indifferent as they can't see a need for your product or service in their life much of the time. this step is a hard, often cold part of the sales process, full of apathy and rejection. interest: something happens in a potential target's life or business for them to move from basic awareness phase and raise their interest in your offering. a target cannot get to interest if you haven't raised awareness of your brand and offering or capability with them — except through step five: satisfaction. this is the point of a process where we would qualify a target as a warm lead and nurture them carefully to build their interest into hungry desire. 
Male: 100%, Male, it's been something of a long road to this point (beginning with the company being founded by some laid off openmoko employees), but qi hardware's ultra-compact, open source ben nanonote (actually, 本 nanonote) is now shipping for just $99. that will get you a bare bones device that can simply be used as a linux-based "handheld laptop" out of the box or, as the company hopes, be turned into anything from a pmp to an offline wikipedia device. something along those lines would seem to be the most practical, considering the device only has a 3-inch 320 x 240 display, along with some similarly basic specs including a 336 mhz xburst jz4720 cpu, 32mb of ram, 2gb of flash storage, and a microsd card slot for expansion. head on past the break for a look under the lid.
Male: 100%, Male, some days later, alessandro shared this interesting post about the several versions of flash available on android.it's now clear that a new flash lite is coming 'soon'. what is it (apart to support as3, alleluia) ? for which platform ? available throught cs4 or cs5 like i reported previously, it's strange how adobe isn't sharing the information on flite 4.0...perhaps to avoid the confusion with fp10.1 ? i only hope one thing : to see fl4 (and fp10.1) working on android emulator! actually, apart an old s60 sdk which let you play fl1.1, i never found an emulator (nokia, se, android,...) able to play fl files and no, unfortunatly, the htc desire rom doesn't work on android emulator, since it's not for the right arm processor :(
Female: 100%, Female,  we're leaving one hot, dirty, sandstorm-riddled area in africa and are headed to a hot, dirty sandstorm riddled area in the gulf. why?? for the love of all that's holy why? you ask!? (as did i?) because (a) stupid sudan is having national elections soon and i am supposed to be here so i can pretend to care deeply about the "issues" facing sudan so i can't be gone long; and (b) josh is participating in a triathlon in abu dhabi. -- which is apparently why he insisted on hoggin the mail fairy so his "gear" could arrive and he could be prepared for his race and not die. i'm guessing i probably shouldn't have eaten his power bars...but seriously, who could have known! there should have been a sign. and finally (since i really don't have anything to say) i would just like to point out that we watched a movie this weekend (which i also realize you guys probably all saw like 6 months ago, but just be polite and pretend to listen) "the road" with that one guy who was in hidalgo and used to be soo dreamy until i found out that he likes to write poetry and commune with nature (that's not my way). did you guys see this?? the world is basically dying (i'm still not sure why, or what happened frankly) and that guy in hidalgo and his son try to go south and avoid cannibals (why are cannibals always depicted like they're from west virginia? and why do people from west virginia always manage to live when everyone else dies off...the inbred people seem to thrive in a catastrophe.....someone should really study that or something. learn their secret.) anyway, i'm not sure what happened, or why i watched that movie. all i know is that i am going to hoard some shoes (?? no, i'm not sure what happened to everyone's shoes frankly) and some canned fruit cocktail. don't ask questions.....trust me. just do it. you never know when something will happen that will make all the animals die and
Male: 100%, Male, with despair gripping new york democrats over ethical scandals claiming governor david patterson, rep. charlie rangel (d-ny), and rep. eric massa (d-ny), new york’s attorney general andrew cuomo cuts a heroic figure as the presumptive heir to the governorship. but catching up with cuomo is his relationship with the mortgage meltdown that nearly destroyed the american economy. appointed by bill clinton as secretary of the u.s. department for housing and urban development (hud), andrew cuomo has been called “the father of the subprime crisis” for the policies he orchestrated. it was cuomo’s directives that mandated hud to vastly increase the amount of risky home loans bought by quasi-governmental housing giants fannie mae and freddie mac. now, cuomo may be haunted by his tenure as hud secretary, where he planted the seeds for the nation’s housing collapse. though america’s financial fortunes suffered after cuomo’s time at hud, his own personal fortune soared. the bulk of this financial “windfall” came courtesy of andrew farkas, the billionaire real estate developer who helped cuomo amass his wealth as a business partner and campaign fundraiser. farkas — now cuomo’s financial chairman as he circles the governorship — has personally given cuomo at least $1.8 million in cash.
Female: 100%, Male, riginally posted this a couple weeks ago after the link was forwarded to me, but rewrote my thoughts after seeing it a few times. i'll still watch it again. a few times are not enough for me. each time you watch you'll see another inspiring moment. sometimes i just want to quit work and practice, so i can join the fun. (many of my best articles start with ideas from readers like you, so please keep sending me your thoughts!!!) this documentary is not new, but totally worth your time. it's interesting watching these young ballet dancers grow into flamenco dancers. the clapping exercises, the timing, and the process they go through are amazing. few of us could be that good without their background, but it's still worth checking out even if you're a casual dancer. it's very inspirational. they start so "simple" and build! the passion from the instructors is obvious. they clearly know the history and story behind the music and movements. they combine amazing technique with an understanding of the feel, providing depth behind the movements. you have to love the "circle" concept (around 26 minutes), where individuals take a turn dancing solo while everybody else provides the rhythm foundation and support. hip-hop dancers do this all the time, but obviously it's been around a few centuries before they were born. (as they say, little is truly new. most great artists build on the shoulders of the giants before them...) obviously this passion is way beyond what most of us will do social dancing. when you see the results from lots of hard work it may inspire you to work a little harder so you can join the fun too. great dance has it's moments of intense work. when it all comes together in the end it's a beautiful, inspiring, sensual experience.it's hard not to smile and feel good watching them perform. special thinks to valentine doran for turning me on to this clip. let me know what you think! more details:

Male: 100%, Male, in sports, everyone is a winner—some people just win better than others. like michael david barrett, erin andrews's peeper, who was sentenced yesterday to two-and-a-half years in prison and life as another triple-named american villain. maybe some j.d. out there (or, that failing, an espn.com commenter) can explain this to me. u.s. district judge manuel real said the 30 months was the maximum he could've imposed, though a quick glance at the federal sentencing table would suggest that barrett's term actually falls toward the low end. (stalking carries a base offense level of 18, i.e. 27-33 months, though the fact that barrett chased andrews all across the marriotts of america probably should've taken it up a couple of ticks). in any case, andrews is not pleased: "i'm at the angry stage right now," the espn reporter and upcoming contestant on abc's "dancing with the stars" said outside court. "i'm mad. thirty months is not enough." [...] she blasted barrett for claiming he should get leniency because he's paying for his guilty plea with public humiliation and spoke searingly in court about her own fear and suffering. "let's talk about public humiliation, mr. barrett," andrews said. "i'm living public humiliation. the picture on the internet is mine, it's not his."
Female: 100%, Female, jenni and i were driving in the car this afternoon when she began to tell me about a situation at her work. she was telling me about a fellow employee who was sent into the office to discuss some issues. she incredulously told me that his infraction was so bad that he had to talk to the (and i quote) "sbo". i replied, "do you mean ceo"? jenni: "oh yeah...what is a sbo?" me: "isn't that a student body officer?" jenni: "hahahahahahha! what is a ceo?" me: "chief executive officer". jenni: "oh, yeah that one" never a dull moment.
Male: 100%, Female, “the web is becoming a live medium — sales and auctions happen in time, product launches, chats with celebrities, live video events and audio, games, events in virtual worlds — there are a huge amount of scheduled things taking place,” says nova spivack, who recently sold off his semantic web search engine twine to evri. now he’s setting out to create a massive programming guide to those live online events, called live matrix. spivack last year brought on sanjay reddy, who’d done corporate development at gemstar-tv guide and led its sale to macrovision for $2.8 billion. reddy knew from experience that tv watchers spend 10 percent of their time watching tv on the interactive programming guide (per set-top box data). the web has much more going on at any one time, but nothing like an ipg. does that metaphor carry over? that’s what spivack, who’s serving as live matrix chairman, and reddy, the ceo, want to find out. they plan to launch in may and gave me a look at the pre-release site under the condition that i not release screenshots. i’ll tell you a bit more about what they’re doing and describe in words what it looks like. first of all, there’s the prototypical grid interface — though instead of listing channels due to preset numbers like on tv, they’re dynamically ordered based on demand. log in during march madness? that’s going to be on top. if a web metaphor is more your style, you can look at all the events in a digg-like interface. users can pull events into a personal playlist and receive reminders when they start. if you actually want to watch something, live matrix sends you to the host site rather than framing the content. 
Male: 100%, Male, cnn received two awards on march 13 from the gay & lesbian alliance against defamation (glaad) during its annual glaad media awards. the american morning program received the "outstanding tv journalism segment" award for an interview of a child who refuses to say the pledge of allegiance until homosexuals have "equal rights," while joy behar received their "excellence in media" award for her hln program. the homosexual activist organization's press release on the awards revealed that "cnn's american morning producer beth marengo and will phillips accepted for the outstanding tv journalism segment, 'why will won't pledge allegiance' which featured phillips and his father. in a rousing speech that elicited a standing ovation, 11-year-old phillips said: 'i know there are certain political restraints that make action difficult, however lack of equality for some is lack of equality for all and i think its time for us all to get equal.'" story continues below ad ↓ anchor john roberts interviewed phillips and his father on the november 16, 2009 edition of american morning. as newsbuster noel sheppard pointed out, the two were given much better treatment than tea party protesters were given earlier in 2009. behar received her "excellence" award from nbc today show anchor meredith vieira. the glaad press released trumpeted how the hln host "has shown a strong commitment to educating the public about the lives of gay and transgender people." the tvnewser blog on march 14 reported behar's beyond positive reaction to the recognition: "i'd rather have that than the oscar...it shows that people who struggle in this society with public image and being behind the eight ball with their rights, they recognize that someone like me who has the microphone can support them."
Female: 100%, Male, hear ye, hear ye! i doth proclaim myself a full-fledged (or as close as i can be) adult. i’ve schooled. i’ve worked. i’ve lived. i’ve toiled. i am a fully-fledged adult. i’ve taken on responsibility. i’ve buckled down when the times required me to. i’ve been the epitome of emily post’s great-great-grandchild. yes, i am a full-fledged adult. i may now proceed onto bigger and better things. i am an adult who is comfortable in their own chupa chups skin. i’m as honest as can be. i feel really guilty lying to people, but i’m not one to shy away from a little white lie; you know, like the few times a homeless person comes up to you and asks you for change and you say you don’t have any. i mean don’t get me wrong. i give up my change if i have it. however, if i’m not in the best financial situations, i’m most certainly not going to give up my laundry money quarter to a stranger who’s probably making good on loose change. if i can’t afford to give coins, i do my best to offer whatever food i may have. (haven’t you noticed that although they say they want something to eat, they’d rather get the cash instead?) so, yes, i am a fully-fledged adult. i practice good hygiene. in the winter, i shower, floss, brush, and rinse at least twice a day; morning and night. when summer time arrives, it’s at least three times. i commit to nourishing my body with healthy foods. i’ve just taught myself to eat celery. i’m not 100% there but i’m a good 40% there. i’ve taught myself to eat spinach, broccoli, bean curd, tofu, etc. yes, i am a fully-fledged adult. sadly, as this fully-fledged adult, my metabolism isn’t the best. it’s increasingly slowing down. it’s harder for me to manage my weight. although i’ve not gained much weight, i’ve also not been able to lose any; mostly because i forget the most important part of the component of weight loss- actually get up off the couch. sigh. so to the world: i doth proclaim my adultness. i am one of you. i’ve joined your ranks. i’m a doer and not just a follower. world, that is all. please continue with your day. goodbye.
Female: 100%, Male, being busy with a lot of open projects at work and school has made me a bit tired. i get off work and have to go to school. i finish an exam at school and i have to deal with a tight deadline at work. sometimes, i want to “pause” what’s going on around me and go and walk for couple of hours. i need to get my thoughts organized and defragged. i feel a subtle touch of fear in missing deadlines or missing important tasks. i’m always repeating/reviewing my todo’s list in an effort to prevent any missed task. i hope i can stretch my mind over all these tasks and get to a level where i can handle multi- multi -tasking . as oliver wendell holmes puts: a mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimension
Female: 100%, Female, i just sent this video (that's my king) to my best friend and her response is overwhelming! her awe reminds me of my own awe, her joy of my own joy, her faith of my own faith. it's just what i needed to keep on going... so many things to say about my king- words that barely describe him already put me in silence. i've been avoiding the monologues-i've been sitting on the computer doing everything else. i've been eating grapes, talking on the phone, asking help for the monologues, getting ideas for the monologues, talking about the monologues but not actually doing them. "i think i'm avoiding monologues... i guess i am scared god won't provide..." and do you know what she said? "god is a provider, he always provide." what i need to do is: just believe. this is where i stop thinking abstractly about faith and live it out. step one- just start. he will not pick you up from the ground, no, he will help you up as you overcome, you must start walking (faith) and he will lift you (grace) and you will fly... p.s. god remembers us and who we are! he sends angels...
Female: 56%, Female, now, these may have been around for ages, we can't really be sure because, truth be told, it's pretty rare for us to troll the aisles of kohl's makeup section looking for kirfs. regardless, a helpful, hawk-eyed reader snapped this shot of an eyeshadow palette -- called eyemobile -- that's got the distinct iphone aura going on, though we're 100 percent certain this is an unauthorized use case. it's hard to say from the photo, but it also looks like there's a lip gloss palette in the background (which we assume is called lipmobile), and that, friends, we would pay money for. lots of money.
Male: 100%, Male, does life behind the mouthpiece sometimes feel like there's a camera on the front of your bell, and you're on a high speed bobsled going ninety miles an hour? all the notes are flying by faster than they can be processed. we're on a race desperately trying to maintain control, dropping more notes than we nail. is this a trumpet or a runaway toyota? somebody help! remember what dad did when the family would get lost on vacation trips? he drove faster! why is it that the harder the passage, the faster we go? instead of the panic button, we should hit the brakes. with treacherous curves at every turn, cooler heads and slower practice speeds ought to prevail. dr. phil has a two-word remedy for this ailment: slow down! everything improves at slower speeds. notes can be seen, heard and controlled much better in slow motion. think paycheck. you only get paid for well-played notes, period. why not perfect as many notes as you can at your own comfortable tempo? high speeds may be resumed when conditions are safe.

Female: 100%, Female, it started out innocently enough. last week while on the phone with my mom and one of my sisters, the subject turned to movies. i told them how excited i was about alice in wonderland and joked that i even considered making a "mad hat" just for the occasion. after all, one can't have so many favorites in one project and not commemorate. (those favorites being johnny depp, tim burton, anne hathaway, helena b-carter and the tale of alice, of course.) we all got a good laugh out of it, and then the topic of conversation changed again. i thought no more of it until the next day. at work i looked around my desk at all the random doo-dads and trinkets. i knew why they were there - to add a bit of whimsy to my space, some fun and silliness. "ha!" i thought to myself, "could you imagine putting those things on a hat? how curious." i came home, and while taking off my jewelry, i noticed more little things on my dresser: various pins and buttons, a pocket-watch that still needs a chain, a fuzzy lapel pin that looks a lot like a tribble. "well, i do seem to have the materials, if i were so inclined..." thursday night found me with all manner of delicious nonsense spread out across my coffee table. "but you love that hat," homeboy said. "none of the changes will be permanent," i assured him, "i'm only using hat pins and tape." i had forgotten how much fun arts and crafts can be. fixing and fastening, arranging, rearranging, positioning just so... i really did enjoy myself. and, in true childlike fashion, i couldn't wait to show it - "look what i made!" the silliest part may be that i'm not at all embarrassed. at no point did i feel like i was too old to do such a thing. to be honest, i am quite relieved to find i am capable of such nonsense.
Male: 100%, Male, a recent article gave an interesting look into exorcism as practiced within the roman catholic church. according to father gabriele amorth, the vatican's chief exorcist, the unfortunate sex abuse scandals in the catholic church is proof that "the devil is at work inside the vatican." astonishingly, father amorth indicated that he participated in around 70,000 exorcisms during his 25 years as a catholic exorcist. for any of you who are counting, that's a claim of approximately 7.5 exorcisms per day, for the last 25 years! while father amorth's description of satanic possession seems quite graphic, from at least one personal experience i can affirm that a good portion of it is fairly accurate. i previously wrote about satan's power and influence in a related post. without delving into the controversial sex abuse scandals or trying to figure out how father amorth has time to sleep or eat with his busy exorcist schedule, i'd like to discuss priesthood authority and its connection to rejecting satanic presence. particularly, is christ's true priesthood required to command satan and his subjects? can the faith of an individual (or the combined faith of those present) be used in an exorcism instead of invoking or wielding the true priesthood authority? the apostle john once remarked to the savior that "[the apostles] saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us. and jesus said unto him, forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us" (luke 9:49-50)(emphasis added). does this mean that those without christ's true priesthood authority are able to command and cast out devils as much as one with authority? commenting on the phrase "he followeth not us," elder bruce r. mcconkie wrote: "he was not one of the twelve to whom the express power had been given to cast out devils (matthew 10:8); he was not one of the inner circle of disciples who traveled, ate, slept, and communed with the master. luke has it: 'he followeth not with us'; that is, he is not one of our traveling companions. but from our lord's reply it is evident that he was a member of the kingdom, a legal administrator who was acting in the authority of the priesthood and the power of faith. either he was unknown to john who therefore erroneously supposed him to be without authority or else john falsely supposed that the power to cast out devils was limited to the twelve and did not extend to all faithful priesthood holders. it is quite possible that the one casting out devils was a seventy. ... "only righteous men who are members of the church, who hold the priesthood, and who are keeping the commandments, have power to perform miracles.... our lord had many faithful followers who had power by faith to cast out devils" (doctrinal new testament commentary, 1:417)(emphasis added). to be clear, i do not believe the catholic church wields the true priesthood of god. consistent with lds theology, i believe christ's true priesthood was lost to the world at large during the great apostasy. however, i also do not believe that catholic exorcists, such as father amorth are followers of satan. (see matt. 12:25-26) notwithstanding, is it possible that exorcisms can still be effectuated by individuals lacking the priesthood through an exercise and display of faith? the prophet joseph smith taught that "faith is not only the principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth" (lectures on faith, 1:13)(emphasis added). indeed, it was faith that was invoked to frame the worlds (heb 11:3), and it is through faith that all created things exist. "[faith] is the principle by which jehovah works, and through which he exercises power over all temporal as well as eternal things.... and if the principle of power, it must be so in man as well as in diety" (id. at 1:16, 18)(emphasis added). when the twelve were unable to cast a devil out of a "lunatick," they queried the savior on how he was able to finish what they could not. christ then proceeded to teach them doctrines of faith, not of priesthoods. "because of your unbelief: for verily i say unto you, if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting" (matt. 17:20-21)(emphasis added). thus, since prayer and fasting doesn't have any effect on whether one possesses the priesthood but instead affects one's level of faith, it appears that exorcism relies more on the principle of faith than on one's authority. admittedly, i have not taken part in or seen a catholic exorcism (apart from what hollywood concocts). i have, however, taken part in a handful of lds exorcisms and can attest that one's faith plays an enormous role. still, i am not certain of the extent that god's priesthood plays in such instances. is the pristhood required simply to keep order? yet, if an individual lacks the priesthood but has sufficient faith in the lord jesus christ, can that individual command evil in his name? and, if that is the case, does father amorth truly exorcise evil spirits during his claimed frequent encounters?
Male: 100%, Male, "each time andrew sullivan writes negatively about israel (which is to say, almost every day), my e-mail in-box becomes flooded with pleas that i respond. sometimes i don't, because i have other, better things, to do. but last week, after andrew published an egregious and tendentious map meant to deny jewish claims to virtually any of the land of israel, i did respond, helped along by about 130 e-mails from readers who were as upset as i was that the atlantic magazine's website featured such crude agitprop. i responded quickly, and angrily (even making a mistake in accusing andrew of not attributing the map. he did, to the anti-israel academic juan cole.) then, of course, andrew responded quickly and angrily, and i spent a good deal of time thinking of ways to respond to his response to my response. and then i realized that this is not how i want to spend my life. yes, it's upsetting that andrew sullivan, a man of obvious intellectual gifts (and someone for whom i retain great personal fondness), has become an anti-israel propagandist. but it's not my job to counter everything he says. he's not particularly interested in hearing fact-based arguments that undermine whatever argument he happens to be making, in any case. and even if he did care, it's not in the best interests of the atlantic, or of my journalism, or my sanity, to spend my time worrying about andrew's ever-shifting views on the middle east. so i'm unilaterally disengaging from this struggle. i pray, of course, that andrew comes to see that his oversimplification of middle east history and politics has caused real damage to real people, but it's time for someone else to argue with him. there is another benefit to disengagement. as goldblog readers know, i'm deeply distressed by many currents in israeli society and politics, the continuing, disproportionate power of the settlement movement being chief among my concerns. but i find myself hesitant to criticize israel these days because my words are inevitably used by people who don't have israel's best interests, or the best interests of american jews, at heart. so i want to find a new way to write about these issues. the new way, obviously, is the old way. the best use of my time, i think, would be to return to what i originally was meant to do when i joined the atlantic a couple of years ago, which is to write reported, carefully considered, fact-checked and closely-edited articles about the issues that interest me. in other words, don't expect to see too much on goldblog about this set of issues, generally. i appreciate all of your letters (except those that begin ""dear zionist douchebag,"" or, ""dear self-hating jewboy douchebag""), and i'll figure out, as i go forward, what to do with this blog, but i don't think that writing in anger is good for anyone. so here's hoping that the goldblog unilateral disengagement plan goes better than the gaza disengagement plan." 
Male: 100%, Male, note: my apologies for the prior version of this post. i wrote it too quickly and did not give it a good proof reading. i read an article the other day by arthur langer about how it can survive the current economic recession. i was struck by the following piece of advice: “move more it expenses into business units. this keeps all the dollars from being in one large it budget. it also allows business units to defend their requests for extra spending.” i read this recommendation a few times. langer’s other advice, shown below, makes sense. the points below are sound. * show why investments need to precede—not lag—the recovery. give historical proof that this method works and timelines that will better position the business to compete. * ask for smaller amounts of investments, allowing the business to be somewhat cautious should economic trends not improve. * don’t expect the budget you might ultimately need, but rather the dollars that will allow you to deliver some portion of the overall product strategy. * commit to product reviews, perhaps every 90 days. this way, executives can feel that they can change priorities if and when necessary. the idea of moving (hiding) it expenses in the business unit to make them small enough not to be noticed seems out of place in this list.
Male: 100%, Male, this is a longer version of a story that will appear in the sunday calendar section of the los angeles times and also on the cover of brand x. bryan singer and lauren shuler donner through the years, comic-book films took audiences to all the predictable places, including the grim streets of gotham city and the doomed spires of planet krypton, but, a decade ago, a new type of comic-book film had the audacity to set its opening sequence in a truly unexpected place -- the gates of auschwitz, where jewish families were bring marched through mud on their way to death and despair. from those first moments, "x-men" set itself apart from the entire hollywood history of comic-book adaptations and marked the beginning of this current era of fanboy cinema, which has dominated the box office and elevated san diego's comic-con international into something resembling a cannes for capes. "the opening, it really was a declaration of intent," producer lauren shuler donner said of that sequence, which showed a terrified young boy exhibiting mutant powers as his family was separated by german guards. "it said to the audience this is a serious film, grounded in the realistic and the historic and somewhat dark. it was so smart. and it was all totally bryan." that would be bryan singer, the director of "x-men" and its first sequel, who was sitting next to shuler donner in her office on a recent afternoon. the pair both had big smiles on their faces -- they had been reunited by an invitation to reminisce about the legacy of the july 2000 release, which they were happy to do, but the conversation kept veering into giddy plans for the future. singer is returning to the "x-men" universe, it's clear now, for a project called "x-men: first class"; it's all just a matter of timing.

Male: 98%, Female, in a nutshell: we have used the model #22205 daily since 1997 the model 22205 is almost an exact twin of the model offered here, except it was offered for sale to us in 1997. we have 5 children and this brave little toaster has seen alot of service since 1997 without a single problem. what it's all about: 900 watts - white enamel finish - crumb tray we have used and overused this little appliance and while 5 coffee makers and 3 'foreman grills' have worn out this toaster keeps toasting just like it always has. caution: hot to the touch like toasters of old, this one is hot to the touch with only thin metal and white baked enamel between your fingers and the red hot nichrome filaments that are powered by 900 watts of electricity. actually, it was the 900 watts versus 7-800 watts of other toasters that got me to buy this in the first place. it even has a crumb bin! well, 9.5 years and counting, but soon we may want to replace it for a 'cool-touch', though i think we will always keep this brave little toaster around for sentimental reasons.

Male: 100%, Male, a northwest side man listed as a potential threat to judges tried to enter the daley center with four hunting knives he had just purchased, according to the cook county sheriff's office. kevin j. long, 48, of the 4500 block of north milwaukee avenue, walked into the building tuesday afternoon and passed through a metal detector while his bag was sent through an x-ray machine. a cook county sheriff's deputy saw images of several knives in long's briefcase. when asked what was inside, long allegedly said it was "just papers," according to a news release from the sheriff's office. long allegedly told investigators he had come to the daley center to visit the law library and had forgotten about the knives, which he said he bought earlier in the day as a gift for his brother-in-law. he was charged with unlawful use of a weapon and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon, both of which are felonies. long has been on parole since november after serving 15 months in prison for telling a witness in a civil case that he would kill the witness's child. his name also is on a list developed by the u.s. marshals service and the cook county sheriff's department naming individuals who may pose a threat to judges or court officials. long also has been arrested 18 times since 2000 for various incidents, including being caught in a judge's chambers and public indecency. cook county circuit judge donald panarese set bail at $350,000 on wednesday, according to tandra simonton, spokeswoman for the cook county state's attorney's office. he was denied bail on the parole violation, and panarese barred him from entering any cook county courthouse unless he was required to be there and unless he was accompanied to and from the courtroom by a sheriff's deputy, simonton said.
Female: 100%, Female, clifford’s own connection to soup is profound. as a ten-year old vacationing in spain, he is taken for his first meal in a fine dining restaurant: a bowl of soup can be a powerful dish. it recalls memories, warm the heart and soul, and can use up plenty of leftovers in our cupboards and refrigerators. clifford wright’s the best soups in the world (wiley 2010) appeals to all these aspects of soup. his book delivers recipes from around the world with intelligent commentary. even as the weather warms up this spring, get out the soup pot and make some soup. it starts as almost all soup books do, with basic broths (p. 9) followed by clear soups (p. 19). the real action is in the next chapter on chunky meat soups (p. 41) the first recipe isn’t for a standard beefy mushroom soup, but for blackfoot bison and blackberry soup (p. 42) for which you need buffalo bones, suet and meet and spicebush berries, all of which might be hard to find. clifford calls the recipe a “curiosity”, but he expects the reader to make the soup, even with the substitute ingredients of beef bones, suet and meat, and juniper berries. what is really interesting is that in the recipe notes he writes about who the blackfoot nation are (three different tribes) and a bit of their culinary culture. he follows with a recipe for shchi (p. 44), the russian beef and sauerkraut (or fresh cabbage) soup that has a thousand variations, and borshch (p. 46), along with an essay on “everything you want to know about borshch” that covers the history of borshch and the boscht belt. from there clifford roams the world, from greece with avgolemono meatball soup (p. 50) to polish zurek (p. 54) to turkmen boiled soup (p. 63). there are side essays that fill you in about soup practices in africa or specific kinds of obscure soups. although there is a wealth of information, the recipes dominate – this is a book to cook with and enjoy. 
Male: 100%, Male, "always good to see hospitality-industry facilities that are in touch with local history and heritage. in its previous incarnation, as the mere shattuck hotel, this venerable establishment had become somewhat seedy. this is the first time i had seen it since its re-opening and re-branding last year. you can still tell that it was built in 1910, but (mainly) in a good way. peace! in-flight video at the site. place your order here. expected cost ""will be about the same as a high-end motorcycle or car,"" according to the faqs. i know this routine! when rationalizing buying a small airplane to my family, i avoided referring to ""dollars"" and instead tried to get away with the luxury-car counting-unit too. the faq list also includes, what happens if the engine stops? the answer involves a parachute. 2) courtesy of usa today, a sane statement from a tsa official! the tsa's john sammon, referring to possible changes in policy in light of the terrorist crash of a small airplane into the irs office in austin last month, said: ""it may simply be a confirmation that for very small planes you're not going to see a lot of casualties."" obviously even one casualty is too many; obviously too, anti-irs and anti-institutional violence of any sort is no joke. but to be sustainable, a security policy must make sensible tradeoffs of risks and rewards; in a free society, it must also reflect a sensible long-term balance between security and liberty. you could entirely eliminate the risk of airplane hijackings or bombs if you didn't let anyone fly; you could entirely eliminate gun deaths if there were no guns; no risk of car bombs if there were not cars; etc. panglossian that i am, i will take mr. sammon's comment as the dawn of a new age of sensible balance coming out of the tsa. 3) courtesy of the guardian, news that darpa, the pentagon's advanced-research body, is close to tests of a scheme to make jet fuel out of algae. this has obvious advantages over making jet fuel out of crude oil from petro-dictatorships. it has a less obvious advantage, which is that algae absorb about as much carbon when growing as their fuel releases when burned, for a much lower net-carbon impact. and unlike the benighted ethanol-subsidy program -- winner of a ""stupidest policy ever"" contest -- growing algae doesn't compete with growing crops for food. i hope this turns out to be feasible. 4) what the hell: courtesy of crunch gear and sky news, let's wind up with another new zealand candidate for ""interesting"" ways to fly. it's a home-built flying hovercraft. i can't embed the three-minute video, but it is worth going to the site to watch. the young woman reporter who takes a ride on this thing is lot more risk-tolerant than i have ever been, in either my reporting or my aviating life. or perhaps more naively trusting. either way, she ends up having an unexpectedly dangerous exciting ride. more on the story here, including a shorter video that doesn't include the dramatic last minute." 
Male: 100%, Male, i am pleased to announce that salvatore sanfilippo, the key developer for redis, has decided to join the vmware engineering team. redis is a high performance and scalable advanced key-value store where values can be data structures such as lists, sets, and hashmaps, as well as strings and blobs. redis supports atomic operations on these data structures, allowing extremely high performance with consistent state to many client applications. as vmware continues its investments in the context of cloud computing, technologies such as redis become key for future cloud based apps, whether private or public cloud, and the cloud infrastructure itself. large scale systems benefit greatly when there are alternatives to storing state within a centralized relational store (rdbms). many redis customers have already experienced the tremendous benefit of storing select pieces of data within redis for fast access, customized layout and access patterns. some have used redis exclusively, forgoing a relational database all together, since redis offers several ways to persist the data it manages. as cloud computing continues to push the bounds of how we define a cloud application, many exciting and new technologies will join the relational database as a means to store and retrieve data. cloud based infrastructure itself has led the way in this regard, pushing the envelope for scale, performance, and access to large distributed data. this is most evident in google's app engine, utilizing several pieces of key technologies like bigtable to store data at scale.
Female: 100%, Female, "next up, blood-thirsty bunnies marlo is officially down to two naps. for those of you who do not have children, that first sentence will mean nothing to you. for those of you who do, you probably just experienced an instinctual pain in your chest at the memory of what it means to plan your life around your baby's sleep schedule. or is that just me? i can't be the only one who has run outside and verbally berated the garbage truck driver for disturbing a nap, there goes the rest of my day. garbage truck diver, snow plower, mail carrier... all have been informed at one time or another of marlo's sleep schedule. it goes like this: when marlo's asleep, no one is allowed to breathe. the end. you don't want that crazy, short-haired southern lady who looks like an eight-year-old boy running out into the street in her bare feet. she may be liberal, but she's related to people who own guns. and just this week we've managed to manipulate her schedule so that she's sleeping in until 6:30 am. do you have any idea how indulgent this feels, to sleep in so late? no, you don't understand. it like we're fifteen years old, and suddenly the prophet has declared that pre-marital sex is totally okay. i guess i should say, that one time we slept in so late since our other child has decided that days now begin at 5 am. read that again: five o'clock in the morning. you want to know why? because she thinks a leprechaun is tapping on her window. i cannot believe i just wrote that sentence. i mean, i can understand a fear of spiders or earthquakes or rats that are big enough to eat your face off. but, little green dudes? if anything you want them at your party because they can hold their liquor. also, don't they all come with marshmallows? and, i don't remember ever talking to her about leprechauns, so i'm guessing this is one of those rotten things she picked up at school, like addition and subtraction. and what do you know, it is. turns out one has been coming into their classroom and leaving notes in the days leading up to st. patrick's day. and this afternoon when i told her teacher about this early-morning tapping leprechaun, she said with a gleam in her eye, ""oh yes, he'd be tapping, for sure. they're cobblers, you know."" haha! i'm laughing because, that is just so damn brilliant. they have to deal with our kids all day long, and oh no. is your kid waking up early? how sad for you who get to send them away all day. it's like, if i'm going to blame the teacher for the leprechaun, she's more than happy to break out her fifty-page, single-spaced document of quirks she'd like explained, thank you very much. well played, elementary school teachers. well played. that decrepit old hag this is quickly and steadily becoming a list of my ailments blog, and " 
Female: 100%, Female, this iron hardly got hot enough to flatten anything. very little heat production, maybe faulty item, but warranty service was poor. my hair is quite curly and so needs straighening every day. the sedu does straighten reasonable well but it takes quite a lot of time and also the machine has a design fault (or so it seems) as it is extremely easy to trap your fingers in it while using it. i was impressed by the sound of the product having tourmaline plates which are meant to help prevent split ends.i like it very much! i like the 1" better than the wider 1 1/2" because i have bangs (that absolutly must be staightened) but it still works great on my long hair. and it makes it sooo soft. and well that just makes me smile.so just buy it already. really you will be so glad you made the choice. i used to straighten my hair in the salon and it takes me too much time. then my friend suggest me to try it myself with a hair straightener. and she recommended sedu. i really didn't want to spend as much as this hair straightener costs, but after reviews, and needing one that didn't rip my coarse & curly hair to shreds, i relented. well it is a wonderful tool. it heats up extremely quickly and my hair is shiny, & silky smooth. i'm also applying biosilk silk therapy to my hair prior to flatironing. thanks to both the flatiron and the silk therapy, the formerly very tough job of hair straightening is now far easier for me. thanks very much!
Male: 100%, Male, as the company credited with practically inventing the netbook category, it's no surprise asus makes some of the most popular mini notebooks around. top among these is the eee pc 1005 series. combining low (but not the lowest) prices with great battery life and good overall design, the 1005 has become the netbook reference design for the entire industry. the newest version, the $379 eee pc 1005pe, is the first netbook to reach our labs with intel's new atom n450 processor--the long-awaited sequel to the atom n270 and n280 cpus found in nearly every other netbook. this new 1005 model, thanks to the re-engineered atom platform, is extremely efficient, and ran for more than 8 hours on our grueling battery drain test. that's extremely impressive, although the n450 was more of a mixed bag in our performance tests, beating other netbooks in some categories, but matching or falling slightly behind in others. beyond that, the 1005pe eschews most of the recent trends in netbook design, sticking with a 10-inch 1,024x600 pixel display, 1gb of ram, and windows 7 starter. we've become accustomed to the high-def 1,366x768 pixel resolution screens found on 11-, 12-, and even some 10-inch netbooks, so this lower resolution feels cramped and dated in comparison. nvidia's ion gpu is also becoming a go-to part for upscale netbooks, but is not included here. the eee pc 1005pe definitely scores points for being the first laptop out of the gate with the new n450 cpu, and its battery life is nothing short of amazing--making this a very useful system for serious road warriors. but we would have liked to see a 1005 that was more fully upgraded across the board. 
Male: 100%, Male, from china, wei, 27, is a software programming student at the illinois institute of technology and hopes to become a computer financial analyst. he is in chicago on a student visa. "there is a big future for financial programming," wei said about his plans, sitting inside a modest bridgeport apartment he shares with his wife and recently born son. "not many people know how to do this work, or want to." for wei's 44-year-old half-brother, life in the u.s. has not been so bright. fleeing poverty, the brother arrived illegally from china nine years ago. after a harrowing trip orchestrated by "snakehead" smugglers, he has toiled 14-hour days for sub-minimum wages inside chicago restaurants. "his life here has been a kind of torture," wei said. immigrant advocates hope sunday's march will pressure president barack obama and federal lawmakers into taking up their demands for comprehensive reforms in the coming months. they argue that problems with the nation's immigration system have festered long enough -- with ongoing deportations hurting families and a booming black market in fake ids threatening national security. groups in favor of tougher enforcement of immigration laws, meanwhile, have used the march plans to rally their supporters. roy beck, president of the virginia-based numbersusa group, described sunday's march as "the opening kickoff" in any renewed immigration debate in washington. on thursday, sen. charles schumer, d-n.y., and sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c., outlined a new bill that is the latest effort in a campaign for proposals that have been defeated twice in recent years. among other things, the new bill calls for biometric social security cards and for requiring illegal immigrants to pay fines and perform community service before they're allowed a chance at lawful permanent residency. obama issued a statement on thursday pledging to get such immigration legislation moving through congress this year. immigrant advocates said they were encouraged by obama's remarks, but express frustration that the president has not fulfilled a promise to act on immigration reform earlier. "we need to see action," said joshua hoyt, executive director of the illinois coalition for immigrant and refugee rights. john darger said he has seen some of that anger in crystal lake, so he also plans to be on his way to washington. a teacher of english as a second language at mchenry county community college, he cited stories from his latino students about routine physical or verbal attacks, and resentful comments he's heard about newcomers from his neighbors. "the country needs to move beyond this divide," he said. up to 6,000 area residents left saturday on the roughly 120 charted buses for washington, at least half departing in a caravan from an evening rally outside u.s. cellular field. the turnout was the result of a weeks-long scramble for funds by immigrant activists and religious groups. marilyn navarro, 16, raised the $183 it took to get a bus seat for herself and a 25-year-old cousin by putting out a donation jar inside her parents' pilsen restaurant. navarro was inspired to go because her cousin arrived illegally with his parents as an 11-year-old. "it makes me so sad to know that there are millions of people out there like him," she said.
Male: 100%, Male, "it takes a little extra work to get in touch with andrea boland. the maine state representative answers e-mails and lists her business and home phone numbers on the web. but unlike many politicians surgically attached to their blackberrys, she keeps her cell switched off unless she's expecting a call. and if she has her way, everyone in maine — and perhaps, eventually, the rest of the u.s. — will similarly think twice before jabbering away on their mobiles. in march, maine's legislature will begin debating a bill she submitted that would require manufacturers to put a warning label on every cell phone sold in the state declaring, ""this device emits electromagnetic radiation, exposure to which may cause brain cancer."" her warning would continue, ""users, especially children and pregnant women, should keep this device away from the head and body."" for those of you now eyeing your cell phones suspiciously, it's worth noting that both the national cancer institute and the world health organization say there isn't evidence to support the assertion that cell phones are a public-health threat. but a number of scientists are worried that there has been a dangerous rush to declare cell phones safe, using studies they feel are inadequate and too often weighted toward the wireless industry's interests. an analysis published by university of washington neurologist henry lai determined that far more independent studies than industry-funded studies have found at least some type of biological effect from cell-phone exposure. several countries — including finland, israel and france — have issued guidelines for cell-phone use. and san francisco mayor gavin newsom, who began researching the issue when his wife was expecting their first child, is hoping his city will adopt legislation that would have manufacturers print radiation information on cell-phone packaging and manuals and require retailers to display the data on the sales floor. with 270 million americans and 4 billion people around the world using cell phones — and more signing up every day — a strong link between mobiles and cancer could have major public-health implications. as cell phones make and take calls, they emit low-level radio-frequency (rf) radiation. stronger than fm radio signals, these rf waves are still a billionth the intensity of known carcinogenic radiation like x-rays. the wireless industry contends that rf radiation lacks the strength to alter molecules in the human body; the federal communications commission (fcc) maximum for cell-phone-signal exposure is intended to prevent rf radiation from heating tissue to the point that cells are damaged. cell-phone rf radiation's ""effect on the body, at least at this time, appears to be insufficient to produce genetic damage typically associated with developing cancer,"" dr. robert hoover, director of the national cancer institute's epidemiology and biostatistics program, testified at a 2008 congressional hearing. but the body of research is far from conclusive. in 1995, lai co-wrote a study showing that a single two-hour exposure of rf radiation — at levels considered safe by u.s. standards — produced the sort of genetic damage in rats' brain cells that can lead to cancer." 
Male: 100%, Female, a few years ago mark mcpherson contacted me out of the blue asking if i was interested in taking part in a book project that focused on australian and american photographers. i thought, hmm... that's random, but potentially interesting. i knew very little about australia beyond the cliches of surfing, kangaroos and walkabouts. since hijacked was released i have been involved in an intense love affair with the country. thank you, mark, for opening so many doors. after three weeks touring about new south wales, i'm now in perth for a series of foto freo related events. thursday, stranded will have it's solo debut at the perth centre for photography. the show will include 33 images and i'm nervous and excited to see how they work together. foto freo also includes talks and shows by trente park, chien-chi chang, jon levy and friends and fellow americans carrie levy, stacy mehfar and andy adams. thanks to bob hewitt, june moorhouse, laura beilby and the folks at the perth centre for photography for inviting me to australia and foto freo. there is an interesting article in seed magazine that sums up recent research around the growing debate of whether animals are people. it would appear that many of the traits we have long considered uniquely human are not so unique after all. the debate feels less like a struggle for scientific clarity and more like a brainy ape's desperate attempt to hold on to his fragile sense of supremacy. instead of "what makes us human" being a question where we are able to constantly adjust the answer, maybe we should make it a statement and choose a definition that commits us to a more humane standard of dominion. a year ago i met stacy mehrfar for a drink at the half king in chelsea. we'd known each other since our early days printing in the color darkroom at the icp, but on that day stacy was in town from sydney, where she lives with her husband gavin. as we were catching up over a drink and talking about her new adopted country, she mentioned a strange phrase, tall poppy syndrome. tall poppy syndrome is an australian societal phenomenon where people who are seen to be successful are resented by their fellow citizens. having been raised in a country that preaches the religion of individual success (usa! usa! usa!), this concept was foreign to me. as we discussed it further we decided it would be a great structure for a photo series about australia.

Male: 100%, Male, everything in marketing has changed. the way budgets are divided. the way strategies are constructed. the way we view our customer and their needs. and why is this? social media. yes ‘social media’, the term that is used the world over by overpaid boardroom bluffers, blagging their way through a maze of seeding, virals, apps and videos of monkeys skateboarding. don’t get me wrong, done well (the vast majority are not) social media campaigns can engage the customer in a way that couldn’t have been imagined a decade or even five years ago. but my question is this; why when the internet is as free as the air we breathe, do digital agencies increasingly raise the budgetary bar? it's easy to see that some major brands are being convinced that they need enormous budgets to get results, whether that means investing in expensive applications and widgets or simply for the experience of the ‘digital guru’ they employ. in my experience there are indeed times when spending budget on social media tools and technologies is helpful or even crucial, but on-the-whole the most valuable asset we have when constructing social media campaigns remains our imagination. i know that sounds ‘disney’, but it’s true. chances are that the simplest idea, the idea the uses existing, free platforms and technology will capture the publics attention. we have all been in countless brainstorms that have gone absolutely nowhere; producing tired strategies that couldn’t sell megan fox to a 14-year-old. but every once in a while, in what seems like your 20th meeting of the day, someone will lean back, grin and smugly utter the words “what if we did this…”. it’s instant; everyone in the room knows that this idea is the one. you don’t know whether to kiss or punch the unsuspecting genius, but you all know that’s what he is, a genius. i can only imagine that the following ikea campaign was born of one of these moments. using a facebook facility familiar to all of us, ikea captured the attention of thousands of customers in launching their malmo store. the following video case study shows the industry that, when it comes to social media, there is simply no substituting for that creative moment... 
Female: 100%, Female, the elegant woman in the pink silk kimono attracts admiring glances from be-suited businessmen and elderly japanese women as she walks through the narrow, tourist-choked streets leading to tokyo's sensoji temple. the locals here in the old district of asakusa know a real geisha when they spot one — even if she is a tall westerner with olive-green eyes. from her rounded bun hairstyle to her pigeon-toed tabi socks, sayuki, otherwise known as anthropologist fiona graham, is decked out so immaculately in true geisha style that her admirers utter the same compliment as she passes by: kirei desu ne — she's beautiful. sayuki denies she's a flawless example of japan's ancient flower and willow world. "being a geisha takes a lifetime to perfect," she deflects, as she clacks along in lacquer sandals that she wears slightly too small to make her size-8 feet look more petite. sayuki, who was born in melbourne, australia, became the first foreign woman in the notoriously closed profession's 400-year history to formally debut as a geisha two years ago, in late 2007. "i've only just begun," she says. "to many of my geisha sisters, i'm still a walking disaster." it's all relative. near sensoji's majestic red gateway, gaggles of female japanese tourists are clad in flowery kimonos — a new retro fashion trend. sacrilegiously, they've added lace and frills to the fabric and wear garish costume jewelry. "also, they don't wear underwear. the geisha elders are scandalized," laughs sayuki, with only a faint aussie twang in her girlish voice. "i'm wearing four layers of lingerie under my kimono, so at least i've got that right." flaunting womanly curves is considered vulgar in the refined geisha realm; the layered undergarments, resembling silk bandages, ensure a tubular, demure silhouette.
Male: 100%, Female,  i am currently over in estonia, speaking at a conference in tallinn about media and marketing innovation. the lovely hando sinisalu from best marketing has been filling me in on the state of affairs over here. estonia has been incredibly hard hit by the recession, with an 80% reduction in advertising in print since its peak in 2008. he told me that very few advertisers are spending any money at all - the only category that is seems to be telecoms, where there is fierce competition. between 2000 and 2007, estonia was one of the fastest growing countries in the region, with year-on-year growth in consumption averaging around 9.5%. the economy shrank by a massive 14.1% last year, so times are very tough, but the hope of joining the euro next year is keeping people optimistic. my presentation was about the learnings we have from the festival of media and the festival of media awards, including lots of examples of media innovation, new technologies and branded utility. 
Female: 85%, Female, for those of you who loved the valentino spring 2010 ready-to-wear line – with it’s organic coral-shaped lace embellishments – when it first appeared on the however, on the retail pricing issue, these hit a more negative note. so, are these retailing for $1000, $2000, or even $3000? nay, i say. these babies will run you a cool $4700 – plus shipping. ouch. are these pretty? yes. unique? certainly. are they nearly 5k worth of all that? not in this shoeblogger’s humble opinion. what do you think?runway last year, you are in luck. luckily for jenn, this shoe was tickling my memory. it is definitely similar to styles that we saw being produced by many designers last spring; blending cage and gladiator sandal styles with a zip-front and high heel. after a little bit more investigation to jog my memory, these are eerily similar to the (now out of stock) christian louboutin ‘zipette’ that was available for sale last spring and the prior fall (2008-2009). that double platform has been favored by christian louboutin for several seasons now. unfortunately, these are past-season shoes which will make purchasing an original louboutin style a challenge and test of personal patience (which can pay off, if time is not an issue for you). on a positive note, there are several designers producing similar, zip-front, caged gladiator sandals for the upcoming spring 2010 season. the original louboutin zipette has long since sold out of luxury retailers such as saks and neiman marcus. so, now it’s up to jenn. does she wants to pursue a louboutin aftermarket shoe-quest? or would she prefer a to look at similar, but not identical, offerings that are currently available from several other brands? i have rounded up several alternatives if she is looking for a style to wear this spring, since a louboutin quest can take months or years. we hope that his helps jenn out in her quest for her perfect high-heeled cage gladiator. last month i had a short telephone call with courtney and philip mason, the owners of a young art-to-wear brand named ‘studio jellyfish’. call it a mini-interview, if you wish. and, despite the writer’s block that has been for some reason confounding me on this article (this is at least the 3rd draft i have worked on thus far), i am determined to finish this today. luckily, the hand-painted artwork of these shoes and handbags is striking enough to speak for itself, so i’ve decided to start with a few images to ‘get the conversation going’. these painted ladies all have their own personality – and names. names like ‘golden goddess’, ‘blueberry girl’ and ‘bubblegum girl’. you won’t find any generic style numbers here. of course, with every pair carefully embellished by hand, would you expect anything else? per courtney, each ‘girl’ has been designed prior to appearing on a shoe or accessory, and is then free-handed onto the fashion canvas using a paint pen medium. the handmade nature of the creative process makes each pair of shoes subtly unique. when asked if she had a favorite, courtney answered without a bit of hesitation, “bubblegum girl, and some new ones that are in the works.” (bubblegum girl is on the second row at the left.) these painted ladies all have their own personality – and names. names like ‘golden goddess’, ‘blueberry girl’ and ‘bubblegum girl’. you won’t find any generic style numbers here. of course, with every pair carefully embellished by hand, would you expect anything else?

ferragamo was immediately mentioned for classic appeal and style. when i mentioned how much their visual style reminded me of the bold simplicity of patrick nagel’s works – but with a hint of gwen stefani’s harajuku girls, philip agreed, saying, “you pretty much nailed it on the head.” he also noted in a separate comment that “we have twelve years working as graphic designers. we love what we do. we wanted to do something for ourselves and it seemed like a natural transition to move that onto shoes and fashion.” oh, and about the name; why studio jellyfish? (politely interrupting each other) “that goes back to when we first met. we both loved, still love the ocean. there was this south beach hotel with a jellyfish tank in the lobby. it reflects our love of the sea and has a lot of our past and memories in it.” so, writers block defeated. plus, there’s even a small positive to come from it; studio jellyfish is now holding a spring sale which ends on march 30th.
Female: 100%, Female, i can't get the stories of haiti out of my mind. a patient showed up at the port au prince hospital ward with a massive left sided paralysis, an obvious stroke. this 48 year old woman had collapsed the day before and was now accompanied by her three grown daughters, who were most attentive and worried. i examined her in the bed with other patients and families gathered around. (there is no sense of privacy and even an exam seems to be everyone's business in haiti). one daughter spoke broken english but i had a good translator that helped me get the information i needed. it was a sad story. they had been on the 5th floor when the earthquake hit. they fell straight down and dad was killed. one of the children had a crush injury to his leg and the entire remaining family was now "on the street". just surviving must have been such a strain. then...mom has a massive stroke. as i was examining the patient further, one daughter handed me a quickly scrawled note. it read. "i have a problem she have a aids" in this private way, the daughter wanted me to know her mom had aids. in a country with such poverty, lack of health care and lack of education, it is not a surprise that hiv and aids remains a significant problem and haiti is the caribbean island most affected by aids. there also remains a stigma and hiv infection is a big secret. once i asked my haitian interpreter to ask an emaciated patient if he was hiv positive and the interpreter couldn't even ask the question. it is just not done. it was a real act of bravery for that daughter to pass me the secret note.
Male: 100%, Male, i encountered some ideas on web discussions like - you don't need filters with digital, or the only filter you need is a polarizer, the rest can be done in post processing.... however, the big six filters that are useful to most photographers, cannot adequately replace with digital techniques..... one - the polarizer this is so obvious i shouldnâ€™t need to get into "why" you need it, but iâ€™m me, and that means iâ€™m going to talk about it anyway. any time light moves from air to a transparent substance, some of the light doesnâ€™t penetrate into the transparent substance and is reflected away. whether the light hits water on a lake, the natural oil on human skin, clear cellulose and wax on plant leaves and flowers, lacquer on a car or a guitar, or glass on a building, there are reflections. the reflections are â€œwhite lightâ€; they â€œfill inâ€ the color and reduce saturation. they reduce the detail visible under the clear substance. the blue of the sky is also polarized, and a polarizer can deepen the blue, and keep it from blowing out and rendering your sky a cloudless white or a drab gray. you can fight this with post processing, but you wonâ€™t win. when you boost saturation, you fix the things that were "robbed" of contrast, but you also oversaturate the things that weren't suffering from contrast robbing reflections. and you canâ€™t replace the lost detail. two - the 80a "color balancing" most cameras have sensors that are "daylight balanced". they have nice, balanced red, green, and blue channel responses in neutral colored scenes lit by daylight. they achieve their incandescent white balance by amplifying the blue channel over two full stops relative to the red channel. that adds a great deal of noise to the blue channel, so you see some pretty ugly shadows. it also makes it very easy to blow the red channel, especially when shooting red dominated subjects (human skin, cosmetics, and fall colors near dusk and dawn when the light is warm). using an 80a will often let you get an interior architecture image in a single shot that would have taken multiple shots and hdr to do otherwise. it also makes it much easier to shoot incandescent or candlelit scenes without blowing the red channel. three â€“ the neodymium enhancing sensor manufacturers (like film manufacturers before them) spend a lot of effort trying to get the red, green, and blue filters in the camera to do a tolerable job of seeing colors the same way a human eye sees them. normally, this is a "good thing", it reduces an annoying phenomena we techno-geeks call a "failure in observer metamerism", where colors that look identical to one "observer" (a human) look different to another observer (a camera, for example). the neodymium filter disrupts the nice "mimic the eye" characteristics of a sensor, and causes large-scale failures of observer metamerism. neodymium (sometimes called â€œdidymiumâ€) does it in a way that is very pleasing in a landscape or fall color photograph: browns that would be identical in the picture (or to the eye) suddenly separate, with one turning red, another going yellow. 
Male: 100%, Male, less than a month after the failure of its third launch attempt, the california-based firm space exploration technologies (spacex) is poised once more to loft a falcon 1 rocket. launch of spacex’s fourth falcon 1 rocket is set for sometime between 7:00 p.m. edt (2300 gmt) tonight and 12:00 a.m. edt (0400 gmt) on monday, according to an update from the firm’s ceo elon musk. “of course, if we see anything that requires investigation, the launch will be postponed, but we’ll let you know as soon as we know,” musk wrote in an update posted to the spacex web site on saturday. tonight’s planned liftoff will be staged from spacex’s launch site at the u.s. army’s ronald reagan ballistic defense test site on the kwajalein atoll in the about 2,500 miles (4,023 km) southwest of hawaii in the central pacific ocean. the launch will be broadcast live on the spacex web site (http://www.spacex.com) when the attempt begins. spacex’s falcon 1 rocket is a two-stage rocket with a reusable first stage that stands 68 feet tall (21 meters) and can haul payloads of up to about 1,256 pounds (570 kg) to low-earth orbit. the $6.7 million rocket weighs 60,000 pounds (27,200 kg), but has failed three consecutive times since its 2006 debut. on aug. 2, spacex launched its third falcon 1 test flight only to watch it fail when the booster’s first stage separated, then impacted the second stage as both flew 135 miles (217 km) above earth. an engine shutdown timing error was cited as the cause and could be fixed relatively easily, musk said at the time. “the fix was also very simple, requiring one line of code to be changed,” spacex officials said in a weekend update. while all three of spacex’s first falcon 1 launches have carried small satellite payloads, the fourth rocket is carrying “a a payload mass simulator of approximately 165 kg (364 lbs), designed and built by spacex specifically for this mission,” spacex officials said. china is just a week away from launching its third manned spaceflight into orbit and apparently hoping for a sell-out crowd. the country is selling tickets to watch for the planned late night sept. 25 launch of its shenzhou 7 spacecraft, but buyer beware: each seat goes for about 15,000 yuan, or about us$2,206 and ticket buyers will need to provide identification and a reference from their employer to vie for the limited spaces, according to the chinese web site china daily and the newspaper wenhui daily. while hefty, the ticket price apparently includes a flight to china’s jiuquan satellite launch center in the northwestern gansu province, as well as a four-day stay to watch the planned space shot, state media reported. china first invited space fans to buy tickets for a rocket launch last year, when the country launched the chang’e 1 moon probe from the xichang launch center in southwestern sichuan province. but those tickets went for about 800 yuan, or us$117, per person. some 2,000 people watched the lunar mission’s launch from a pair of platforms about 1.5 miles (2.5 km) away, according to press reports. but the northwestern-located jiuquan launch site is much more remote than xichang, and offers fewer amenities and other tourist hot spots, china daily reported. 
Male: 100%, Male, easy, but not necessarily right. in a letter to his younger brother, theo, from the asylum, van gogh articulately describes his deliberate approach to the work. "these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts," he writes. he even flicks at the criticism he anticipates: "people will tell me the mountains aren't like that." and with a literary flourish, he describes the effect he's after: "i've tried to express the time of day when one sees the green beetles and the cicadas flying in the heat." for all his troubles, van gogh possessed a powerful intellect and self-awareness that he revealed as much in his writing as in his art. a prolific correspondent, his letters were collected last year into a new six-volume edition that rounds out his personality. now a selection of those letters is on display alongside some of his finest paintings in the london royal academy's illuminating exhibition the real van gogh: the artist and his letters. (a bank of computers in one gallery offers instant online access to the entire correspondence.) they present a painter's lucid, blow-by-blow report on his own progress up to the end of his life. there is no doubt that van gogh was driven. he could work at a pace that suggests manic intensity as well as spontaneity. in the last 70 days of his life, he produced more than 70 paintings. but what the letters frequently reveal is careful preparation; he painted with a speed derived from forethought rather than wild-eyed frenzy. his correspondence with theo is scattered with sketches of proposed pictures, sometimes with color notations to give a better impression of the final work. the broad outlines of his later years suggest the artist's struggles with mental illness: bouts of heavy drinking and brothel-going, poverty and isolation, his explosive reaction to light and color in provence, his quarrel with fellow artist paul gauguin, self-mutilation—he presented his severed ear to a favorite prostitute—and finally his suicide at the age of 37. it all feeds the conventional picture of the artist as wayward genius.
Female: 100%, Female, why am i banging on about eggs all of a sudden on a saturday night (oops...actually it's 4am in the morning in hong kong here...)? well, because i've had a bit of an egg-citing whirlwind trip to hong kong where the first part of the trip was already mind bogglingly egg-citing but the second part also matched that egg-citing ness in equal measure. so that's a lot of eggs... but i promise there is a reason why eggs are present in the post and hah, it is by no means round about and forced. ok maybe it is... oh well, here goes... joyce aka the store which opened my eyes a little to hong kong's forward fashion acceptance last time i was there organised an even more eye-opening event to honour a special one-off project that rodarte has taken part in. the mulleavy sisters have created four one-off outfits inspired by four characters played by maggie cheung (in the mood for love, hero, the heroic trio, clean) that were on exhibition at a bash thrown last night which accompanied a premiere of a short film directed by wing shya (most known for his graphic design and photography work on many wong kar wai films...). rodarte. in hong kong. with maggie cheung. plenty of wong kar wai connections/connotations. whats.not.to.like. i'm getting to the eggs, i promise. i pretty much landed into hong kong feeling like a zombie but had to get stuck right into the proceedings of this event. first up, a cocktail preceding dinner at renowned dining experience yin yang (weirdly enough, i tried to book a meal here last time i was in hk...). in a group of about 18 peeps... there was maggie cheung bounding up to people introducing herself gaily and pretty much exuding friendliness and elegance. feeling small doesn't even quite cut it. it is one of those cliches that everyone of chinese origin (or maybe even non-chinese origins...) universally hearts maggie cheung and she has 'national treasure' written all over (judi dench, you doth protest too much about the term...!) and frankly i'm not going to exempt myself. she is someone both my grandmother, my mother and me can get down with and after meeting her and err.... not creepily watching her at dinner... no, not at all.... i can go back home with happy reports. the my mother will yelp with jealousy.

Male: 100%, Female, good news for u.s. territories; del. donna m. christensen (d-virgin islands) announced thursday she and fellow territorial delegates were successful in including the territories in the health care reform bill released by the house leadership. “after numerous meetings over the past two weeks with members and senior staff and with the leadership in the house, senate and with president obama, the territories are in the bill,” christensen said. while christensen is pleased with the current proposal she said the bill was not perfect but will play a “significant role in improving the health care of the american men, women and children living in the u.s. territories.” “not only will the u.s. virgin islands receive an enormous infusion of new medicaid dollars, but we also have access to the health insurance exchange.” christensen released a statement thanking, house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.), chairman charles rangel (d-n.y.), house majority whip jim clyburn (d-s.c.), senate majority leader harry reid (d-nev.), and her colleagues in the congressional tri-caucus, which includes latino and asia members of congress. “this whole process confirms that when ordinary people come together around common ground, extraordinary things can happen, christensen declared.
Male: 100%, Male, after a controversial delay in release last fall, martin scorsese and leonardo dicaprio's fourth collaboration shutter island has finally arrived. only an acclaimed master like the man who brought us raging bull and taxi driver would be bold enough to adapt dennis lehane's 2003 best selling mystery and faithfully recreate its haunting tone and down right creepiness. scorsese's talent for subliminally affecting his audience with his visual style is nearly unrivaled. there are many sights to behold in shutter island, some of them puzzling and others so bizarre that they may eventually find their way into your subconscious. what begins as a routine mystery soon evolves into a psychological trip. set in 1954 u.s. marshals teddy daniels (dicaprio) and his partner chuck aule (mark ruffalo) arrive by ferry to shutter island off the coast of massachusetts and home of ashcliffe mental hospital for the criminally insane. summoned by doctor cawley (ben kingsley) and deputy warden mcpherson (john carol lynch), teddy and chuck must investigate the disappearance of a dangerous patient. ashcliffe might as well be considered a fortress, because it looks inescapable, yet rachel solondo, a woman who drowned her three children, managed to vanish the night before. upon examination of her locked room, teddy discovers no evidence of an escape and begins to speculate it could have been an inside job. a clue left behind by rachel, that initially appear to be the scribblings of an insane woman, reveals itself to be a code called “the code of four” which teddy will frequently encounter. after a fruitless search of the island, teddy and chuck discovers one of the staff members, a dr. sheehan, is also missing and speculate that he may have helped rachel escape
Female: 100%, Female, i keep wanting to use the word webinar, but i can't decide if it is too jargony. this lexical conundrum reminds me of when the word workout went mainstream. it sounded too jargony to me, and i used to say go-to-the-gym and a not-so-snappy stand-in. should i use the word webinar? should i tell you how many times ryan paugh told me that i have to announce the webinar if i want people to come to it? i kept not announcing anything because i didn't know what to call it. whatever we are calling it, it will happen on this friday, 1pm est. (sign up here.) i know that people in australia cannot listen at this time slot. you have told me before, and i'm listening. one day i will do a webinar at midnight. one day i will record webinars so it won't matter so much what time slot they happen in. one day there will be world peace. on friday we will talk about finding fulfillment, which is actually like establishing world peace, just doing it one person at a time. in an act of full disclosure, i'm going to tell you that knowing what to do is not the hard part of finding fulfillment. doing it is the hard part. it's like breaking up with a terrible boyfriend when the sex is really good. not that i have ever had this problem. i have found that part of what makes a terrible boyfriend is terrible sex. but whatever. i can imagine the problem. the problem is that you know what to do and you don't do it. wait. actually, that's the problem with everything. like, i knew i was going to have to write a post about the webinar where i don't know if i should use the word webinar. i knew it wasn't going to change if i waited so long to write the post that ryan paugh wants to kill me. but i waited anyway. why do we not take the action that we know is the right action? i will not be covering this problem in the webinar.
Male: 100%, Male, amidst talk of an aging society and a depleting demographic dividend, appeals for a reconsideration of china’s one-child policy were voiced during the annual meetings of the national people’s congress and the chinese people’s political consultative conference held mar. 3 to 14. zhang yin, china’s wealthiest woman and member of the chinese people’s political consultative conference, called for a “gradual release” from the 30 year-old policy, with a three to five year trial period allowing some the right to have a second child before the nation as a whole. in an interview with southern weekend zhang said she was one among many who voiced concern over china’s low birth rate and the consequences of an aging society. (photo/don weinland) (photo/don weinland) in an open letter issued by the communist party’s central committee in september of 1980, the one-child policy was suggested in order to relieve the demographic tensions of runaway birth rates. the letter states that after 30 years of state controlled family planning, “different demographic policies can be adopted.”
Male: 100%, Male, last week we reprinted an article discussing the 3 steps design teams take when creating an experience vision to guide the direction of design toward their users’ ideal experience. once a design team creates that experience vision, they need to share it with everyone involved in the project to make sure everyone is on the same page as the design process progresses. while the process of conveying the vision to key decision makers on the project and within the organization is very important, the methods used to share the vision can vary greatly depending on budget, available resources, and the pool of creative talent. teams can use any technique, from expensive video-shoots with actors to low-fidelity stop-motion animation, as long as the vision helps the design team and stakeholders progress in the same direction and inspires team members to produce an improved experience. in this week’s uietips article, i once again go back to an article uie published in june 2007. in this article, knowledge navigator deconstructed: building an envisionment, i discuss how a successful envisionment that focuses on the users’ ideal experiences can lead a design team’s direction for years to come. i also explore the many creative techniques for making that vision clear to everyone involved with the project. does your organization have an experience vision? how are you guiding your design direction toward your users’ ideal experiences? what methods to share this vision have you used? join the discussion about this week’s topic below. also, i’m conducting a one day workshop in three different cities on secrets behind designing great user experiences. one of the topics covered is the making of a ux vision. i take the concepts i discuss in the article into greater depth. 
Female: 100%, Female, an 11-year-old girl -- a precocious reader -- was visiting my home a few weekends ago. over the past year, she'd devoured "the great gatsby," "the joy luck club" and "huckleberry finn." she noticed the review copy of picoult's 17th novel, "house rules," on my coffee table and said that she'd liked some of picoult's other works, especially "my sister's keeper" and "the tenth circle." i told her this new novel was wonderful. big mistake. shyly, she asked if she could borrow it. i'm an educator, someone who, by training and disposition, is inclined to applaud a young person's thirst for reading. but i grabbed that fat review copy out of the kid's paws so fast she didn't have time to blink. the possessive hoarder who wants to keep all good books within reach had been awakened. i muttered something inane about the reviewers' code of honor forbidding me to lend books before they've been published. hey, if this 11-year-old wunderkind has absorbed anything from her reading, she's surely learned the fundamental lesson of every jodi picoult fictional family: life's tough. throughout the long unfolding of "house rules," picoult keeps so many storyline streamers whirling in the air that it would be easy just to praise her technical mastery. but though the multiple plots and narrators are, indeed, adroitly managed, what most readers will cherish is the character of jacob hunt, an 18-year-old high school student with asperger's syndrome. (jacob, in goofy teen fashion, jokes: "asperger's. i mean, doesn't it sound like a grade z cut of meat? donkey on the barbecue?") asperger's rules jacob's life and the life of his family, which consists of his understandably resentful-but-guilty younger brother, theo, and his wry and exhausted mom, emma. (although dad sends child support, he fled the coop long ago.) emma ensures that a sense of routine -- so crucial to jacob's emotional well-being -- is strictly maintained from week to week. his clothes are color-coded in his closet; daily meals are color-coded too (monday food is green; tuesday, red; wednesday, yellow), and his diet is restricted, since glutens and caseins spark meltdowns. as emma observes: "frankly, with 1 in 100 kids in the united states being diagnosed on the [autism] spectrum, i bet i could have a top-rated show on the food network: alimentary autism. jacob doesn't share my culinary enthusiasm. he says that i'm what you'd get if you crossed jenny craig with josef mengele." 
Male: 100%, Female, on wednesday night, i was honored to be a guest on cuny tv's brian lehrer live, a weekly current events show filmed here in new york. i was there, along with marisa meltzer, the author of girl power: the nineties revolution in music and rob walker, who writes the nyt's "consumed" column and is also the author of buying in: what we buy and who we are. i was there to talk about the youtube phenomenon that is the haul video. if you've never seen a haul video, it's basically a person doing on camera what you usually do when you come back from a shopping trip: excitedly show what you've bought to anyone who'll listen. except in a haul video, you show it in front of your webcam and then post it on youtube for an audience of thousands. most haul videos are made by teenage girls, and most of the items been shown off are clothing or makeup, though a thorough browsing of the genre reveals that there are haul videos about a whole range of products, including groceries. it was a really interesting discussion, one that touched on issues of consumerism, teenage belonging and self-identity and on the cultural emphasis placed on women's beauty and the products we're encouraged to buy to achieve it. as you can imagine, i've been thinking a lot about haul videos in the last few days, and i think there are a few noteworthy things going on here. first, i think it's important to note that these videos are predominately made by teenage girls, and that the vast majority of the money they're spending is on clothes and on makeup. as i mentioned in the segment, the average american woman will spend over $20,000 on cosmetic products alone between the ages of 13 and 29. and that doesn't include manicures, pedicures, haircuts or colorings - that's just for makeup products. once you add in those services and include other services like tanning and waxing, the number goes up over $40,000. over the course of a lifetime, the average american woman will spend about $500,000 on making herself beautiful. half a million dollars. that's a studio apartment in new york. it's two full rides to medical school. and while a lot of women never go tanning or get a pedicure, and while products and services obviously cost less depending on where you live, as well as a number of other factors, that's still an enormous percentage of women's collective earnings being spent on making ourselves beautiful. as i said on wednesday night, i'm in no position to tell anyone how to spend their money, but i think it's important to take a moment and imagine all the other things we could do with that money, and to carefully examine the reasons why we spend it on making ourselves beautiful. i should clarify that i don't think these women are buying these products because i think they're vain or vapid. 
Male: 100%, Female, eco fashion has been a profoundly online phenomenon from the get-go. slowly but surely, however, boutiques are cropping up all over north america and europe. if you’re in vancouver, you don’t want to miss the chance to check out body politic founded by nicole ritchie-oseen in 2008 and located in the south main district of the city. body politic features some of the hottest green designers including stewart + brown, elroy and perfectly imperfect. ritchie-oseen says, “at body politic we began with the belief that sustainable and eco-friendly clothing didn’t mean sacrificing style. the goal was to fuel our absolute love of fashion and distinct style without compromising our environment, our community, or ourselves!” the space is as green as the fashion, with energy efficient lighting, re-purposed furniture and raw concrete walls as a neutral palette against which the carefully selected clothing and accessories stand out beautifully. can’t make it to vancouver? no worries! body politic also sells online at www.bodypolitic.ca. you can also keep up with the official body politic blog, follow them on facebook, and on twitter. supporting eco fashion designers and retailers is one of the best ways we can put our money where our ethics is. drop by in person or online and give body politic a looksee… the earthquake that shook haiti happened weeks ago, but the needs of the haitians are greater now than ever. doctors, supplies, and provisions must continue to be sent to assist families that are still suffering from the effects of losing everything–including loved ones. to answer the call, the independently owned jewelry company love heals has created four special pieces of which they will donate 100% of the profits to doctors without borders. if you’ve never heard of love heals, check out their website and touching story:
Female: 99%, Female, hi. i am kim moldofsky from morton grove, illinois. agliophobia is a fear of pain; iatrophobia is a fear of doctors, but i have yet to find a word that defines my biggest fear—a fear of pre-existing conditions. my fear of pre-existing conditions began years ago when i was diagnosed with sjogren's syndrome, an auto-immune disease that causes dry eye and dry mouth. my illness seemed more of nuisance than a health crisis, so i was shocked when after my husband’s employer went bankrupt and we lost our medical coverage, i was repeatedly told that i was uninsurable due to this condition. that was back in 2001, when i was 33 years old. eventually, my husband found a job with benefits. after a period of time, my faulty immune system was covered in full, which was helpful because by then i had developed rheumatoid arthritis. still, once it was diagnosed, and i found the right combination of medicines to combat my symptoms, life continued at a normal pace. we were happy to have medical insurance, but we didn’t have a great policy. we had a $5,000 deductible for our family, and with two young children under foot, we often met that deductible. at one point, i realized our high cost, high deductible actually penalized us for using the plan. for example, using the mail-order pharmacy aligned with our plan, it cost me over $2,000 a year for certain medication, a certain arthritis drug. on my doctor’s recommendation, i checked the prices at the local costco. it turned out that the same drug cost me less than $300 without my insurance at costco. in the fall of 2008, my husband lost his job and eventually his benefits. this time, i felt fortunate to find a private insurance, a private insurer saving me the expense of the state plan. however, like many policies, it does not provide coverage on the issues that matter most to my family, even my 9-year-old son has a pre-existing condition that is not covered. and of course, my arthritis, well they accepted me into a plan, into the plan with a special deductible for arthritis-related treatment. knowing that this typically only involves a couple thousand dollars of treatment a year, we felt okay with that. however, it wasn’t until after we had signed on the dotted line, the only dotted line that was available to cover my entire family, that we learned this deductible which i assumed was $5,000 or $10,000 was actually a $65,000 deductible—a $65,000 deductible for the most pressing medical condition in my family. it is not creaking bones that keep me awake at night—it’s the fear of developing a condition related to my arthritis that could send us tumbling into bankruptcy. although i have some coverage, i have a fear of unexpected news, odd test results, a new diagnosis. i have a fear of a new pre-existing condition, a phobia without a name. although we pay several hundred dollars a month for access to quality care, i am afraid to use it. i often ignore minor aches and pains. i have held off on some scheduled blood tests and exam, and i worry that my attempt to save a few dollars now could cost me dearly in the future if minor problems spiral into larger ones, but ironically, as long as people with pre-existing conditions can be denied coverage, spending money on doctor visits and tests to solve problems early on could actually cost more dearly in the future. 
Female: 100%, Female, so a few weeks(?) ago i got a message from some guy on okcupid. he seemed smart, funny, cute and familiar. like we’d met already. i couldn’t place him, though. so i replied to his message and said, straight out, you seem familiar, is it possible that we’ve met? a couple of days passed and i didn’t hear back from him, so i figured he placed me from somewhere (maybe we went out years ago, or something) and didn’t want to reply. in the meantime, i was getting some unwanted attention from a bunch of guys (young, persistent ones who clearly had been hearing wild things about older women) and so i decided to shut down the okcupid profile and focus on match and chemistry. so then a week or so later i got a message from that same guy on match.com, asking me where i went to/why i disappeared? i thought it was sweet the way he followed up with me on another site. but he didn’t mention my question about looking familiar. you know where this is going, don’t you? i think i’ve figured it out. after a few messages back and forth, he said something in a message that jogged my memory. i think he’s this guy. i’m 95% sure (but not 100%). it’s embarrassing that i don’t recognize him from his pictures or profile and that he doesn’t recognize me (my profile is almost identical, and while my pictures are new they really do look like me). but i have to admit, my memory is completely useless lately (i take some medicine that messes it up, and so i write everything down). and i’ve always been bad at recognizing people/faces. so now what? he’s been aggressively pursuing me, online, for weeks. do i just stop replying? do i tell him that i think we already went out last summer and tell him the details and see if it was him? do i just let it ride and go out with him, again, telling him nothing about my suspicions just to see what happens? could this possibly be the universe telling me that that bad date was a fluke and me and this guy should meet again? today's girl has really evolved in the last couple of years. i honestly didn't recognize her when i was going through the thumbnails! yesterday's answer is behind the cut. were you correct?
Female: 100%, Female, it's funny, but i barely remember the first time i visited new york. i was nine years old, and went with my dad and brother to see the world's fair in queens. i remember the it's a small world exhibit, but mostly i remember the car ride home on the jersey turnpike, gazing out at the brightly lit new york skyline and realizing for the first time that if it's dark outside, you can actually look sideways out the window and not get car sick. the next time i visited new york, i was on an eight grade class trip. i think we went to the united nations, but i don't recall that. here are the two things i do remember - (1) singing "99 bottles of beer on the wall"while stuck in traffic coming out of the lincoln tunnel onto 42nd street, which in those days was lined with peep shows and porn shops and (2) being a smart-ass with my friends and leaving a one-cent tip at the restaurant in tudor city where we were packed in and served overcooked salisbury steak, which was basically inedible. (even then, i was a food critic..) the third time i visited new york, i fell in love. it was a day trip i took during college with my best friends. i think we must have seen a play, but for the life of me, i don't remember what it was. this time it was lunch at mama leone's, which even i, the rube from philly, recognized as cattle call for tourists - the place was loud and packed and i felt like a number. and the portions? huge. like "i think i'm gonna' be sick", huge. so we decided to walk it off with a stroll in central park. and it was there, sitting under the wisteria arbor on the west drive, that i fell. hard. maybe it was the intoxicating floral perfume. combined with post-prandial carbohydrate overload and a bit of a buzz from the wine we had with lunch. and a warm spring day and best friends. and that skyline. (clearly, it was not the food...) all i knew was - i was in love. with a city. and i knew - i had to move here. 
Male: 100%, Male, the new tax will not be an "insurance fund" for the banking industry, as ministers are concerned that such a measure would simply encourage more risky behaviour of the sort that led to the financial crisis of 2008. instead resolution agreements (also known as living wills) will mean banks will be forced to break up should they ever fail again. "we do not see the point of creating a mega-fund to prepare for another banking failure," said one well-placed source. "we do think that where people are creating risk for the tax payer they should be taxed accordingly. "it will be similar to pollution taxes on industry to discourage damage to the environment." the international monetary fund will report next month on how the global community should respond to the need to control systemic risk in the financial system. it is believed that dominique strauss-kahn, head of the imf, will broadly welcome plans for extra taxes on banking's riskier activities. treasury officials said that britain would not "go it alone" on the new tax, and that it was likely there would be agreement on similar tax regimes across the world. the news comes after david cameron, the leader of the opposition, announced that the conservatives would be willing to act unilaterally on an international banking tax if there was no global agreement. tory sources said, though, it was unlikely they would have to, given signals from the g20. president obama has said that he supports new levies on banking in america. the uk banking lobby has warned that any tax on banks must not undermine attempts to resuscitate the economy. responding to mr cameron's speech yesterday, a spokesman for the british bankers' association said: "uk banks have already made changes to how they are structured and the amount of capital and cash they hold to help prevent any future problems. "we believe any further reforms need to be timely, considered and internationally co-ordinated so they do not restrict credit to individuals and businesses as recovery picks up speed. "taxpayer intervention to stabilise the uk banking industry is on track to be paid back. and we will work with everyone on issues around a last-resort intervention fund – as well as other means to protect the taxpayer should a problem arise in the future.but uk banks believe the best course is to wait for the outcome of next month's imf proposals." mr cameron announced the measures while speaking to supporters in putney, south-west london. he said: "this is no time to shy away from confronting some of the biggest vested interests in our country – the banks. we had the biggest bank bail-out in the world. we can't just carry on as if nothing happened." referring to president obama's plans to recover funds used to bail out us banks, he said: "why should it be any different here? a conservative government will introduce a new bank levy to pay back tax payers and to protect them in the future. "it won't be popular in every part of the city. but i believe it's fair and it's necessary." 
Male: 100%, Male,  i started explaining how atleast i was taking full advantage of my time to have adequate fun as compared to others who were just sitting and complaining. i was all ready to propose my concept of relativity again. but she had been listening to my rant like she usually does and then talked about one of her experiences. she told about her conversation with a person with no legs and how difficult it must be. but, the guy replied atleast i don't suck like the ones who have no legs and feet. imagine how much it would suck to be them. suffice it to say my friend was aghast at that attitude. she very simply asked me if maybe i was doing the same thing. if maybe i was the guy with no legs who still thought atleast he was better than a person with no limbs at all. i replied by saying that i was comparing myself with others not to feel better because of their misery but because i wanted to not be like them. for me it was about motivation rather than wallowing in shared misery. it was one of those moments when you yourself realize you have said something really smart. she thought so too i guess because she actually wrote my rohanism down ;). but this is what your smart friends do to you. they extract these insightful thoughts out of you, but still leave you with doubts. but this is what i relish. this is what i feel is the best part about having them around. life would be so much simpler if you were surrounded by people as dumb as as yourself. but smarter ones make life interesting. they challenge and disagree with your way of thinking without intending too. that conversation left me in a similar place. even though i seemed to have convinced my friend, i wasn't sure i had convinced myself. but, the great thing about that conversation is that ever since that day, i have pretty much abandoned my silly concept of relativity. now every time i compare myself in a situation, i take a moment to figure out the reasons for which i am doing it. ever since that day, i have tried to follow that smart rohanism i uttered out of nowhere. for the most part, it has helped :) i like analogies. i love drawing parallels in life. compare one stage with another. find something in common in two completely different walks of your own life or others. to see how as we change we still remain the same. friends say its an annoying habit of drawing analogies between seemingly disparate sources. to try and explain every occurrence i see by comparing it to something totally mundane and unrelated. as if it's a self trained mechanism to automatically explain things to myself that might seem out of the scope of my knowledge base. one thing i have observed with a lot of friends as they have moved away from home for jobs or studies is the sudden onset of loneliness. 
Male: 99%, Female, acne is the word every teen hates but faces this nightmare at one point or the other during her growing years. there are as many numbers of creams and lotions available as the number of teens with acne! new research suggests that a diet with foods containing low glycemic loads could help people suffering from acne to get rid of their acne. scientists from th rmit university in melbourne studied the effect of food on about forty three patients aged between 15 and 25 years. they were randomly assigned a normal diet and a low glycemic load diet for 12 weeks. the diet consisted of 25 percent energy from protein and 45 percent from low-glycemic-index carbohydrates. it was found that people whose diet consisted of low-glycemic-index carbohydrates had a significant reduction in the total acne when compared to people on a normal diet. what is glycemic index? the glycemic index (gi) relates to the way your body’s sugar levels respond to certain foods. foods are given a rating from 0 -100 on the glycemic index with glucose in the highest position. high glycemic index foods (such as simple carbohydrates) will increase the body’s sugar levels rapidly whereas low glycemic index foods will increase the body’s sugar levels slowly according to hwf. the new findings suggest that diets that contain low glycemic loads may not only improve insulin sensitivity and helps reduce weight but clears up acne as well. so, if you want to get rid of acne and have a blemish free skin, foods that have high glycemic index like white bread, sugar, potatoes are a strict no. however you can eat low-glycemic foods like whole grains, vegetables, fish and lean meat as these foods are kinder to your skin and say good bye to acne forever
Male: 100%, Male, specifically, something hawks coach joel quenneville said after throwing minor-league call-up corey crawford into the net against the ducks on wednesday. crawford made one mistake, running off the leash and giving up a short-handed goal, but even in losing the horrifically officiated game, the kid played well enough that you know he’ll get another start. in fact, he might get it even after cristobal huet is sufficiently recovered from the flu. yeah, that would give the hawks three goalies, and man, you talk about a crisis of confidence, but quenneville’s post-mortem on crawford makes me think it’s coming. quenneville said crawford “looked comfortable’’ and “looked big.’’ those might seem to be harmless phrases because it comes down to stopping the puck and winning games, but here’s the thing: a coach doesn’t know that until it’s too late, until after the game, so he has to make a decision based on stats and gut feeling, not always in that order and not always equally. in quenneville’s case, the “looked comfortable’’ part is code for a coach feeling comfortable. the “looked big’’ part is how much net the goalie leaves open, especially after he drops to the ice. if there has been one significant reason that quenneville continually turns to rookie antti niemi when looking for a goalie to get hot and make him feel comfortable, it’s that. how much net can you cover when you’re vulnerable? niemi and crawford each are listed at 6-foot-2, an inch taller than huet, but niemi and crawford play bigger and wider when they go down. shooters appear to have less space up top against them than against huet. anybody can play goalie if the hawks are going to check the way they smothered the kings --- good thing, too, what with their lousy passing and puck handling --- but nobody can do that every night and goalies have to win games, or at least look like they can do it in difficult situations. bigger goalies do that. or goalies who appear to be bigger targets. size matters. so, you watch, crawford will be coming to a net near you. i would tell huet to get well quickly, but i don’t know if it will matter.
Female: 98%, Female, marisa meltzer is the author of girl power: the nineties revolution in music and the co-author of how sassy changed my life: a love letter to the greatest teen magazine of all time. she is a contributor at slate and the daily beast, where she reviews books and movies, and writes about gender in popular culture. girl power, which courtney posted about a few months ago, is about the evolution of the feminist message in music during the era when meltzer was coming of age. in the process of writing her book, meltzer, who was a fan of kathleen hanna and sleater-kinney as a teen, travelled around the country attending music festivals, revisited the records of her youth, and even got a chance to meet and interview some of the women who made those records. but she also confesses that in order to write girl power, she had to watch the spice girls movie. meltzer seems to have pretty much the coolest job in the world - spice girls movie aside. feministing readers who love music, movies and sarah haskins should check out meltzer's archive of writing for the daily beast. feministing readers who secretly love the bring it on franchise should wait until no one's around to see their browser tabs and then go read meltzer's analysis of the series. and now, without further ado, the feministing five, with marisa meltzer.
Male: 100%, Female, public=online is the the rallying cry during this year’s sunshine week, an annual event to highlight the importance of open government and the freedom of information. the week is sponsored by the american society of news editors, and many editorial boards have echoed the thoughts of the cleveland plain dealer: “...government information ought to be made available to the public as quickly as possible, with a minimum of rigmarole and in the easiest, most accessible way possible--which these days means via the internet.” we agree--and what better way to celebrate sunshine week than with leading thinkers on government, media and citizen engagement on all sides of the political spectrum who feel the same? yesterday at our google d.c. office, the sunlight foundation announced its public=online campaign. it’s exciting to see growing support for transparency and to see the progress that’s been made in the last year alone. every day, through sites like data.gov and projects like open congress, omb watch and our public data explorer, more data is available online. but there’s still a gap between having access to government data and easily understanding what it means. to help fill this gap, google has partnered with the sunlight foundation in its design for america contest to make government data more comprehensible to the public. you can learn more and get started on the contest homepage. there’s room for all kinds of folks to participate, and we can’t think of a more fun way to keep the spirit of sunshine week going.
Male: 100%, Female, students excavate a kiln at cheung ek, cambodia. photo courtesy of phon kaseka cheung ek is infamous for being the site of a khmer rouge killing field—some 20,000 cambodians were murdered here between 1975 and 1979. yet cheung ek also has a much older history, and today a team of archaeologists led by phon kaseka of the royal academy of cambodia is investigating what lies beneath this once horrifying landscape. the team has found that cheung ek was settled around 300 b.c. and played an important part in the emergence of southeast asia’s first great economy, the mysterious indian-influenced civilization known as funan. centered in the lower mekong floodplain, funan flourished from about the first to the sixth century and eventually gave rise to the well-known kingdom of angkor, which culminated in the 13th century. according to kyle latinis of the university of cambodia, “cheung ek may be one of the pinnacles” in a complex of sites. both roman and chinese historical texts record trade voyages to funan, and archaeologists have uncovered artifacts from rome, persia, india, and greece at the funan port town of oc eo, now located in southern vietnam. archaeologists also have investigated another important funan site, angkor borei, in southern cambodia. kaseka’s team is just beginning to investigate cheung ek, but it has already discovered 61 pottery kilns strung out over a distance of three miles (five kilometers). the kilns have been carbon-dated to between the fifth and seventh centuries, making them the oldest uncovered so far in this part of southeast asia. if the kilns were all used around the same time, that would support the idea that cheung ek was a major pottery producer—and therefore critical to funan’s economy. local potters likely made several kinds of pots, including spouted vessels called kendi, which were used for storing and pouring water, perhaps in ritual ceremonies. archaeologists can learn a remarkable amount about ancient technology and trade from studying kilns and the waste that can be recovered from them, such as clay debris and pots broken during manufacture. by examining the chemical composition of the clay debris and then testing kendi pots from the same time period that have been recovered at sites across southeast asia, the team hopes to determine the extent of cheung ek’s trade network. like many other funan-period sites, cheung ek may have continued to be occupied after the decline of funan and well into the era of angkor. a mysterious large, almost perfectly circular earthwork dates from at least the tenth century, and the team is testing several hypotheses as to its design and purpose. work has yielded stone inscriptions, architecture, brick temple or shrine foundations, and other features characteristic of later periods. kaseka’s team is eager to continue excavating the site’s kilns, temples, and houses, but it faces difficulties. cambodia is recovering from its violent past under pol pot and the khmer rouge, but the recovery process is proving detrimental to the nation’s cultural heritage. growth has been rapid and often uncontrolled, and the external demand for marketable artifacts has intensified. urbanization and looting are destroying cheung ek's history. “action needs to be taken now,” says kaseka. as part of a new generation of cambodian scholars, kaseka wants any fieldwork plans to include community education, and he wants to find ways to persuade developers and looters not to destroy the site or any others like it. sections of cheung ek have been preserved as a site museum, a memorial to the horrors of the killing fields. now efforts are being made to preserve the parts of this site that could reveal so much about cambodia’s distant past. 
Male: 94%, Male, in case you have broken legs or are allergic to joy or something and you can't leave your house this beautiful weekend, we suggest you catch up with breaking bad in time for the third season premiere on sunday. let's just put it up front: i know we had a big old bb takeover on this here webbersite just yesterday, but this has nothing to do with that. i genuinely happen to like something that our ad people took money from. why do i like it so much? well, it's smart and exciting and moving without showing any of the pesky nuts and bolts of what make a show smart and exciting and moving. you know how on mad men sometimes, just sometimes, you can almost see the writers straining to get that story arc so perfectly crafted? that doesn't happen on breaking bad, probably because by design it's smaller, lower to the ground, scruffier. it's a show about a guy dying of cancer who starts cooking meth to leave his family with some money and is therefore about big things like death & dying and the drug trade in the american southwest, but it's also maybe the most quietly pro-family (in the good way) show on the air. it's got a deep and satisfying and thoroughly realistic humanity to it that makes you feel like you're watching friends, people you know. which makes it all the more shocking when the drugs and the guns and the bodies start piling up.
Male: 100%, Male, back in january, we called tina fey “the first true female woody allen” — and quickly added, “which is not to discount cathy guisewite and her clear influence on 30 rock.” and wouldn’t you know it: last night, when liz lemon ran into her starchy anti-husband wesley (last name snipes) at a showing of hot tub time machine (nice product placement! we’re totally seeing that), their inevitable bickering led wesley to compare liz’s life to “something out of a cathy cartoon — it just won’t end.” now, comparing 30 rock to cathy isn’t exactly obscure or brilliant, but to do it in such a terrific episode — really, a cathy parody — reminds us of just how sharp this show remains. things got off to a lightning-paced start, with jack’s company-wide meeting that devolved, randomly and almost immediately, into city rivalries, with boston-bred jack throwing a battery at liz in return for her philly snowball, and all of it culminating in jenna shoving a man away from the mike and breaking out into “amazing grace.” the stories that followed — jack trying to fit in at kabletown (and suggesting “porn for women,” meh), liz contemplating wesley (snipes) for a “settling soul mate,” and tracy dealing with the world’s discovery of his fidelity to his wife — were all quite comfortably situated in the show’s wheelhouse, but great vehicles for the gags, a few of which we can’t resist bullet-pointing here. • tracy’s ben and jerry’s flavor, “adultaraisin.” • tracy’s post headline, “old faithful.” • the glimpse of the lesbian and the hasid canoodling in the dentist’s recovery room. • jenna confusing tiger woods and o.j. simpson. yikes! • jack “the master baiter” donaghy • “i innovate products.” • don geiss encased in carbonite. • and greatest of all, fresh ass: based on the novel tush by assfire read more: 30 rock recap: gangway for foot cycle! -- vulture http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/03/30_rock_recap_gangway_for_foot.html#ixzz0idh4vh9o 
Male: 100%, Female, new rules took effect february in delaware governing the arbitration of business disputes in the delaware court of chancery. the rules implement amendments to delaware law, adopted last year, granting the chancery court jurisdiction to arbitrate certain business disputes, and compliment rules already in place governing the court’s mediation of business and technology disputes. under the new law, the court of chancery has jurisdiction to arbitrate “business disputes,” which would include most complex corporate and commercial disputes. at least one of the parties must be a business entity, and at least one must be organized under delaware law or have its principal place of business in delaware. no party can be a consumer. in a claim exclusively for monetary damages, the amount in controversy must be at least $1 million. all parties must consent to the arbitration. arbitration in the court of chancery can have numerous advantages over litigation or other forms of arbitration, in that it provides prompt and confidential resolution by an experienced and sophisticated arbitrator. the arbitration will be heard by either a judge or master sitting permanently in the court of chancery. the petition and all subsequent arbitration proceedings are confidential, and are not included in the court’s pubic docketing system (unless there is an appeal). a preliminary conference will be held within 10 days of the filing of a petition, with a final hearing taking place within 90 days of the filing. selection of arbitration in the delaware chancery court may be appropriate for many complex commercial ventures and arrangements among u.s. entities, as well as those involving non-u.s. entities, often presenting the most straightforward, predictable and efficient form of dispute resolution, including for buy-sell arrangements, purchase price adjustments, governance disputes in joint ventures, and a wide variety of similar situations. litigation, in delaware and elsewhere, will continue to be a feature of disputes involving public company merger and acquisition transactions and governance matters, and planning for stockholder litigation in particular is a crucial part of transactional and governance preparedness. but serious thought should be given to selecting arbitration in the delaware chancery court as a dispute resolution mechanism for other forms of corporate and commercial disputes, both in transactions and more generally. 
Male: 100%, Male, "architectural design is always about the future; when architects make a proposition they always assume that it takes place in some imagined future. architects nearly always assume that this future will be ‘better’ than the present, often as a consequence of what is being proposed. architecture is, by its very nature, utopian. contemporary architecture, unlike earlier models of ‘utopian’ architecture, or perhaps because of the stigma attached to those models, has resisted an explicitly social and political agenda. instead it has become driven by ‘ideal’ formalist agendas facilitated by the ‘shape-making’ potential of new computer-based design tools and funded by speculative finance. indeed, the most important transformations that have occurred in architecture over the last 30 years have not been in the shifts in fashion marking out new typologies, new forms of representation, new materials or new forms of manufacture; the biggest single shift has been in the new economic relations within the building industry and the new forms of contractual relationships that this has brought about. the rise of fast-track construction in the 1980s heralded a major change in the motivations for construction and brought about a homogenisation of building output largely predicated on maximising the economic value of the project, often with little regard for its social value. and with the introduction of the private finance initiative (pfi) the current uk government has turned even health-care and educational building programmes into a speculative enterprise. pfi has always been presented as a cost-effective way of financing large infrastructural projects; however, like the government’s recent bail out of the banks, it works on the principle of the public financing the risk while the private sector skims off the profit.[3] for a number of years the single model that has shaped the type of future that the architectural profession has based its assumptions on is one of unfettered consumer expansion. the majority of recent architectural debates have not tried to call into question the economic imperatives of late capitalism that drive financial speculation and generate the context within which private development is presented as the only option. even the avant-garde architectural firms of the 1980s are now operating as large international commercial practices, and the deconstructivists have proved to be more than enthusiastic capitalists. the critical and intellectual ambitions inspired by jacques derrida, gilles deleuze and guy debord have been replaced with the monetarist ideologies of milton friedman and alan greenspan. the architectural profession has embraced the late capitalist model enthusiastically and uncritically, while all the time pandering to the concepts of social and environmental responsibility. the fact is that this model has been funded through speculative investment, and now that the money has run out the profession is bereft of alternatives." 
Male: 100%, Female, its not particularly hard to lose a messaging war against republicans. i mean, you aren't working against the kind of sophisticated public relations machine typically reserved for say, a kardashian. you're not even handling a hot potato. if it weren't for the lucky strike of stumbling into a minority by nominating a candidate who, up close, appeared to be melting, republicans wouldn't even be able to consider their drumbeat of "no!" much of a message at all. putting aside the deep irony - nancy pelosi and henry waxman both filed amicus briefs when ralph nader challenged the constitutionality of the so-called "slaughter rule" - democratic leaders immediately fell prey to the only response "deem"-ing a bill passed can possibly elicit. no. seriously. wtf (followed, as usual, by "tea party," but that's another story for another day). don't get me wrong. i'd be happy to adopt a "deem" and "pass" approach to almost anything. louboutains too expensive? i deem them passed into my closet. parking too tough? i deem and pass my double parking into legitimacy. deeming and passing a flurry of ideas would not only ensure that the world bows to my dominion, but would, frankly, make congress more effective. but call me skeptical that an $800+ billion spending bill should be deemed to have passed just like that. beyond feeling powerless in the whole matter, i feel like i should have the right to know if my congressman decided, for example, to have his vote purchased with earmark spending or a lobbyist-sponsored "fact-finding" trip to the caymans. not to mention, the current bill happens to be unpopular. which presents a problem. the real solution would be to go back to the drawing board and draft a bill we can all live with, but that involves work - which people get themselves elected to congress to avoid - and if they spend more than one more week addressing health care as opposed to, say, dramatic job losses, congress will see its approval rating sink even lower...perhaps to the level of their kardashian rivals. so faced with a decision - significant work or pass an unpopular bill through a back door method that people don't quite understand - democrats chose the latter.
Female: 100%, Male, here's an equation i bet you've never seen in a math class: buick lacrosse + providence at lunchtime = serious sandwiches. let me explain. alaina and i cruised out of boston at around 11:30. our plan: head to providence for a mini sandwich tour. (that'd be a limited tour of providence sandwiches—not a tour of providence mini-sandwiches.) i've been hearing a lot about the sandwiches made and sold at the the food store-cum-cheese shop farmstead, by husband and wife chef team matt and kate jennings (owners of the highly regarded bistro la laiterie). i figured that we would take our sandwiches and eat them in our roomy lacrosse as we made our way to our second providence sandwich shop, hewtin's mobile hot dog truck, owned by another providence based husband and wife team—matthew and kristin gennuso of chez pascal. what better time to visit a food truck in new england than on a sunny day in mid-march, with wheels at your disposal? and since we'd left carey behind in boston, we rendezvoused with one of our terrific serious eats interns, brown student leah douglas. sounds like a pretty cool itinerary, doesn't it? when we arrived at farmstead, it turned out there was seating available at la laiterie, so we were able to enjoy a leisurely lunch utilizing real tables and chairs. as is our wont, we ordered just about every sandwich on the menu. the highlights? the cheesemonger's grilled cheese was in fact made in a sandwich press rather than grilled. i don't even know what cheeses were in it, but there was definitely something cheddar-y in there because the sandwich had that primordial cheddar ooze. add in a helpful (if a little disorganized) staff that was eager to please and you end up with a fine lunch first course.
Male: 100%, Female, if i’m being completely honest, i’d have to say that my quest to cut down on my multitasking has really been in vain. i really just don’t think it’s in my nature to only do one thing at a time. i try, but i get bored or i feel guilty that i should be doing more. my addiction to technology doesn’t help either and neither does that the fact that i’m a workaholic. i mix work with play all the time & play with work. not to mention trying to fit in family friends in between errands and new projects i start. i came upon this whole goal of reducing multitasking thinking it might cut down on my stress, but i think it’s making me more stressed thinking about all the shit i have to do! added to the stress factor, i also heard a few reports on npr about how multitasking can make your brain less effective, but so does a glass of wine and i’m not giving that up! oh, why can’t i be happy doing less? i have these notions of mediating and being more in the moment, but both of those things just seem to yet another thing to add to my to-do list. what about you? am i along in this quest or are you all struggling with the idea of trying to lead a simpler less harried life only to be thwarted by yourself? i am on the search for a virtual intern for summer 2010. responsibilities will include: 1. conducting research for stories. 2. help me coordinate a variety of projects—which will mostly involve contacting artists, scheduling & organizing details. 3. respond to email! 4. writing assignments…both assigned and those based on your own interests. 5. other stuff that comes up. workload will be about 8-10 hours a week and there is absolutely no pay, but the glory, oh the glory… if you are interested, email me at jen@indiefixx.com with a brief note about why you are interested in being my intern and a resume as well. please feel free to pass this on to anyone who may be interested. for a student, i’d be happy to write a letter of recommendation after a successful internship. i’d also be happy to promote projects that the intern may be working on personally. i will collect resumes until may 15th and get back to those who i’d like to interview after that. please note that this is a virtual internship, so your location does not matter, but you must be super self-motivated.
Male: 100%, Male,  apple will be hosting a webkit contributors meeting at its campus in cupertino, ca on monday, april 12 and tuesday, april 13 from 9am to 6pm pdt. the meeting is targeted at contributors to the webkit open source project. the meeting will have an “unconference”-like format, allowing plenty of time for impromptu sessions/discussions and hacking. a new mailing list, webkit-meeting, will be used for general discussion and to communicate additional information about the meeting. you can subscribe at lists.webkit.org. questions may also be sent to adele peterson at adele at webkit.org. the meeting will be free of charge. all webkit contributors are encouraged to attend. however, space is limited, so registrations will be accepted on a first come, first served basis. please register for the meeting using the meeting registration form by thursday, april 1. we hope to see you there! daniel has made many valuable contributions to webkit including additions to the xssauditor, which helps prevent reflective cross site scripting attacks, as well as numerous changes to drag and drop ensuring that webkit complies with the html5 spec. of course, all of this was supported with thorough tests and improvements to webkit’s testing harness. recently, daniel has been working on features for mobile devices such as a cross platform patch to enable faster mobile scrolling on pages with static background images. please join me in congratulating daniel on his reviewer status! nate got his start in webkit with helping to upstream javascript bindings for the chromium port into webkit. during that work, he learned much about webkit style as well as getting to know the bindings quite well. since then, he continued to do a prodigious amount with the bindings and improved them in many ways. in addition, he also added noreferrer support and fixed bugs in a variety of areas such as the loader and plugin scripting. please join me in congratulating nate on his reviewer status! jeremy has done a lot of work on local storage and session storage within webkit. much of this brought it up to date with spec changes, but he also improved it by adding quota support and fixing many bugs. as part of the chromium port, he also worked on its webkit api and javascript bindings. please join me in congratulating jeremy on his reviewer status!

Male: 100%, Male, "the word blog is a conflation of two words: web and log. it contains in its four letters a concise and accurate self-description: it is a log of thoughts and writing posted publicly on the world wide web. in the monosyllabic vernacular of the internet, web log soon became the word blog. this form of instant and global self-publishing, made possible by technology widely available only for the past decade or so, allows for no retroactive editing (apart from fixing minor typos or small glitches) and removes from the act of writing any considered or lengthy review. it is the spontaneous expression of instant thought—impermanent beyond even the ephemera of daily journalism. it is accountable in immediate and unavoidable ways to readers and other bloggers, and linked via hypertext to continuously multiplying references and sources. unlike any single piece of print journalism, its borders are extremely porous and its truth inherently transitory. the consequences of this for the act of writing are still sinking in. a ship’s log owes its name to a small wooden board, often weighted with lead, that was for centuries attached to a line and thrown over the stern. the weight of the log would keep it in the same place in the water, like a provisional anchor, while the ship moved away. by measuring the length of line used up in a set period of time, mariners could calculate the speed of their journey (the rope itself was marked by equidistant “knots” for easy measurement). as a ship’s voyage progressed, the course came to be marked down in a book that was called a log. in journeys at sea that took place before radio or radar or satellites or sonar, these logs were an indispensable source for recording what actually happened. they helped navigators surmise where they were and how far they had traveled and how much longer they had to stay at sea. they provided accountability to a ship’s owners and traders. they were designed to be as immune to faking as possible. away from land, there was usually no reliable corroboration of events apart from the crew’s own account in the middle of an expanse of blue and gray and green; and in long journeys, memories always blur and facts disperse. a log provided as accurate an account as could be gleaned in real time. as you read a log, you have the curious sense of moving backward in time as you move forward in pages—the opposite of a book. as you piece together a narrative that was never intended as one, it seems—and is—more truthful. logs, in this sense, were a form of human self-correction. they amended for hindsight, for the ways in which human beings order and tidy and construct the story of their lives as they look back on them. logs require a letting-go of narrative because they do not allow for a knowledge of the ending. so they have plot as well as dramatic irony—the reader will know the ending before the writer did." 
Male: 100%, Female, for the millions of people in japan who spend too much time at work to have pets, a social life, or a partner, help is at hand. it started with tokyo's cat cafés, where customers can sit around and sip coffee—and also rent a cat, for 10 bucks an hour. with japan's economy in deep recession, cuddles are clearly in demand; customers ranging from schoolgirls to engineers are flocking to businesses such as neko no mise ("cat store"). clients receive a "menu" of the felines available for petting; balls of wool and plastic mice are complimentary. the cat cafés have become so popular that more than 150 businesses have sprung up to offer animals for hire—ferrets, turtles, squirrels, monkeys--on an hourly, weekly, or even monthly basis, if you want to bring the critter home. dogs are predictably popular, but for those with a smaller apartment and budget, beetles are an option. one agency has taken the idea of renting whatever makes your life complete a step further. hagemashi tai ("i want to cheer up limited") rents out relatives. whether it's for a wedding or funeral, you can choose the perfect person to accompany you, rather than go solo. the agency also offers a service to single mothers seeking a male role model for their children. the "father" will attend school events, take the kid to the park, help with homework. kikue shimizu, 37, has a weekly arrangement with just such a rent-a-dad. "my two boys are growing up without a father figure in their lives," she says. "i need someone who can talk to them about their education, their futures." to be sure, the tradition of paying someone to be nice to you has a long history in japan, dating back to the dawn of the geisha. consequently, there's no stigma attached to the fact that the so-called cousin at your side is clocking up the yen by the hour. 
Male: 100%, Male, outfitted with burly outsoles, waterproof materials, and big toe guards, trail shoes are built to bring you closer to nature. as the following reviews indicate, not every trail shoe is perfect for every off-road outing. some are built low and feature sticky treads that grip mucky footpaths and shale-strewn climbs. others have smaller treads and thicker cushioning more appropriate for less-rugged terrain. to determine how they measure up, we analyzed each shoe at the rw shoe lab and tested them on the feet of more than 200 runners. we found these nine shoes to be the best for tackling the trails. we say this is one of the few trail shoes with enough cushioning to handle long stretches of road and still provide sure footing on loose terrain and mud, thanks to its deep lugs. it also features a grippy edge in the heel that helps maintain traction going downhill. rw shoe lab tests show the shoe's heel and forefoot to be among the softest in this guide. all this cushioning results in a bulkier-than average midsole that some testers felt lifted them too high off the ground. recommended for trail runners who frequently mix in some roads and don't want to sacrifice off-road traction. wear-tester says "i liked the traction, but the heel felt high."—jenna druver, 32, east lansing 
Male: 100%, Male, i can respect conservatives who can respect liberals. i can work with conservatives who are willing to work with progressives. if your goal is to move america rather than your party forward, than i'd like to shake your hand and find a way to do it together. what i cannot respect are people who think it's painfully obvious that their beliefs are the one and only definition of "right" or of "american." i cannot abide for half a second those people who think anyone even half an inch different than they are unpatriotic, socialist, elitist, stupid, or undeserving. and that is why i loathe glenn beck and the tea party movement. you think government is too big? okay, i get that. you think the president is taking us down a bad path? i disagree, but whatever. you believe congress is broken? who doesn't. you think black people who dare to disagree with you are soviet kenyan n------s who gas jews? well in that case, you represent none of the best and all of the worst of american history, you racist, uninformed, self-righteous, cowardly, unpatriotic, anarchist halfwit toads. roll call reports: do these addle-brained huns really think they’re going to change anyone’s mind with racist name calling? do you they honestly think that this tripe passes for factual discourse? as conservative joe scarborough tweets, "john lewis is a friend, a great man and an american hero. anyone attacking such a man with racial slurs has a dark heart and a grim soul." and "also, the attacks against barney frank were hateful and outrageous. barney and i usually disagreed in congress but he loves his country."
Male: 100%, Male,  lancs are through to barbados t20 semi posted by graham.hardcastle for world of sport lancashire have just sneaked through to finals day of the twenty20 competition at the kensington oval in barbados. the red rose county were made to work hard with the bat in their pursuit of 131 against a select xi from the host island, but tom smith’s 48 was the mainstay of their reply. the lightning won with three wickets and two balls to spare. the left-hander looked upset at being given out caught behind when the ball seemed to loop up off his pad onto his gloves and through to the keeper. i remember him telling me last year that he was gutted not to be there at the end of a win against glamorgan at the swalec after doing all the hard work, and this was a similar circumstance. lancashire will now play essex in the first semi-final early evening your time back home (5.30pm), while roses rivals yorkshire were the shock losers of the day. they went down by 58 runs to a university of the west indies xi after being bowled out for 63!! there were a couple of hundred spectators throughout the day at the impressive kensington oval, and there are a few more expected for the finals day tomorrow due to the fact that there is some home presence in the students. there was a little bit of a worry for the lightning, with skipper glen chapple taking a bang on his finger during fielding. he only bowled two overs before leaving the field and letting mark chilton take over the leadership duties. chappie came back out to bat later on to help guide his side over the winning line, but peter moores said afterwards that he might not be fit to play in the semi and hopefully final of the barbados cricket cup. i remember the ex-england man tearing a hamstring in sharjah last pre-season, but this injury doesn’t sound anywhere near as serious. 
Male: 100%, Male, on march 12th, matt damon and director paul greengrass will be together again in theaters for their latest action thriller, “green zone,” a film set in the chaotic early days of the iraqi war when no one could be trusted and every decision could detonate unforeseen consequences. damon and greengrass have clearly proven that they’ve got chemistry, what with their work together on “the bourne supremacy” and “the bourne ultimatum,” and we’re obviously looking forward to checking it out, but…well, here’s the thing: damon’s a great action hero, but he can be pretty hilarious, too, and “green zone” doesn’t exactly look like what you’d call a laff riot. 1. glory daze (1996): okay, we’ll be honest with you: damon’s barely in this film. it’s really a vehicle for his longtime buddy, ben affleck, who sports some seriously douche-tastic facial hair throughout the film. although the remarkable number of recognizable faces to be found within the cast make it worth checking out (sam rockwell, alyssa milano, matthew mcconaughey, john rhys-davies, kristin bauer, french stewart, brendan fraser, leah remini, meredith salinger, mary woronov, and spaulding gray all make appearances), the predominant reason we’ve included “glory daze” – which is, for the record, explores the hesitation all college graduates experience before entering the real world – is because no matter how many films he may eventually have to his credit, matt damon should never be allowed to escape the fact that, even though it was only for a few fleeting moments, he once played a character named edward pudwacker.
Male: 100%, Male, to me, one of the most enjoyable parts of a baseball card is not so much the player, but what's in the background of the photo. it's especially fun when an old advertisement takes a prominent spot, like this one of bill fahey from 1973 topps. (in fact, 1973 topps may contain the greatest photo backgrounds of any set, ever, but that's a topic for another post.) in plain sight to the left of fahey there's an ad for the fine dining and cocktail options available at harris' imperial house in boca raton, florida. the card also features an ad for fowlkes chevrolet, which, judging from information available on the web, may or may not be related in some way with mayes chevrolet, which had been on the former storyland park property in broward county, florida (pompano beach: a history). next time you're going through your cards, find a good one with a prominent ad in the background of the player photo and post a scan on the baseball card blog's facebook page. i bet we'll get a great gallery going. 
Female: 100%, Female, it's always such an encouragement to see other families dealing with sid. my son (6yrs) was diagnosed with sid with speech/language delay when he was 2. we've been in heavy (and expensive) therapy since then. before kindergarden, when we were seeing very little improvement from the ot, he was also diagnosed with adhd. as what i felt was a last resort, we chose to try medication (a patch–daytrana–that administers meds only when on). i was so concerned about how he would be able to function in a classroom setting. for you doctors and researchers out there, i think this is worth noting: my son's speech was pretty bad. low understanding of language, and an often flipping of phrases–almost as if every sentence was a word scramble with conjunctions rarely used. within 3 hours of administering his first patch, my son began talking at lightning speed, and fully correct! it was as if a knotted ball of string that once was his words and thoughts had been pulled straight. it was amazing ! and he seemed to know that he was speaking correctly. he talked for about 8 hours straight. for the first time, words were coming out the way he meant them. the medication hasn't been a cure-all, but it has enabled him to focus on his work and sit still at school, follow complex instructions from parents and teachers, and helped him with social interaction. i know that's not what some of you want to hear, but i think research needs to be done on how adhd meds can benefit sid kids.
Male: 100%, Male, this is a totally different way from thinking about things than i think we see nowadays. i kind of liken it to how i tell students not to program. if you're implementing something moderately complex (say, forward/backward algorithm), first write down all the math, then start implementing. don't start implementing first. i think nowadays (and sure, i'm guilty!) we see a lot of implementing without the math. or rather, with plenty of math, but without a representational model of what it is that we're studying. the central claim of the rst paper is that one can think of texts as being organized into elementary discourse units, and these are connected into a tree structure by relations like the one above. (or at least this is my reading of it.) that is, they have laid out a representation of text and claimed that this is how texts get put together. as a second example (this will be sorter), take wendy lehnert's 1982 paper, "plot units and narrative summarization." here, the story is about how stories get put together. the most interesting thing about the plot units model to me is that it breaks from how one might naturally think about stories. that is, i would naively think of a story as a series of events. the claim that lehnert makes is that this is not the right way to think about it. rather, we should think about stories as sequences of affect states. effectively, an affect state is how a character is feeling at any time. (this isn't quite right, but it's close enough.) for example, lehnert presents the following story: when john tried to start his care this morning, it wouldn't turn over. he asked his neighbor paul for help. paul did something to the carburetor and got it going. john thanked paul and drove to work. 
Male: 94%, Female, thank you for all who voted in the poll. eighty-one percent of you believe i should put ads on the blog. i'm going to wait and see. reasons are: 1) ads don't jive with the purpose of the blog i've started this "guerilla" undercover lunch project... and then you guys, my readers, get some weird off-beat goo*gle ads, which most likely will have nothing to do with what i'm doing here. 2) donations and transparency i love the idea of making a donation to a farm-to-school initiative and i may just do that on my own time. but if i set up ads, how do i do that? with my real name? and ssn#? and then i'm assuming i get the ad check directly, which then i have to deposit and then turn around and donate. basically, i can't make it go from blog to organization unless i put a donate button. i haven't done enough research into specific organizations and i don't want it to look like i'm endorsing some over others. so now is not the right time. 3) lack of time i don't have very much time what with working, family life, and running our home. if running ads even adds just 10 minutes per day of extra work, i honestly don't have that time. i'm already going to bed way later than usual because of the project. i just can't do any more than i'm already doing. i can barely find time to read all of your excellent comments! *** i was thinking that if i decide to go with ads, i could donate the ad revenue to my school when/if i get found out. i think i'm going to get "busted" one day and i'm unsure of what ramifications there would be. but if i could off-set the bad press with a little ad revenue for my school, that could be a nice way to smooth things over. 
Female: 100%, Female, i am a flight att. and waitress and single mom. i work like a dog.i had been hurting for months and then began swelling and having red joints. in april i was diagnosed with ra and the doctor prescribed humira. i had been taking voltaren which mad no difference. anyway, i was worried about the side effect of a lowered immune system. so far, no colds, but i cut my hands at work(paper cuts) and they become angry and swollen, not healing at all. i also experienced complete numbness in both arms and hands the night after my second injection. has anyone else taken humira? how is your immunity? my joints and pain are so much better. only 2 fingers still swollen and red. i have to be able to stand 13-14 hrs about 6 days a week. please let me know about humira….thanks.
Female: 100%, Female, it sounds like that is what you have. i have achalasia. i am 26. i had surgery on the 6th of this month. you need to bring up achalasia to your doctors. it is a progressive disease---so yes, unfortunately it has gotten worse with age. they might suggest botox injections since you are a little older than myself but they might also suggest surgery---mine was done through my stomach----opposed to open surgery---i am still recovering but i believe that i will be fine---the only thing is that if you do the surgery do not do the botox treatments---it can cause scar tissue making the surgery more risky than it already is. i had one botox treatment a year ago to alleviate some of the symptoms---but the scar tissue was there and things could have gone very badly. please heed my advice and call your doctor!
Male: 100%, Male, i finished k-means and gaussian mixture models in class last week or maybe the week before. i've previously discussed the fact that these two are really solving different problems (despite being structurally so similar), but today's post is about something different. there are two primary differences between the typical presentation of k-means and the typical presentation of gmms. (i say "typical" because you can modify these algorithms fairly extensively as you see fit.) the first difference is that gmms just have more parameters. the parameters of k-means are typically the cluster assignments ("z") and the means ("mu"). the parameters of a gmm are typically these (z and mu) as well as the class prior probabilities ("pi") and cluster covariances ("sigma"). the gmm model is just richer. of course, you can restrict it so all clusters are isotropic and all prior probabilities are even, in which case you've effectively removed this difference (or you can add these things into k-means). the second difference is that gmms operate under the regime of "soft assignments," meaning that points aren't wed to clusters: they only prefer (in a probabilistic sense) some clusters to others. this falls out naturally from the em formalization, where the soft assignments are simply the expectations of the assignments under the current model. one can get rid of the second difference by running "hard em" (also called "viterbi em" in nlp land), where the expectations are clamped at their most likely value. this leads to something that has much more of a k-means feel. this "real em" versus "hard em" distinction comes up a lot in nlp, where computing exact expectations is often really difficult. (sometimes you get complex variants, like the "pegging" approaches in the ibm machine translation models, but my understanding from people who run in this circle is that pegging is much ado about nothing.) my general feeling has always been "if you don't have much data, do real em; if you have tons of data, hard em is probably okay." (this is purely from a practical perspective.) the idea is that when you have tons and tons of data, you can approximate expectations reasonably well by averaging over many data points. (yes, this is hand-wavy and it's easy to construct examples where it fails. but it seems to work many times.) of course, you can get pedantic and say "hard em sucks: it's maximizing p(x,z) but i really want to maximize p(x)" to which i say: ho hum, who cares, you don't actually care about p(x), you care about some extrinsic evaluation metric which, crossing your fingers, you hope correlates with p(x), but for all i know it correlates better with p(x,z). nevertheless, a particular trusted friend has told me he's always remiss when he can't do full em and has to do hard em: he's never seen a case where it doesn't help. (or maybe "rarely" would be more fair.) of course, this comes at a price: for many models, maximization (search) can be done in polynomial time, but computing expectations can be #p-hard (basically because you have to enumerate -- or count -- over every possible assignment). now let's think about approximate inference in graphical models. let's say i have a graphical model with some nodes i want to maximize over (call them "x") and some nodes i want to marginalize out (call them "z"). for instance, in gmms, the x nodes would be the means, covariances and cluster priors; the z nodes would be the assignments. (note that this is departing slightly from typical notation for em.) suppose i want to do inference in such a model. here are three things i can do: 
Female: 100%, Female, i was planning today to write about how ricki hasn't stolen borekas for a whole week or so. progress. (grin) real progress. don't worry- she didn't. but imagine my happy balloon deflating as i saw ricki extracting my very expensive camera from her school bag this afternoon. in the morning i had caught a shot of her frying an egg (i'll post it tomorrowhopefully), although by the time i had fetched the camera, the shot was not as good as what i had wanted to photograph. then i must have left it in sight, and ricki simply gave herself permission to make off with it, and took some 50 pictures at school today. i am only happy that the camera came back in one piece….and that she isn't (hopefully) stealing borekas.
Male: 100%, Female, got an email yesterday from a friend, with a link to an article about recent changes over at google. seems the search giant has yet again tweaked its search functionality. such news always alarms me, as i teach internet search and this usually means extra work. this time, though, the change is a small one. according to cbc news, google is combining its multiple search offerings (web, images, blogs, etc.) into a single "universal search". the change is only evident at google.com (not the various international flavours of google) and pretty superficial, from the user's perspective anyway. a few sample images and news search results — if there are any — have been rolled into the web search results list. google also now offers the ability to narrow by related search. the various search types (which were displayed immediately above the search field) are now at the top left of your screen. additional search types are available through a dropdown instead of a link to a separate page and they are reduced in number. compare for yourself. here's google.com and here's the canadian variant. i can't quite see the point of this. but oh well. it's not earth-shattering. 
Female: 98%, Male, i always wanted to have a nickname. something that had to do with an experience, or perhaps from not being able to pronounce my name correctly as a child, or even something wildly nonsensical that had nothing to do with anything. like crime dog. in the grand scheme of things, crime dog isn't bad (for those not in the know, it refers to macgruff, the bloodhound in the trenchcoat who encouraged kids on saturday morning to 'take a bite out of crime'), though slightly bizarre. it's better than being referred to as three-finger or stumpy. plus it shortens easily to 'dog.' as in, 'dog, you can carve the turkey' or 'hurry dog, cut the red wire. no no, the red one!' but that's just the thing about nicknames: you don't decide if you get one; someone else does. and though most baseball nicknames derive from the player's last name, i would bet that crime dog was the product of nickname evolution. you don't just wake up one morning with a nickname epiphany (unless your name is shaquille o'neal). so unless i become a gangster, a character on a tv show, or join a baseball team, i'm resigned to spend my life as ben. not piano legs or baby face. just ben. only, simply ben. i guess it could be worse. at least i won't be called steve urkel for the rest of my life. 
Female: 100%, Female, i'd just like to say that i've really enjoyed reading the comments. thank you. i love reading your personal stories about school lunches. i also see a lot of opinions about the photos and about food options in your children's schools. and every commenter who tells me to keep going is also appreciated. the best part of the comments is that we are opening a dialogue about school lunches in our country. *** and i've done another email interview. this time with mother nature network : an interview with school lunch blogger mrs. q thanks robin! *** i think when we look at under-performing schools and we want to change those numbers, we need to question everything. teachers' skills, abilities, and training are often addressed in the media as a big part of the picture. you know, i attend quality professional development activities through my district every 1-2 months depending on the schedule. that's pretty darn good if you ask me. i always learn something new. but nowhere have i ever seen anyone think about what we offer children for lunch. let's think about what we give students to ingest. for instance, i personally enjoy eating hot dogs maybe every 4-6 months, mostly in the summer cooked on a grill. also i eat them when i go to the ballpark as a special treat. but i wonder if we should give a child a hot dog lunch and then ask them to take the isat (state test)... *** in 2004 jamie oliver launched an effort to improve school lunches in the uk. he started a program called school dinners and he wrote a manifesto about what he wanted to see happen in the school lunch movement (i love the word "manifesto"). not all schools accepted his new program, but many did. in 2006-7, the institute for social and economic research (iser) at essex university comes along and decides to study 11-year-old kids who ate the new diet of fresh food for at least 12 months. results: an independent study shows the performance of 11-year-old pupils eating oliver's meals improved by up to 8% in science and as much as 6% in english, while absenteeism due to ill-health fell by 15%. the researchers controlled for other variables and compared the results to the schools where the kids did not have access to the fresh food. wow. that's all i can say. 
Female: 100%, Female, i've been inundated with emails and notes from various alzheimer's charities and groups about their promotions leading up to world alzheimer's day on september 21. we're right around the 2 year anniversary of when my dad was violently taken from the house after trying to kill my mom, and thus he started on the horrible spiral that led to his death 2 months later. i can't bear to read it again, maybe i never will, but if you are interested it starts here. i can't imagine when i will ever be able to look back at the months of september, october and november 2007 without pain. some days i can't even bear to think about my father. it's usually when i am alone, driving, when it hits me--a song on the radio, passing a store or restaurant he liked, or even a random chain of thoughts that leads me to think my dad was stolen from me and no matter what drugs they come up with now, i can never ever get him back. then i drive the long way home, until i finish crying. which is my excuse, i guess, for neglecting this blog. i think about writing, but it stirs everything up, and then i end up in front of my computer crying into my cat's fur. here are some of the campaigns that have been brought to my attention lately. if i missed yours, let me know!
Female: 100%, Female, today the kids and i had lunch at my inlaws house. sebastian was in a bad mood and kept grunting at anyone who disturbed him while he was eating. in an attempt to get sebasatian to verbalise his discontent we were encouraging him to say"go away". sebastian mimicked the words with litle enthusiasm however marcus on the other hand expressed this phrase with great enthusiam. he was so cute that we couldn't help but giggle and of course this lead to him repeating the words over and over again, causing us to laugh even harder. i knew that i would suffer the consequences of our collective actions and it was only 1 hour later when we were at the video shop and he walked away from me chanting "go away, go away, go away" oh the joys!!
Male: 100%, Male, just run max-product. that is, maximize p(x,z) rather than p(x). just run sum-product. that is, compute expectations over x and z, rather than just over z. run em, by alternating something like sum-product on z and something like max-product onx. of these, only (3) is really doing the "right thing." further, let's get away from the notion of p(x) not correlating with some extrinsic evaluation by just measuring ourselves against exact inference. (yes, this limits us to relatively small models with 10 or 20 binary nodes.) what do you think happens? well, first, things vary as a function of the number of x nodes versus z nodes in the graph. when most of the nodes are x (maximization) nodes, then max-product does best and em basically does the same. whe most of the nodes are z (marginalization) nodes, then em does best and sum-product does almost the same. but max product also does almost the same. this is an effect that we've been seeing regularly, regardless of what the models look like (chains or lattices), what the potentials look like (high temperature or low temperature) and how you initialize these models (eg., in the chain case, em converges to different places depending on initialization, while sum- and max-product do not). max product is just unbeatable. in a sense, from a practical perspective, this is nice. it says: if you have a mixed model, just run max product and you'll do just as well as if you had done something more complicated (like em). but it's also frustrating: we should be getting some leverage out of marginalizing over the nodes that we should marginalize over. especially in the high temperature case, where there is lots of uncertainty in the model, max product should start doing worse and worse (note that when we evaluate, we only measure performance on the "x" nodes -- the "z" nodes are ignored). likening this back to k-means versus gmm, for the case where the models are the same (gmm restricted to not have priors or covariances), the analogy is that as far as the means go, it doesn't matter which one you use. even if there's lots of uncertainty in the data. of course, you may get much better assignments from gmm (or you may not, i don't really know). but if all you really care about at the end of the day are the xs (the means), then our experience with max-product suggests that it just won't matter. at all. ever. part of me finds this hard to believe, and note that i haven't actually run experiments with k-means and gmm, but the results in the graphical model cases are sufficiently strong and reproducible that i'm beginning to trust them. shouldn't someone have noticed this before, though? for all the effort that's gone into various inference algorithms for graphical models, why haven't we ever noticed that you just can't beat max-product? (yes, i'm aware of some theoretical results, eg., the wainwright result that sum-product + randomized rounding is a provably good approximation to the map assignment, but this result actually goes the other way, and contradicts many of our experimental studies where sum-product + rounding just flat out sucks. maybe there are other results out there that we just haven't been able to dig up.) 
Female: 100%, Female, a quick update... 1. my husband's health is much, much better. despite the surgeon's ominous prediction that there would be no return of pituitary function, he now has almost full function. the endocrine system is doing great, except for a slightly sluggish thyroid. this is a huge answer to prayer, and i am thankful for all of you who prayed for us. 2. life has been busy. at times it has been both sad and stressful. i wrote, months ago, about "deep waters". while the waters are not quite as deep as they were, and we're not spending as much time in them, they're not exactly shallow yet either. 3. we are part of a wonderful fellowship of believers. i can't begin to describe what a blessing they has been. did i mention that these people are wonderful? 4. life has not been all stress and work. we've carved out time for fun and relaxation too, and made some hilarious family memories...and a few are even captured on video. 5. coffee is good. still. always. that is yet again proof that the natural order of the universe is still intact. 6. i saved the best for last: offspring #3 (aka, "the strapping young man") is engaged!! but it gets even better. he's not just engaged to anyone; he's engaged to a terrific young woman that people can't seem to say enough good things about. we love her! is that cool or what? 
Female: 99%, Male, there was a time early on in my days where i could jump out of bed and greet the world with tremendous vigor. there was a time early on in my life where my memory was sharp and clear. now i get out of bed gently, slowly and greet the world with “oh shit, my back”. my memory loss is apparent whenever i meet someone for the first time and they give me their name, only for me to forget it 10 seconds into the conversation. good times……..good times.
Female: 100%, Male, i don't know if it has something to do with all the medicine that i'm on, or the fact asthma causes some degree of stress, or the fact that i'm forced to be "unique" because of asthma, or due to anxiety, or sinus problems, or allergies, or wimpiness or what. but, i sometimes get these terrible headaches, and i have one right now. actually i have dulled it with an ultram, but it's still there. i woke up at 2 a.m. with this headache so bad there was no way i was going to go back to sleep, so i got up and took two 500 mg tylenol. i have to take that much, because one never quite cuts it. i knew this was not a tylenol headache, though. yet i had to try it. i had to try something before i took an ultram. i had to because once i take an ultram, once it kicks in, i have to write. doesn't that sound weird. yep! ultram relaxes me to the point, puts all these ideas in my head, and i have to put them on paper. i've written some good stuff while on ultram. ultram dulls or gets rid of my headaches no matter how bad, it's the first drug i have ever taken that gives me at least some degree of relief. however, even though it is not an opiate, and my doctor says it's safe to use it and work, it gives me the feeling that about three cups of coffee gives me, although without the side effects such as shakiness and such. it just makes me feel euphoric, and happy.
Female: 100%, Male, on friday evening, i found the mother lode of pain located – conveniently enough – in my right wrist. the most intense episode lasted about an hour. when it passed, i proudly reminded myself about how such episodes in the past used to emotionally knock me down for days, which did not seem to be the case anymore. sure, these episodes continue to be difficult to get through, but at least i seem to be a little more “prepared” for them. yesterday afternoon, when i was at physical therapy, we once again reached the point where the maximum electrotherapy current was being delivered to my ankles, and i couldn't feel a thing. in the past, i used to break down right at that moment, as it served as a objective and stark reminder of exactly how much pain i was in. yesterday, i held my head up high as i remembered this, and told myself that i would get through this episode as i have gotten through other episodes. later during the day, i completely lost the use of my left hand for more than an hour. as luck would have it, this coincided with the time when we sat down to eat a meal. in the past, i would have have been reluctant to ask for help and would have instead struggled to cut my own food, resulting in even more pain. yesterday, i calmly asked for help, and even through i am left-handed, i used my right hand to lift my fork. when a small glass of jello was served for dessert, i propped it up in between my knees and scooped it up with a spoon – without so much as a second thought. i once again felt proud of myself.
Male: 94%, Female, i do love shaun white. i love that he could have ridden down the center of the pipe and still taken gold, and yet, he put forth the ride of his life…and had fun…you nailed it…he has fun with what he does. i'm so bad, i don't know anyone's name…i just get a kick out of watching them all. i don't love watching hockey, though…because my personal belief is that nhl players shouldn't be in the olympics. i get why they opened it up to professional athletes…but i don't have to like it. i cheer for our american athletes…because i'm an american…but i can totally appreciate the fact the woman's snowboarder from australia put forth a better ride, and be happy for her. (i just would have been happier if an american woman had won) i also totally admire an athlete like the woman's skeleton rider, who had a horrific injury, and came back and was able to compete at the olympic level again.
Male: 100%, Male, over the past week i've received a lot of recommendations for keepers, so i thought i'd kick things off by talking about one of my favorite cards: 1960 leaf "baseball's two hal smiths". it's on my keeper list, and is a card i don't own. it's a keeper because it isn't clear what the two hal smiths are doing in their photo. are they negotiating over the bill? are they diapering a baby? because the background has been removed, context is missing (and desperately, desperately needed). these guys could be anywhere – a bus stop... a locker room... it's no secret, my love for 1960 leaf (read my set review here). the photos are mug-shot bad, the cards themselves came packaged with marbles, and the design has a style aesthetic with as much pizzazz as checkerboard kitchen linoleum. but what it's lacking in visual appeal, it more than makes up for in awkwardness. awkward halos behind each head. awkward checklist including immortal baseball gods stover mcilwain (out of the league since 1958), marshall renfroe (career = 1 game in 1959), and baseball's two hal smiths (one a journeyman, the other an all star). and did i mention that the cards were awkwardly packaged with marbles? i understand that topps had cornered the market on the cards and gum thing, but seriously, who came up with marbles? there's something about hal smith... both of him. i can't think of another time when two players shared the same name. (wait a minute... steve ontiveros? weren't there two of that guy?) i've mentioned this already, but one hal was a journeyman and the other hal was an all star. the all star had a knack for showing up on his baseball cards in full catcher regalia; that is, toothily smiling through his mask in a creepy crouching position. i can think of at least two cards (1958 topps and 1960 topps) of him photographed like that. the journeyman was just ugly: pursed lips, narrowed eyes... it was as if he was a street-corner criminal scouting for the next fence. this one is also a keeper for me because it's a combo card. but instead of hal and hal hamming it up under a corny line like "backstop buddies" or something, as topps was wont to do throughout the sixties, sports novelties kept it obvious, in a ripley's believe-it-or-not informative kind of way. it's "baseball's two hal smiths" because that's who they are. in the end it matters not what they're doing, just that they appear together. that's why this one's a keeper. 
Female: 100%, Female, today's menu: rotini, meat sauce, green beans, cherry-flavored icee, breadstick, butter, milk. i enjoyed this meal. the pasta and meat sauce weren't bad and i appreciated the variety of rotini (versus spaghetti). i guess the green beans had some kind of butter sauce. i didn't taste a sauce but there was a little buttery residue on the bottom of the paper package. the icee was very sweet. i sucked down a few sips and then stopped. i talked to a couple students about the meal. they said they liked it. i asked if they ate everything and one didn't eat the green beans. both didn't eat the breadsticks because they were "too busy talking" and ran out of time. in other news i have definitely determined i'm lactose-intolerant this weekend when i ate some ice cream. so i'm no longer going to take a milk when i purchase lunch. i could try and take "lactaid" with me to work, but it's a lot of fuss so i think it's just best if i avoid all milk. 
Female: 100%, Female, exploring rheumatoid arthritis & pregnancy i'm a 29 year old nearly-newlywed – and i have rheumatoid arthritis. i was diagnosed just over a year ago, only a few short months after my wedding. it's been a bumpy road over the last year, but i am finally at a point where my health is in fairly good shape and i am essentially in remission (meaning i have limited swelling, pain and fatigue). but, that remission comes at a cost. that being some serious medications.
Female: 100%, Female, to balance out the disappointing preschool stuff, i should mention that both boys are making unprecedented progress at home and aba. yesterday the aba therapists said that they'd tried g. on matching words to pictures, and he seemed to get it. he won't do picture-matching tasks-- we think he just doesn't see the point. they also started working on writing letters. when they originally tried to get him to trace letters, he got very upset, i guess because it was messing up a perfectly good letter. but writing his own letter isn't so upsetting, or so we hope! b. is singing up a storm. he is stuck on the line "the mommies on the bus go "shush, shush, shush", for whatever reason (??), and he also keeps repeating "i like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas". either one of those things would have seemed impossible a few months ago. and with some encouragement, he'll point to the sentence strips i have around the kitchen and mutter, "wan nuk (milk), peezh" or "wanna cookie". that is really, really amazing for me to hear.
Male: 100%, Female, interleague baseball was first proposed in the 1930s. it took some 60 years for the first game to be played. what took so long? the answer lies in the traditionalist heart. the first interleague game was in 1997, and was the brainchild of the owners to boost attendance and revenue. and although it gives us fans an opportunity to see players we wouldn't normally get to see, i'm going to go on record as saying i don't love interleague games. maybe i'm not a fan because i'm bitter that the american league dominates. last year, the al enjoyed a combined 149-103 edge. boo! or maybe i feel it takes away from the uniqueness of the all-star game or, more importantly, the drama of the world series. or maybe it is just a combination of all of it. i was reading mark newman's article on mlb.com today and learned that interleague attendance just keeps growing. mark states, "total interleague attendance has risen every year from 2002-08, going from 7,741,496 over 249 dates in 2002 to a little shy of one full ballpark under 9 million in 2008." also in this article, bud selig is quoted as saying, "as long as i'm here, we will have interleague play. i love it." (hmmm. my other least favorite thing in baseball -- home field advantage in the world series based on the all-star game winner -- was introduced by selig, too. hmmm. but i digress.) baseball attendance is down four percent this year, in my opinion, due to the economy. baseball officials disagree, claiming that attendance is down due to the fact that the new yankee stadium and citi field each have 15,000 fewer seats. whatever the reason, it will be interesting to see if the attendance for the scheduled interleague games this season continues, on trend, to grow, or if interleague attendance also declines. if regular season interleague baseball is here to stay, there is something that has been proposed numerous times before by players, sports journalists and fans that i really think would make interleague games more interesting. play by the visiting team's league rules. for instance, if you are playing in a national league park against an american league team, use the designated hitter rule so that fans who don't normally get to see the other league's style of ball in their stadium get to see it first-hand. just an idea. what are your thoughts on interleague play? peace, love, and baseball, alyssa 
Male: 100%, Female, ok, time to remind oneself i support the hollywood writers' strike. (grumble.) i do, i really do. (grumble.) i'm not a huge tv watcher, but i'm really starting to miss this season's hot new drama — and my newest fave — cane. the show is about the trials and tribulations of a rich and powerful cuban-american family, and i was hooked from the very first episode. new episodes of cane have been noticeably absent, along with those of most other intelligent, well-written shows, for several weeks now. in their place: reality shows, tired re-runs, third-rate movies, and other drivel. surely viewers are revolting. i'm surprised there haven't been riots in the streets. with two fizzled awards shows and pending oscar disaster, hollywood screenwriters are demonstrating the strength inherent in being able to collectively withdraw labour. this dispute is about the same issues that continue to concern canadian writers. movies and television make billions of dollars for producers and investors, and secondary digital uses such as dvds and internet downloads add to the windfall. writers want the right to share in the profits generated by material they have created — a not unreasonable position. industry executives aren't budging and negotations broke down in december. the strike's economic costs, both direct and trickle-down, are skyrocketing daily. with the oscars pending, pressure is surely mounting for all parties to kickstart the stalled bargaining process. they writers will win this thing. they have to. 
Male: 100%, Female, as his body weakened, it was as if mark grew even stronger. the last few times i visited him, i felt as if i were standing on holy ground. jesus shown that brightly through mark. it sounds cliche...but it was true. one local news story reported that mark riddering "lost his battle with lou gehrig's disease". that doesn't seem accurate. from what i know, and what i've heard from his family and friends, mark finished the race, the long tiring marathon of the last 15 years, and he finished it well. he fought the good fight. he kept the faith. he persevered to the end. the prize is now his. he didn't lose; he won. tomorrow i have the awesome yet sad privilege of attending the funeral of a true hero of the faith. mark riddering has left behind an awesome legacy. i cannot help but think that jesus greeted him with the words, "well done, my good and faithful servant." 
Female: 88%, Male, as most parents know, and as we're learning, once they start crawling and standing and exploring, the battle dominance and safety between parents and children over has only just begun. after over a month of putting it off, tricia and i decided this morning (with gwyneth's help) that our project over the weekend must be gwyneth-proofing the house. just this morning our fearless, diapered, red-kneed trouble maker rediscovered the cat food, learned how to open the kitchen cabinets and decided that a very tall study lamb had to be more fun parallel to the floor. so, we're off to home depot and walmart to stock up. got any tips, products, resources or creative battle strategies to share with us? now's your chance to help us get starting with a victory!
Female: 100%, Female, last spring, noah (ethan's pistol of a little brother) wanted to do karaoke at are local amusement park. we said that he'd have to learn a song, practice, and then he could do it. to our surprise, ethan told us that he wanted to do it too. ethan loves to sing and watch american idol, but i was surprised that he wanted to go up on stage and perform. he's done plays at school and always learns his lines/songs, but it was hard to get a read from him as to whether or not he enjoyed the process. it seemed like he did. he learned a song (david cook's light on) and they both did a great job. then last month a school notice went home about the school talent show. little noah loves an audience and said that he wanted to do the show. ethan, once again said that he'd like to be in it too. they formed a trio with their friend jake, practiced with the whole crowd of kids for 3 weeks, and performed "just one person" from snoopy the musical. it's quite moving to think about ethan enjoying performing. i always enjoyed performing and i think i'd have a hard time explaining why i liked it so. i liked the process. i liked having audience reaction. i wonder what it is? but in any case both my boys enjoy it too. i'll also admit, i'm quite emotionally moved that my little boy who wouldn't turn his head at his name, who didn't call me 'mommy' until 4 1/2 years old, and who seems to spend so much of his time in his own little world enjoys performing and did a wonderful job at the school talent show. i'm so proud of both of them.
Male: 57%, Female, how would you describe time? does it fly by too fast or stand still? do you know “where the time went?” it's hard to believe we're already a decade into the 21st century! ten years ago, we had concerns about y2k and how it would wreak havoc on the world. now we're dropping the double zero's as we head into the year, “twenty-ten.” like it or not, the clock continues to tick, ringing in a new year every 365 days. do any of you have january birthdays? i do. in addition to celebrating a new year, in the coming days, i'll be adding another year to my life. that's a good thing, i guess. it's a whole lot better than the alternative! with the passage of another year, many of us reflect on the years gone by and the milestones of our lives. we often revisit the days of our past and wonder how we made it this far. or, we relive an occasion that brought joy to our hearts, causing us to smile once again.
Female: 100%, Female, grrrrrr those numbers are frustrating!! try as i might, i don't seem to be able to consistently keep my blood glucose level where it's supposed to be. oh, there are always times when i know exactly what i splurged on that shot it up, and i can accept that as a rare occurrence. it's when i think i've eaten a really good diabetic meal and still have a high reading that is so frustrating. hubby thought maybe my testing equipment was just registering high, after we read an article stating that home testing equipment can give results as much as 20% in error. so, just to see what would happen i double tested for several days last week, using the same blood drop with two different testing kits. sometimes the second one would be lower, and sometimes it would be higher. but both kits consistently showed me too high when it went over the limit my doctor set for me. so i can't blame it on the 20% inaccuracy findings. i seem to be particularly susceptible to a glucose rise if i eat most whole wheat breads, something i thought i could have in moderation. so it's a small piece of sour dough bread with lunch and occasionally a few whole wheat melba toast pieces with dinner. and i can only manage a very small amount of fruit, which seems to work better if i eat it first. i guess it gets mixed in with the rest of the meal that way and doesn't have a chance to make a big spike of sugar. so, in effect, i eat my dessert first now. so i continue to learn what my body will tolerate and what it will not, and we both read everything we can get our hands on that might help me beat this disease as quickly and completely as possible.
Male: 100%, Female, as i've mentioned in a number of my posts, my add spouse and i separated several years ago because i just couldn't take dealing with his add issues any more. even though he had been on medication and in counseling for 10 years, there were still many problems, especially in the area of communication. as our marriage disintegrated, the communications got worse. so when we decided we wanted to try to salvage our marriage, my husband's counselor (who also knew me from some joint counseling sessions we had done) suggested that we should try a different approach to communication. instead of discussing things at any old time, and getting into communications problems constantly, he proposed that we have several formal meetings each week where we would talk about problems and conflicts, matters that might require negotiation, plans, and status -- just like in a business meeting. the rest of the time outside the meetings we would only converse on pleasant topics -- like social chit-chat, or anything else we both enjoyed, unless it was something exceptionally urgent (like, "the house is on fire"). the intent was to create a context for my husband to be able to focus his attention on the items we needed to discuss, while freeing him the rest of the time from having to try to pay attention when his mind was already engaged with something else. with some reservations on both sides, we began scheduling meetings and trying to work within this framework. i found it frustrating to "hold off" talking about matters that arose that were important to me, until our meeting -- when i see a problem, i want to tackle it now! -- and my husband initially had trouble with being prepared for the meetings, but we adjusted after a couple of months. business meetings are usually set for definite periods of time, and we quickly learned that we needed to do the same -- at first, my husband could only maintain focus for an hour at best. often that meant that topics got deferred to a later meeting, which was very frustrating for me. but as we became more practiced, he was able to increase his focus time, so this problem eventually went away. normally, people don't yell at each other in a business meeting, it's unprofessional -- at first we didn't implement this concept in our meetings, and we ended up with some meetings being just one concentrated yelling spree. since my husband can't think at all when he gets upset, our discussions were going nowhere, so we adopted this business policy as well. this was very difficult for me to implement, since i'm an impatient angry sort of person by nature, but it was well worth it since the reduction of the emotional tension made it much more possible for my husband to apply his mind to the subjects at hand. other problems arose: my husband took few notes, and so some of things we'd talk about never got "on his radar screen" for follow-up; when he took notes, they were often so vague that he'd misinterpret them later on and then we'd be at odds about what had been discussed; and worst, he'd forget the date/time and not show up, or show up late (even though we created a regular schedule!!). these were serious roadblocks, and it took some pretty hard work to deal with them. to help my husband take better notes, we'd compare notes at the end of each discussion, or at the end of the meeting, to make sure we had both captured the same information -- he would read back his notes, and i'd identify any discrepancies with mine, and then we would mutually resolve the discrepancies. in the process of making sure we were "on the same page", we'd also be able to ensure that his notes were more detailed and less vague. as far as the lateness/forgetting problem went, we agreed to implement a rule that if he failed to renegotiate a meeting date/time ahead of time, and was late or a no-show, that the meeting would be rescheduled at *my* convenience (but i had to be fair and not just schedule a bad time for him as "pay-back"). there were other policies we found useful to implement, through trial and error. since it wasn't certain there would be enough time to cover everything, we decided to cover "logistical" topics first (e.g., who has what appointments coming up this week, who is picking up the dry cleaning when, etc.), then topics where some decision was necessary, project status, and such, and finally more nebulous topics that involve some negotiation or conflict or exploration. before we instituted the meetings, my husband often felt that i was always the one driving the discussions, so to avoid that we developed a policy that we would address his agenda before mine (not necessarily his entire agenda -- but his logistics before mine, his project status before mine, etc.) when my husband would agree to take on some task in our meetings, he'd make notes about it but wouldn't necessarily set a particular target date -- and without a target date, he would have no reminder alarm in his pda or anywhere else, so it often wouldn't get done -- so now we set up a target date in the meeting as well. when i would ask for status on some item that he was supposed to be working on, he'd sometimes have a hard time remembering what he was supposed to have been doing, and it slowed down our meetings a lot to go over it -- so now he does a brief review of his notes of the previous meeting before we start each new one. we fiddled with the frequency of our meetings at times, but generally have found that three times a week works best for us. we both sometimes relapse into bad old habits, but we now have the mechanisms in place to correct those problems when they occur. once we ironed out these wrinkles (after about six months), we found that the meetings not only accomplished their intended purposes of providing a structured context for discussion and negotiation plus better interactions outside the meetings, but they some pleasant unexpected results as well. my husband has become much better at follow-through, because he knows there will be a status check in an upcoming meeting, and this has reduced my need to nag. i've learned how to address conflicts without yelling (well, most of the time). we have a much more structured dynamic for communications, which leads to fewer misunderstandings. my husband's note-taking has improved so greatly that we rarely need to do re-caps anymore, which shortens the meetings and again contributes to better follow-through. and the meetings as we have set them up provide a method for coming back to unresolved problems, with the chance to review the notes and reflect during the intervening time -- this has been an important element in reaching an accord on many of the more fundamental complex problems surrounding add behaviors. i've resisted the urge to end with a bullet-list summary of "rules" for setting up such meetings: this kind of setup should not be a straight-jacket, and i think that each couple has different problems and therefore needs for different rules which only they can discover as they work through this kind of process themselves. i think the only real rule is the original intent -- to create a context for focused attention on interpersonal matters, and to exclude those discussions from the rest of your interactions. this isn't a perfect system -- it doesn't always work smoothly every time -- but it's a very helpful framework. suffice it to say that these meetings were a key component in ending our separation -- i really don't know if we could have resolved our communications problems without them -- and we have found them so helpful, we are still holding them more than four years later! they can definitely be a powerful tool in the add-coping toolbox.
Female: 100%, Female, school lunch costs me $3.00 per day. i don't carry cash. the cash part of this "experiment" has been pretty challenging. i do carry bills, but they are usually twenties and disappear quickly. open your wallet. do you have three singles? would you be able to acquire single dollar bills for every lunch this week? it's been oddly difficult for me. the lunch ladies don't make change. i have shown up with a $5 and they give me a look like i think they are some kind of shiny atm. grudgingly they find the money, but i often have to wait for it. so since starting this project, i have had to be creative with my money. i've borrowed money from my husband (indefinite loan). i've stopped at businesses and bought random things just for the change. one day i stopped at star*bucks before work and bought a drink. i never do this by the way. i asked the barista, "can i have change in dollars?" he asked me, "you need it for the tolls?" i stammered with a smile, "yeah, basically." i'm sure he knew i was lying, but i didn't want to get stuck in a long discussion not to mention my concern about my anonymity (there might be other teachers waiting for their cappuccinos). i mean, what do people need singles for? the only thing i can think of is going to a strip club. mr. barista was left wondering what i was up to. i certainly look like an exhausted working mother -- not the kind of gal gearing up to go to chip*n*dale's. 
Female: 100%, Female, today's menu: meatloaf, bread, fruit cup, mystery greens (!), milk to qualify for the label "meatloaf" i think meat should be baked in a loaf pan and then sliced. so given that definition, it is obvious that what i ate today is not meatloaf, but instead a meat patty. and i was so thrilled to see what i assumed to be spinach!! i was floored. but then when i took a bite they were so very bitter. after work i chatted with my mom about it and she thinks they are collard greens. frankly, it looks like spinach. but i'm not sure it was. all i can say is that this was the first time i could not finish my veggies during this experiment. i had three bites of the most bitter greens i have ever tasted. can someone enlighten me as to what i ate? so basically i ate the meat and the bread for lunch. additionally, yesterday's "day-glo" cornbread muffin was normal colored in real life. there are flourescent lights in school and i also use a cell phone camera so i guess that made it look funny. the picture didn't look very distorted to me though. 
Male: 100%, Male,  i couldn't read. i had no concept of time. i had no clue what baseball was. i didn't know the world series existed before the red sox made it there in 1986. but stickers? yeah, i kinda knew what stickers were. stickers and i have enjoyed a love-love relationship my whole life. dinosaur stickers begot robot stickers eventually begot obey giant stickers. so when i reached a certain collecting-and-knowing-what-baseball-was-age, stickers and i rekindled our love affair once more in the form of the panini and topps sticker books. i never completed my sticker albums, but i was always gung-ho. i just want to get all of this off my chest before i start down this long, sometimes dusty, but always sticky road. initial thoughts 1982 topps stickers. man, that kid on the box is kind of creepy, isn't he? and yet, i'd be as stoked as he obviously is if i was eight years old and embarking on a magnificent sticker-filled adventure. if we all agree for the moment that the kid on the box was around eight years old in 1982... he would be 36 today. gary carter is on the front of the album, and each page has a slightly obscured shadow portrait of a member of each team. what's creepy about this is that the eyes have been removed from each person, leaving somewhat anonymous baseball-playing zombies haunting the backgrounds of each page. twenty cents for five stickers to a pack, which means the minimum a kid was spending to fill his or her album was (260 stickers/5= 52 unique packs) 52 x 20¢ = $10.40 (+ 25¢ for the album)... so a total of $10.65 to complete the album without ever getting a double. not exactly chump change to a kid in 1982. so i've armed myself with a complete, unopened box of stickers (100 packs), which was easier than expected to track down, and an unused sticker album. let's get this sticker party started 
Male: 100%, Male, you know, i want to be excited by this. it looks like they even got marvin from pulp fiction. you know, the guy they accidently shoot and have to call harvey keitel to mop up the blood. well, i don't see a credit for back on topps on his imdb.com page, but that really looks like him. i also like the reference to the "cocaine out of a bread truck," though if we remember back to last year, i believe it was a mr. softee truck out in jamaica, queens, where the driver was selling cocaine on the side. (his trick? double-cupping the sundaes. ingenious.) so yeah, i want to get excited. but you know what would really get me jazzed on this series--and yes, i just said 'jazzed', which hopefully came across in a completely non-sexual way, though now that i've taken the energy to explain probably does come across as sexual--? i think you know... that's right: a re-occurring character who either appears in a dream sequence or within the wacky corporate world of topps hq who also happens to be on a mini allen & ginter card (or 1975 topps mini). or is lil' kwame brown. this character would best be played by a real-life athlete, with his character name simply his real name with 'baby' or 'lil'' in front of it. like "baby rafael furcal" or "lil' dmitri". actually, that last one's not bad. get dmitri young on the phone to play the topps egghead archivist (who expounds on his love of gem mint cards and also happens to be trapped on a mini a & g card). 
Female: 100%, Female, wow, what a weekend!!! let me start off by saying that we will never fly using southwest airlines ever again! all 17 of us flew out of islip airport in long island on thursdays and arrived in chicago at midway airport. my sister in law, eileen, and her husband's 2 suitcases, missing and never arrived for the whole weekend. they had to go out and buy clothes for the wedding (which they were reimbursed for) and then yesterday, lets see.... finding out that one of eileen's bags had been found in florida, my other sister in law, kerry's boyfriend's luggage not arriving with his flight, my brother in law, christopher (the groom's) luggage not making it to their honeymoon destination and to top it off, they lost joey's carseat!!! keep in mind, on the way home, there was 3 different flights and on each flight, someone lost luggage. and i wouldn't have been so mad about our's, but come on, a car seat?! thankfully, they had loaner carseats so we were able to go home and also thankfully, joey's carseat was found by the time my in-laws flew in last night so they were able to bring his carseat home with them and southwest airlines is going to pay to have the loaner carseat fedex'ed back to them.
Male: 100%, Male, i take collation pretty seriously, mostly because i enjoy knowing what i'm going to get once i know the top card (or sticker, as the case may be). for this box, if tom seaver was first out of the pack, your four others would be in this order: jerry remy, dusty baker, mike schmidt, and vida blue. similarly, if you pulled paul molitor first, there was nearly a 100% chance that the third sticker would be manny trillo, the fourth sticker would be bob horner, and the second and fifth stickers would be random. even the seemingly random-seeded stickers weren't seeded all that randomly. for instance, andre dawson was locked in the 1 hole, john castino and fred lynn both 2's, john mayberry a 3, pete rose highlight a 4, and cecil cooper, cliff johnson, dave collins, and at least 18 others at 5. there were "rogue" stickers as well, or those that didn't appear in a consistent slot (keith hernandez, rollie fingers league leaders). and there, hidden amongst the doubles, triples, rogues and locked rows were actual single print stickers – 25 of them to be exact, including all five of the stickers from pack 1. amazing. someone asked me today what my goal of this project was. i answered that i wanted to be able to hypothetically assemble an uncut sheet of stickers without knowing exactly where each sticker would have fit. and while that would be a neat exercise to actually do, the more i thought about individual box collation, pack cycles, and pack pockets, the more i realized that to make generalizations based a very small sample is at best unwise and at worst just plain stupid. i remember a few years ago when i started a pack a day, i ripped a box of 1989-90 hoops series one. i found that not only was the david robinson draft-day rookie short print not actually short-printed, but i found that if you got it in a pack, you also got larry bird (i ended up getting about 4 of each from that one box). but while my experience tells me that the robinson wasn't actually a short print, why is it always listed as a short print? using my one-box example to make a generalization doesn't really work. there are reasons why card companies serial-number cards nowadays. for one thing, it creates a sense of a limited supply. for another thing, it completely destroys the idea of a general collation. just because you get autographed relic card a doesn't mean you'll also get commons b, c, and d (well, unless the auto relics are considered rogues, then that opens up whole new possibilities...). of course, this is not true of regular card products. i'd bet that topps 2010 has just as poor collation as topps 1986. in any event, if you can view a google doc, you can take a look at my documented collation from my box of 1982 topps stickers. 
Female: 100%, Female, one day last week i wore a pair of pants to work that i bought for $5 (online and on sale). i love to get a bargain when i shop for clothes. i know full well that i'll probably get a year out of them and that'll be it. it has taken me most of my life to realize that there are things that you buy on sale and things that you spend more on. over the past year i took stock of my shoes and realized that i had bought too many "for the right price" and too few for their quality. when i analyzed how many pairs i actually wore and why, i figured out that my favorite pairs are high quality shoes i spent a lot of money on. so i threw out all the pairs that don't fit right or my foot jiggles in or the ones that rub my ankle raw if i don't wear them with socks (inevitably i forget that fact and wear them to work without socks). i spend the whole day on my feet so quality shoes are a priority. then i bought myself a couple new pairs that cost me a lot, but i realize the high cost up front pays off: my back and feet don't hurt! my husband and i are the rare duo that both enjoy food shopping and we buy quality food. we are lucky to be able to splurge on little indulgences and bigger ones sometimes too. for our family, organic options matter. i enjoy cooking (my husband doesn't know how to cook, but he can boil water) and shopping is the natural extension of that experience. we're passing on a love of food to our kid and we make sure to buy the best that we can afford. why can't we give all children the best possible food we can find while they are at school? why do they have to get the cheapest stuff? if their health and wellness is truly a priority, then we need to pony up and find a way to feed them as if they matter. children are not "little adults." they are learning and growing every day (i'm only growing out not up). there are some things you spend extra money on and that would be this nation's kids. 
Female: 100%, Male, my hands keep working pretty well when i'm drinking. my adhd mind is more problematic. i've tried to avoid this, largely because i think that according to whatever code of scribal ethics i do, or should, observe, it's reprehensible. nonetheless — and this might well have summat to do with my having read about one of my literary heroes, w.h. auden, sitting in a dive bar on st. mark's place sucking down the vsop all day long, no doubt fending off propositions from ginsberg, writing away. i can't do it. i believe i've made that clear. if i haven't, here's the dilly-o. my hands keep working pretty well when i'm drinking. my adhd mind is more problematic. of course, my mind is problematic in the best of situations. i sure as hell can't control it. so it's snowing here in gotham. it would be an excellent night to find a nice ginmill and spend the rest of the evening consuming a pride of beers and a couple of packs of marlboros. except for (1) i don't smoke any more and (2) even if i did, you can't light up in bars here in the city. there were a couple of pints in the refrigerator when i got home from tai chi, and they went fast, so i had a couple more. all to the good. i can feel the universe narrowing, feel my interest in my own thoughts burgeoning, and feel the external noise fading away. the thirst is far from satisfied, amigos. but that's it for tonight. i know where i stand, and where i'd stand, or flop, if i had a couple more pints. nowhere good, i assure you. the issue of creating, even on the abcedarian level at which i compose, and drinking is complex. it's like juggling sushi knives. one slip and you're not witty, you're exsanguinating. remember the scene in deer hunter where walken was playing russian roulette? not quite so severe, but a loss is a loss. so i'll be signing off now, chillin' like bob dylan. when i review this tomorrow, i may have more to say.
Female: 100%, Female, like i said in a previous post, there will be some gaps in school lunch consumption in february. so instead of my usual lunch post, i'm sharing a photo i took of a vending machine that i saw at a different school. when i walked by the vending machine, i was taken aback. it was visually shocking. what you see are lots of pop*tarts on the bottom, rice*krispie*treats on the top, and some generic peanut butter cracker/cookie sandwiches. i felt obligated to take a picture of the vending machine because it startled me. i did it as discreetly as i could and i tried to keep moving so i don't know how much the items cost. i should also say that there was another vending machine nearby that held the usual assortment of chips, chocolate, and candy. many schools have given up vending machines due to the belief that they are making children obese. i think there are many kids who eat unhealthy foods right after school. if you have a vending machine snack that has upwards of 200 calories every single day after school, you will start to gain weight. i was trying to find more articles about vending machines in the schools. what i did find were some companies that are trying to develop healthy vending machines. i personally like this idea a lot. what do you think? is there such a thing as a "healthy" vending machine? here are a couple companies that i located online: 
Female: 100%, Female, today's menu: rib-a-cue, whole wheat bun, corn, apple, (milk). so the "rib-a-cue" looks bad, but when i opened the package, it smelled terrific and it actually tasted really good. today i was offered a choice (!!) of the rib-a-cue or lasagna. i didn't see the lasagna sitting out so i decided on the rib-a-cue, which was sitting in a big stack for the kids to take. i'm starting to become friends with the lunch room personnel. i was always nice to them before but we're definitely establishing a relationship! someone commented that i'm eating lunch everyday.... if they only knew the whole story! 
Female: 100%, Female, yesterday mr man was "not fine". he was very ill in fact. he was banging his head on his pillow in an effort to get the voices to stop. he didn't even hear me talking to him and seemed unaware of my presence until i put my arm around him. he told me he had to get on with his "work" again, and he had to mark himself with his number - 4064. i was worried that he was going to carve it into his arm with a knife or something. later he got out "the folder". the folder has paper in it, and that is where he writes his "codes" and things like that - "work" that the voices have given him to do. he hasn't got the folder out since 2004. i couldn't believe his symptoms had deteriorated so much in such a short space of time, but i knew what the trigger was - we were supposed to be going out that evening to commemorate the death of christ, and he was very anxious about it. needless to say, we didn't go. mr man is still unwell today, but much better than yesterday, and typically he doesn't remember much of yesterday. i say "typically" because it is quite common for mr man to be unable to remember periods when he has been acutely ill. he's been a little unwell for a while now though. just a couple of weeks ago he spoke to his occupational therapist about how he was feeling. she was concerned enough to start visiting him every couple of days, and she even gave him her mobile phone number in case of a crisis, but he didn't want to talk to me about how he was feeling. i didn't mind; i understood that he doesn't like me to worry about him, and to be honest i was just glad that he was talking to someone instead of keeping it all to himself.
Female: 100%, Female, i have not intentionally given up blogging. we are simply at a point where living our lives is taking up all of our energy. there is progress going on, and there is also a lot of poop, peanut butter, toothpaste, urine and other stuff to clean up. we are having lots of fun in general, but it's a very energetic type of fun! lots of chasing boys across soccer fields, through target, and so forth. i always wondered what would happen when they got too big for strollers and shopping carts and now i know. i like to think my cardio vascular health must be getting great. hope to return to blogging before too long. 
Male: 100%, Male, sometime in december i decided to find out how long it would take to put together a set by simply buying wax packs. of course, the holidays were fast approaching, so this became a project for after the madness passed. and now here we are. a few days ago, i put out a message on facebook/twitter asking for help: which set should i put together? the choices were 1981 fleer, 1990 topps, 1991 topps, 1992 upper deck, 1994 fleer, and a random 1980s topps sticker set. i got a lot of response, mostly choosing a sticker set (5 votes), 1981 fleer (2 votes), or 1990 topps (2 votes). after much deliberation, here's the set i'll be aiming to complete: 1982 topps stickers. i chose 1982 because of the availability of unopened sticker packs and unused sticker albums. after i complete the sticker album, i will attempt to complete 1991 topps, a set i never liked and never bought when it came out. after 1991 topps, who knows. here are the rules: no trading. no buying of opened lots on ebay. i will only buy packs. i also plan on tracking sticker/card sequencing in packs. i will then fill in each page of the sticker album as best i can. i still haven't figured out what to do with the sticker doubles, but i think some sort of public art around boston will be on tap. 
Female: 100%, Male, hi all, it's been a while since my last post as not much has changed, i am still managing on 12.5mg methotrexate weekly and 75mg diclofenac daily, my last blood tests showed that i am still anaemic with low ferritin levels (as i think ive said before i just cannot tolerate the iron (ferrous sulphate) tablets), so i am now waiting for a date to have another endoscopy to check for ulcers which i ain't looking forward to. my joints are not too bad at the moment on the lower methotrexate dose although my skin is creeping up again. i hope everyone is bearing up and ok, all the best
Male: 100%, Male, in my view, this is a step in the wrong direction. the tax on so-called cadillac health plans made sense as a way to reduce the existing tax incentive toward excessively generous health insurance, which in turn encourages excessive use of healthcare. that reform is, apparently, now gone. instead, the current administration proposal is to increase the tax on capital income, reducing the incentive for saving and investment. in other words, the new proposal would do less to bend the curve of rising healthcare costs and more to impede long-run economic growth. this change was probably made to attract more house democrats. it will likely make the plan even less attractive to congressional republicans. by the way, according to cbo director doug elmendorf, the new administration proposal has too few details for the cbo to provide cost estimates. perhaps more details will be available in the days to come. 
Female: 99%, Female, hi kristyn! i thought this was a really well done blog on sensory integration dysfunction. i will pass it on to others. i found out last year that my son is very sensory seeking. i had never heard of sensory integration concerns before my son started exhibiting signs of this dysfunction, and it was a very confusing time for me. i wish i had gone on-line and connected with others! currently, i am trying to raise awareness about spd through our book i can be: a child's whimsical introduction to yoga. i have been practicing this book with my son since he was a baby and little did i know that it was a great tool for his sensory concerns. a percentage of our proceeds goes to a local nonprofit dedicated to preventing developmental delays through education. if you get a moment, we also have a blog, our website is www.qandjbirdpress.com. i look forward to reading more of your blogs.
Female: 100%, Female, our special children, these bright and creative adhd children, can be such a challenge to parent. we watch them bounce around in our neuro-typical world, stumbling and falling more than their peers. we want to fix it and make it all better, as though adhd is just a boo-boo, but it's not and we can't. at some point, we come to accept that it can't be changed. we even come to accept adhd into our lives and our families and focus on the gifts despite adhd. we focus on our children's talents and their accomplishments and love them unconditionally. but we worry about their futures too, the time when they are no longer under our wing and must learn to soar on their own. my son often gives me glimpses of his future and lets me know he's going to be okay. not just okay, but great even. quite often these glimpses are hidden in the most brief moments of peace and joy. these times when i am observing him and i am not worried but content and joyful. when he creates something unique, says something insightful, or achieves something so easy for his peers, i can peek into his future and be satisfied. that little moment when i realize i am at peace with adhd.
Male: 100%, Male, jane went to see the psychiatrist today with a friend. she wrote out an agenda of questions for discussion but he was bemused by it. he thought he ought to have all the answers but didn't have an answer to one of them. he seemed not to understand that they were points for discussion rather than direct questions of him. he was frightened that he didn't have the answers. he was even more frightened that he didn't understand the questions. jane was yet even more frightened that he didn't understand the questions. he felt "got at" because of this ... but it was a genuine attempt to have a multi-disciplinary discussion. as the team leader, surely he should feel competent in this? their ward rounds are described as multi-disciplinary team meetings. but he didn't feel confident. he could talk about medication, leave and risk assessments; anything else sent him into a panic or denial. consultant psychiatrists in the nhs are not used to being questioned or having to substantiate what they are doing. they expect deference and in return do what the ward staff ask of them. it is four weeks since he suggested he wanted a second opinion for sam. he has done nothing since then. when jane discussed this with him he suggested a name for the second opinion. we have googled him and he is an expert in "schizophrenia", in medication and in treatment resistance. he has written papers about the additional medication that sam's psychiatrist wants to introduce. what is the point in getting a true second opinion from someone whose background is such that they are almost certain to support what sam's psychiatrist intended to do in the first place? we have been very polite with him so far. perhaps it was good to have made him squirm a little today ... though on previous occasions this has often had negative outcomes.
Male: 100%, Female, i wondered whether you may be able to offer some advice. i'm an occupational therapist working for the nhs in sheffield;uk. a group of professionals have started to plan an adhd group for adults and we are generally involved in developing a service for this client group (very little support available currently). we are struggling to find information / research / examples of groups which we can learn from. we have a number of ideas including using psychosocial and behavioural interventions and have flirted with the idea of incorporating a sensory integration approach. however we are concerned about the little evidence on sensory integration and adhd. my question to you is this: can you point me in the direction of any evidence / journal name or particular paper /examples of good practise / contact name / ….etc for adult support groups and sensory integration. if you do – i'll think yer amazing and tell all my colleagues about how wonderful you are!!! does this encourage you?!* anyway thanks for the website – it's already proved very useful and i look forward to reading the updates, liz.
Female: 100%, Female, one of those men was mark riddering. we barely knew him when he helped us move, but that didn't stop him from eagerly volunteering to help. as we got to know him...well, i have to admit that he sometimes made me feel like i did when i was a little girl and hero-worshiped a heroic policeman. mark riddering was a good cop. he was a true hero. he was also one of the sweetest, kindest men i've ever met. i loved watching him interact with his kids, loved watching how he looked at them, how he played with them, how he so obviously cherished them and his wife. he enjoyed life...enjoyed his family...enjoyed his many, many friends. i don't think i'll ever forget his smile or his laugh. we knew mark during the time when he began noticing troubling symptoms, and when he received the diagnosis of als. he was an important part of the weekly bible study that first met in his home and later in ours. we all watched him walk through this time of uncertainty. if he felt sorry for himself, we never knew it --- his concern was always for his family...and that he would be found faithful in god's eyes. over the months and years, we watched his big strong body deteriorate. never once did we hear him complain. instead, we still heard him laugh and still enjoyed his smiles, his loving concern for our family, and his sense of humor. he encouraged others over and over again. 
Female: 100%, Female, showing improvement well, i've been on the antibiotics and other meds that my gastro put me on for over a week now, and i'm beginning to see progress. i still have problems with my tummy, but the constant feeling of nausea is gone ... and good riddance! we wrapped all the presents and filled the stockings last night, so we're all ready to enjoy the next few days with our family. we'll all be together this christmas, and that always makes it extra special. some years we have to share our daughter with her in-laws, which is only fair, but i'm glad she and her hubby will be celebrating with us this year. we've had a particularly rewarding christmas this year already, helping a large number of families find replacements for lost or bedraggled lovies for santa to put under their christmas trees! we've received wonderfully excited thank you's from many of them, and each time one was received it just made this christmas that much more meaningful. it can't be said often enough that it really is more enjoyable to give than to receive!! my hope and prayer is that you have a christ filled christmas this year, too!
Male: 100%, Male, it's difficult enough for my adhd brain to remember what i'm doing, let alone what five or six other mooks are up to. i was diligently studying latin; ok, i was watching some tournament poker over the weekend when i realized that in a treating adhd blog post last week i'd discussed the hardships an adhdan faced when playing cards. my point was that given our adhd impaired memories, we were at a gross disadvantage, since being able to recall the cards which had been played was critical to all but the most casual levels of gaming. true enough, but not the whole story. first of all, it's not just the cards that a good player remembers, but the other players. poker players speak of a player having a "tell," some behavioral tic that he replicates in direct response to a given set of circumstances. for example, a player who's bluffing may sit there scratching at his ear, or drumming his fingers on the table (these are exceptionally overt mannerisms, but for our current purposes they'll serve). given a good hand, the same player may sit as serenely as a lama, or carefully arrange his chips in even stacks. this information only comes from constant observation and analysis, watching the actions of one's competitors and linking them to the situation that eventually reveals itself. like all data recording, the value of these observations increases in direct proportion to their quantity and accuracy. and then, of course, one has to remember this stuff. there's no benefit to an "aha!" moment, the realization that another player has just moved his glasses to the top of his head, or has started to suck on an ice cube, unless you can recall what he held the last time he did so. i've come to terms with this, and that's why i don't play cards any more. it's difficult enough for me to remember what i'm doing, let alone what five or six other mooks are up to. and that's not even allowing for the possibility that they've totally fabricated a tell, and are planning on trotting it out, blatantly, at a critical moment, probably when you're trying to decide whether or not to go all-in. sucker. ps: if don't think you have any tells, think again. all but the very best players exhibit them, and if you're reading this, slick, you're certainly not in that category.
Female: 100%, Male, jane decided to attend the ward round meeting earlier this week. we had been to the planning meeting only a couple of weeks earlier. but of course, yet again, things change so quickly that there is a need for a short term response and the longer term plan can be quickly forgotten. we wanted to emphasise our thanks to the staff for the fact that they were still being positive with sam and with us while things have been difficult. also we wanted to suggest that there needed to be a major input of some sort in terms of psychological and therapeutic support to try to get sam over this blip. they started though by trying very hard to reassure jane that they had no intentions of trying to move sam elsewhere. jane must have mentioned this. it is a real fear. it has happened everywhere else. they are so used to "improvement" in their behavioural sense with the possibility of patients moving on. when an initial improvement leads ultimately to further decline they are at a loss and eager to move him on before it becomes apparent or because they do not know want to do next. sam is now on a forensic ward. where does he go from here if they can't cope? but only a few weeks ago on christmas day sam and the family enjoyed a lovely day together. so it can go well for him and us. how do we get back on the upward spiral? so they were trying hard to reassure jane of this. then they started to talk of medication. they see a need for change. they do not understand him. he seems to be outside their experience. usually on clozapine patients do so well ... sam has been there for eighteen months now. this is the second time he has been on clozapine. both times he has been taken to hospital with physical health concerns. so what do they propose now? more psychological and therapeutic support? no ...
Female: 100%, Female, according to my psychiatrist sid is a dysfunction disorder under add/adhd. i found a site about it, after researching why i had such sensativity to smell, sound and touch. the sight calls it sensory processing disorder, instead of sid, now. there are different check list pages to see if you or a loved one might meet the criteria. when i did it, i was amazed. i met almost everything. its very interesting, i wondered, since i take add medication if that could actually make the sensory sensitivity worse. i also have ptsd. but after 9 years of being misdiagnosed, i am happy to be functioning pretty well with the add medication. as long as i dont let a rebound effect take over, i metabalize the stuff fast, and that even if it is xr. i can also take a clonazapam to relieve my oversensitivity at those times. for me the add medication, while still activly working in my brain, even makes the sid normal. all of the meds and diagnosis are tricky and time consuming, plus alot of trial and error and if lucky a positive!!
Female: 100%, Male, i had severe carpal tunnel syndrome and was headed straight under the knife, but truly didnt want surgewry... a friend told me about a 'platelet injection' made from your own blood.. i as sceptical & the pain doc in denton, tx told me it was purely experimental but it worked!!.. within a few weeks my pain deminished to the point i didnt notice it or didnt have it anymore. i cant say this is the answer for everyone.. but it surely worked for me :) best of luck to you friend!
Male: 100%, Male, once your application gets to the hiring committee, the hope is that they've already heard of you. but if they haven't, hopefully they've heard of at least one of your letter writers. when we get applications, i typically first sort by whether i've heard of the applicant, then by the number of letter writers they have that i've heard of, then loosely by the reputation of their university. and i make my way down the list, not always all the way to the bottom. (okay, i've only done this once, and i think i got about 90% of the way through.) in my experience, what we've looked for in applications is (a) a good research statement, including where you're going so as to distinguish yourself from your advisor, (b) a not-bad teaching statement (it's hard to get a job at a research university on a great teaching statement, but it's easy to lose an offer on a bad one... my feeling here is just to be concrete and not to pad it with bs -- if you don't have much to say, don't say much), (c) great letters, and (d) an impressive cv. you should expect that the hiring committee will read some of your papers before interviewing you. this means that if you have dozens, you should highlight somewhere (probably the research statement) what are they best ones that they should read. otherwise they'll choose essentially randomly, and (depending on your publishing style) this could hurt. as always, put your best foot forward and make it easy for the hiring committee to find out what's so great about you. anyway, that's basically it. there's lots more at interview stage, but these are my feelings for application stage. i'd be interested to hear if my characterization of the hiring process is vastly different than at other universities; plus, if there are other openings that might be relevant to nlp/ml folks, i'm sure people would be very pleased to seem them in the comments section. good luck, all your graduating folks! 
Male: 100%, Male, back in 2003, the popular rumor in boston was that the red sox, white sox, and rangers were going to put together a three-team trade that would send manny ramirez to texas, nomar garciaparra to chicago, and magglio ordonez and alex rodriguez to boston. nobody knows for sure what would've happened had that trade gone through, but for a minute or two there i could see a-rod and ordonez in sox uniforms. there have been other players whom i thought would end up on the sox one way or another (todd helton is at the top of that list), but one guy i never saw on the red sox was fred mcgriff. maybe it's because i was raised on the lou gorman-led sox ("what would we do with willie mcgee?"), but the sox already had mo vaughn at first. what would we have done with fred mcgriff? my grandfather grew up in a small town in south dakota. his sisters were the switchboard operators for the town, and his father the postman and local semi-pro baseball team manager. he likes to tell the story of how, towards the end of one season, his father lured a star pitcher away from a rival team. and then, instead of pitching him in the big games that followed, kept him on the bench. when asked why he would do that, my grandfather laughs and says that his dad had the luxury of not using the star pitcher--as long as he wasn't pitching for the other team. and when the a-rod and ordonez trades fell through, what did the yankees do? did they say "why do we need a-rod when we already have derek jeter?" this is one of those little things that we with the lou gorman mindset never figure out: having mo vaughn at first and fred mcgriff, be it at dh or lounging on the bench, perhaps could've pushed the sox closer to the pennant. instead we defensively scoff at even considering the possibility. 
Male: 100%, Female, i supported it. frankly, i never thought i'd live to see the day when people would try to redefine the institution of marriage and would then try to impose their ideas on others, even to the point of forcing all couples getting marriage licenses to have to be identified as "party a" or "party b", rather than as bride and groom. when suddenly marriage has become about something completely different than what it has always been understood to be...when it is no longer about a bride and groom, but about two "parties"...well, i finally decided enough was enough when it comes to people trying to impose their new definition of marriage on all of society and on our legal system. this social experimentation had gone too far. some time back, i wrote this: save marriage!! defend marriage!! i still think that the greatest threats to marriage come from within marriage itself. we are the ones who threaten our own marriages, through all manner of sin, whether it be just plain selfishness and irresponsibility, or lust, adultery, pornography, abuse...the list goes on. i wish more of us were willing to spend our time, money and effort vocally and effectively fighting those very real threats against marriage. but, in the meantime, i helped my son get signs put out. i spoke out where and when i could. and, sometime over the next few weeks, i hope to blog about why this issue is so crucial to me, and why it should be crucial to you as well...and why we need to speak out now. 
Male: 100%, Male, “greetings from the president of the united states.” that's what it said when my draft notice came in the mail, a couple of wars ago. but instead of thinking about how hard it would be to leave my family and friends for months, or years, i had another thought that ping-ponged around inside my head. what to do with my beloved and pampered 1965 mustang? it was just too dear to my heart to part with, and i didn't dare leave it for my parents to drive—or worse yet, my little brother. it would just have to be pickled, and put up on blocks for the duration. that was a long time ago, and i wish i had done a better job of preserving that car, so i could drive it today. yes, i miss that mustang. there are lots of men and women serving in our armed forces around the globe. and i receive plenty of mail from them asking me how they should store their cars while they are overseas. the rules of vehicular cold storage are the same no matter why the car is left behind. but storage isn't always kind to vehicles. corrosion and decay take their toll on engines, bodies and interiors. time itself can ruin tires, and even a car stored inside a garage can attract some unwanted furry house guests. here's how to protect and store your car, truck or motorcycle—the right way. store or sell? unless there's something very special about a particular car, i don't suggest placing a car in storage for more than a year. special-interest and collector cars, like that 1966 vette or antique hispano-suiza, might tug on your heartstrings (and purse strings) enough to keep them in the family, but anything that qualifies as practical daily transportation, no matter how nice it is, should be sold. you can replace it with another car when you're in need of a vehicle again. the loss in value of a car that accrues in another year from its manufacture, even if the odometer doesn't see any more miles, is too high. one option for shorter-term situations is to simply keep the car on the road. find some responsible adult who will drive the car every two or three weeks for an hour or more. this will keep the drivetrain lubricated and the battery charged. an engine that doesn't run regularly collects moisture and internal rust, especially on the portions of the cylinder walls not covered by the pistons, valves, camshafts and valve springs. ditto for the brake discs, which are made from easy-to-rust cast iron. a car that's driven far enough to get completely warm and remain that way for an hour or more will drive off the moisture, coat any lubricated surfaces with oil again, and sweep the rust off the discs before they start to pit. and keep your insurance active: in some states, dropping your car insurance, even if you're not going to be driving, will make it nearly impossible or very expensive to get insurance again when you're ready. check with your insurance agent; he may be able to reduce your coverage or transfer it to some less expensive option. at the very least, you'll want theft and vandalism coverage—just in case. 
Female: 100%, Male, it has been a while since my last post. these long breaks are becoming more frequent and i'm not quite sure why. my life is probably no more hectic than some of yours, so for me to make excuses would be completely reckless. many of you may have known that i have been in the media business for many years, and about 5 years ago i partnered with someone to open our own media sales organization. it was an exciting time for me and i'm glad that i did it. we had made significant progress over the years, but at the same time i felt it wasn't significant enough for me to continue in the partnership. i recently decided to hand the operations over to my partner and the other two companies that we had formed a relationship with. it was time for me to move on. i was hired four weeks ago by our local fox network affiliate, sinclair broadcasting group, the largest independent broadcasting company in the country. it has been a crazy few weeks, but things are really starting to fall into place. i am excited for our future and will try and keep all of you posted on our progress. the kids are in school and once again we are pleased with the curriculum. robin is doing extremely well in her classes to become a pa. i keep on telling myself that she'll only be in school for two more years thinking that it may calm me down a bit. it doesn't work. i'm sure that once we find our rhythm, things will fall into the proper place.
Female: 100%, Male, i have started going to school 3 days a week for about 3 hours now. i am now 17 years old. people say i have got better at speaking to people but i dont think so, i still get as nervous maybe even more. my brother adam now takes me out 3 times a week now for a couple of hours so im a lot busier than before. if youn want any advice or anything about autism comment if you want. once someone called me a professional about autism but im not, i will still try to help if i can.
Male: 100%, Female, well, i finally did it! i'm out of the stock sites. as some of you know, i have been experimenting with selling my artwork online through half a dozen stock photography and microstock sites for a couple of years. while they were generating income, the experience has never been ideal. uploading was time-consuming, especially with so many sites. it was frustrating to have certain sites reject an image for utterly arbitrary reasons, while others accepted the very same image. and i certainly didn't enjoy giving away 50% of my income to these companies for the privilege of hosting my art. i felt none did a good job of marketing or promoting my work. i had already had my own site, fractallicious, up and running for about a year, functioning primarily as a signpost to direct interested people to the various stock sites and other places, such as cafepress, where they could buy my fractal art. fractallicious was successful in that regard, but once potential customers landed on one of the stock sites i had sent them to, i became a tiny fish in a huge ocean of competitors. income trickled in in dribs and drabs. so i set out to be my own stock site. turns out, i sadly under-estimated the challenge involved in turning a static web site into a full-blown ecommerce application. it's been a long tough slog, with numerous technical difficulties, but we're finally there! the company we chose, volusion.com, provides a turnkey ecommerce platform, allowing you to create an online store with a powerful database back-end, shopping cart, and merchant account services. the volusion technology is robust, complex, and highly configurable. because of this very complexity, it's also far from intuitive and comes with a steep learning curve. the company scores an a+ for the superb quality of their 24/7 technical support. so, starting this week, i have eliminated the middleman! (and, no, this is not an april fool's joke.) i'm partnering with my sister on this endeavour, and we're not only selling gorgeous (if i say so myself) high-quality image downloads, but also certain images printed on a variety of merchandise, cafepress-style. my rainbow designs have been very popular with the gay and lesbian community, and we're starting with three of them printed on 1" buttons, and attractively packaged as a three-pack for gift giving. drop by fractallicious.com, and have a look. if you like what you see, please feel free to spread the word! 
Male: 100%, Male, ellen riloff and i run an nlp reading group pretty much every semester. last semester we covered "old school nlp." we independently came up with lists of what we consider some of the most important ideas (idea = paper) from pre-1990 (most are much earlier) and let students select which to present. there was a lot of overlap between ellen's list and mine (not surprisingly). if people are interested, i can provide the whole list (just post a comment and i'll dig it up). the whole list of topics is posted as a comment. the topics that were actually selected are here. i hope the students have found this exercise useful. it gets you thinking about language in a way that papers from the 2000s typically do not. it brings up a bunch of issues that we no longer think about frequently. like language. (joking.) (sort of.) one thing that's really stuck out for me is how much "old school" nlp comes across essentially as a study of representations. perhaps this is a result of the fact that ai -- as a field -- was (and, to some degree, still is) enamored with knowledge representation problems. to be more concrete, let's look at a few examples. it's already been a while since i read these last (i had meant to write this post during the spring when things were fresh in my head), so please forgive me if i goof a few things up. i'll start with one i know well: mann and thompson's rhetorical structure theory paper from 1988. this is basically "the" rst paper. i think that when a many people think of rst, they think of it as a list of ways that sentences can be organized into hierarchies. eg., this sentence provides background for that one, and together they argue in favor of yet a third. but this isn't really where rst begins. it begins by trying to understand the communicative role of text structure. that is, when i write, i am trying to communicate something. everything that i write (if i'm writing "well") is toward that end. for instance, in this post, i'm trying to communicate that old school nlp views representation as the heart of the issue. this current paragraph is supporting that claim by providing a concrete example, which i am using to try to convince you of my claim. as a more detailed example, take the "evidence" relation from rst. m+t have the following characterization of "evidence." herein, "n" is the nucleus of the relation, "s" is the satellite (think of these as sentences), "r" is the reader and "w" is the writer: 
Female: 100%, Female, by a customer my husband was diagnosed with an extremely severe case of colitis then crohn's disease. all that his doctors were doing were prescribing higher and higher doses of drugs (sulfasalazine, prednisone, etc.) which were making him sick and caused him to drop pounds daily. then we heard about elaine gottschall's book. it has literally been a life saver!!! the author provides both an explanation for the diet and a simple guide of "do eat" and "don't eat" foods in list form. my husband felt like he had his symptoms under control within two days! he was able to stop taking his medications with no complications. at last, no more stomachaches. after two years of being on this diet, my husband has shown remarkable improvement after follow up tests. however, don't expect your doctors to support this diet, they don't want to give up their hold on prescribing expensive prescription drugs! even more unbelievable, the specialists we've seen are completely ignorant of this book! incredible. this diet is completely natural and relatively easy to follow, especially considering the alternatives! buy this book for yourself or for your loved one who suffers from this disease. it can change lives. we cannot thank elaine gottschall enough.
Male: 100%, Male, the rest of this post are random thoughts that occurred to me at nips. maybe some of them will get other people's wheels turning? this was originally an email i sent to my students, but i figured i might as well post it for the world. but forgive the lack of capitalization :): persi diaconis' invited talk about reinforcing random walks... that is, you take a random walk, but every time you cross an edge, you increase the probability that you re-cross that edge (see coppersmith + diaconis, rolles + diaconis).... this relates to a post i had a while ago: nlpers.blogspot.com/2007/04/multinomial-on-graph.html ... i'm thinking that you could set up a reinforcing random walk on a graph to achieve this. the key problem is how to compute things -- basically want you want is to know for two nodes i,j in a graph and some n >= 0, whether there exists a walk from i to j that takes exactly n steps. seems like you could craft a clever data structure to answer this question, then set up a graph multinomial based on this, with reinforcement (the reinforcement basically looks like the additive counts you get from normal multinomials)... if you force n=1 and have a fully connected graph, you should recover a multinomial/dirichlet pair. also from persi's talk, persi and some guy sergei (sergey?) have a paper on variable length markov chains that might be interesting to look at, perhaps related to frank wood's sequence memoizer paper from icml last year. finally, also from persi's talk, steve mc_something from ohio has a paper on using common gamma distributions in different rows to set dependencies among markov chains... this is related to something i was thinking about a while ago where you want to set up transition matrices with stick-breaking processes, and to have a common, global, set of sticks that you draw from... looks like this steve mc_something guy has already done this (or something like it). not sure what made me think of this, but related to a talk we had here a few weeks ago about unit tests in scheme, where they basically randomly sample programs to "hope" to find bugs... what about setting this up as an rl problem where your reward is high if you're able to find a bug with a "simple" program... something like 0 if you don't find a bug, or 1/|p| if you find a bug with program p. (i think this came up when i was talking to percy -- liang, the other one -- about some semantics stuff he's been looking at.) afaik, no one in pl land has tried anything remotely like this... it's a little tricky because of the infinite but discrete state space (of programs), but something like an nn-backed q-learning might do something reasonable :p. i also saw a very cool "survey of vision" talk by bill freeman... one of the big problems they talked about was that no one has a good p(image) prior model. the example given was that you usually have de-noising models like p(image)*p(noisy image|image) and you can weight p(image) by ^alpha... as alpha goes to zero, you should just get a copy of your noisy image... as alpha goes to infinity, you should end up getting a good image, maybe not the one you *want*, but an image nonetheless. this doesn't happen. one way you can see that this doesn't happen is in the following task. take two images and overlay them. now try to separate the two. you *clearly* need a good prior p(image) to do this, since you've lost half your information. i was thinking about what this would look like in language land. one option would be to take two sentences and randomly interleave their words, and try to separate them out. i actually think that we could solve this tasks pretty well. you could probably formulate it as a fst problem, backed by a big n-gram language model. alternatively, you could take two documents and randomly interleave their sentences, and try to separate them out. i think we would fail miserably on this task, since it requires actually knowing what discourse structure looks like. a sentence n-gram model wouldn't work, i don't think. (although maybe it would? who knows.) anyway, i thought it was an interesting thought experiment. i'm trying to think if this is actually a real world problem... it reminds me a bit of a paper a year or so ago where they try to do something similar on irc logs, where you try to track who is speaking when... you could also do something similar on movie transcripts. hierarchical topic models with latent hierarchies drawn from the coalescent, kind of like hdp, but not quite. (yeah yeah i know i'm like a parrot with the coalescent, but it's pretty freaking awesome :p.) that's it! hope you all had a great holiday season, and enjoy your new years (i know i'm going skiing. a lot. so there, fernando! :)). 
Female: 93%, Female, most people have heard about the holiday blues, but not many have heard of the holiday flares. for those of us with rheumatoid arthritis this time of year can be the beginning of very painful season. there are many contributing factors to why you may experience a flare during the holidays; bad eating, stress and depression, just to name a few. your ra symptoms may increase due to these factors and can make what should be a great holiday into a flare to remember. the fact is we can not always control our symptoms, but we can make choices to help avoid the pitfalls of pain. the most important tip that i can give you is to slow down. there are a million things to do and not enough time to do them. so, keep it simple. your house doesn't have to look like a christmas museum in order to feel festive!
Female: 100%, Female, yesterday was the last day of winter break. our two boys had some gift certificates to spend at a local book store. when my husband and i saw i don't want to go to school written and illustrated by stephanie blake, we had to get it. i didn't read the book first and now regret buying it because it's really too young for us. the hero, simon, seems to be a kindergartner who is afraid to go to school. the guy we were thinking of is eleven and in the fourth grade. also, unlike the hero, my guy has autism and his problems with school go way beyond anxiety. (he just doesn't like it, and we're still trying to figure out why.) anyway, by the end of the story, simon decides he likes school so much he doesn't want to leave. that is great, but it makes me wish that was the case with my child. he always wants to come home!!! don't get me wrong. the book is cute. my six year old liked it a lot when i read it to him, though it seemed a bit young even for him, let alone my eleven year old. i also noticed something a bit off about the book. it's a picky point, but blake depicts simon writing his name in cursive on one of the pages. this is something a second or third grader might do, but certainly not a kindergartner on his first day at school! further, there are signs all over the kindergarten room on one page in the book. all the signs written in cursive. i've been in many a kindergarten room and usually all the signs are printed. so, that is another thing my son does not have in common with simon. he might not ever write in cursive. it's hard enough for him to print his name. c1's team at school and i think his problems with school might have to do with writing. my team and i learned about how to solve writing related problems at start. hopefully, i'll blog about the topic of hand writing soon. as far as this book goes, it seems most appropriate for young children who are just about to enter primary school (though i like wemberly worried, a similar book, by kevin henkes a bit better). blake's pictures are bright and cheerful and the story depicts simon having a lot of fun at school, but as a mom of older children i wish i had passed on this one for something more age appropriate.
Female: 100%, Female, that's what he would call himself. when i met him online, he was pastoring a tiny little church in some little texas town. but he was one of the smartest men i know, with a mind that would never forget anything. the first few things i found out about him is that he loved jesus, loved his family, loved teaching, had a special place in his heart for mothers and babies, and was hilarously funny. eventually i found out he had put together a lengthy series of lessons from the bible dealing with a certain topic in a way that infuriated me, scared me...and then set me free from a lifestyle and church that was sucking my soul -- and the souls of my family -- dry. it sounds trite and corny, but this man changed my life. sometimes i'd tease him that he ruined my life. i'd say, "here i was, happily living a life of crushing rules and regulations that i kept failing at, until you came along and ruined my life with all your talk of grace, freedom, and joy." i only met him once in person, but it was one of those unforgettable visits that our family still talks about, over a decade later. he and his wife became "uncle mike and aunt marilyn" to our family. we fell in love with their adorable baby boy. we spent a lot of time talking and laughing. they felt like long lost family. just a little bit ago i got the news: "mike has been promoted to heaven." i can't help but think that jesus greeted him with the words, "well done, my good and faithful servant. enter now into the joy of your rest." 
Male: 100%, Male, is it the scripty names? the low budget headshots? the blue outlines for american leaguers and red for national? what is it about this set that makes this grown man swoon? i'll tell you what. it's cheap. super cheap, in fact. i may be blowing my cover here, but arm yourself with the right reference guides and you can buy the rare ones for practically nothin' from the rubes on ebay. it's a good-looking set, too. clean lines, small post logo, real team insignia and uniforms––none of that crap from the eighties and nineties, after major league baseball added a (tm) to everything and made it so the third-parties didn't want to pay the licensing fees. and this one's an old set, and a short one, too. just 200 cards. and did i mention it's cheap? if you're looking for a fun, ground-floor set to get in on, make it a post cereal set from the 1960s. i chose 1962. it's got unexpected rarities (like jerry lynch), big names that are relatively easy to find, two versions of the mantle and maris cards, a host of errors, and the wonderful phenomenon of the hand-cut card. ah yes, the joys of cutting your own cards! i remember a certain will clark card i cut off the back of a drake's cakes when i was 9 years old. it had more angles and jagged edges than a rectangle is supposed to have... unless you had steady surgeon's hands or had a parent do the work, you got a ragged piece of cardboard. but that's the fun of it. besides, who wanted to wait for a parent? i needed that will clark card in my grubby stack of cards now! and no matter where you find these early-sixties post cards, be it in the dime bin at a show or a ten-dollar lot on ebay, they are always a bit ragged. sure, being born of cereal-box-grade cardboard didn't help (feels a bit flimsier than standard topps baseball cards of the day), but it's the knowledge that kids in the sixties were every bit as impatient to get at their cards as i was, twenty-five years later, that puts this set on a higher plane. so goodnight, you backs of cereal boxes, you hand-cut kings of nostalgia. 
Male: 100%, Male, this is what i mean by small changes (to the input) begetting good example. a slightly transformed zero is still a zero. of course, you have to be careful. if you rotate a six by 180 degrees, you get a nine. if you rotate a cat by 180 degrees, you get an unhappy cat. more seriously, if you're brave, you might start looking at a class of transformations called diffeomorphisms, which are fairly popular around here. these are nice because of their nice mathematical properties, but un-nice because they can be slightly too flexible for certain problems. now, let's go over to nlp land. do we ever futz with our inputs? sure! in language modeling, we'll sometimes permute words or replace one word with another to get a negative example. noah smith futzed with his inputs in contrastive estimation to produce negative examples by swapping adjacent words, or deleting words. in fact, try as i might, i cannot think of a single case in nlp where we make small changes to an input to get another good input: we always do it to get a bad input! in a sense, this means that one thing that vision people have that we don't have is a notion of semantics preserving transformations. sure, linguists (especially those from that c-guy) study transformations. and there's a vague sense that work in paraphrasing leads to transformations that maintain semantic equivalence. but the thing is that we really don't know any transformations that preserve semantics. moreover, some transformations that seem benign (eg., passivization) actually are not: one of my favorite papers at naacl this year by greene and resnik showed that syntactic structure affects sentiment (well, them, drawing on a lot of psycholinguistics work)! i don't have a significant point to this story other than it's kind of weird. i mentioned this to some people at icml and got a reaction that replacing words with synonyms should be fine. i remember doing this in high school, when word processors first started coming with thesauri packed in. the result seemed to be that if i actually knew the word i was plugging in, life was fine... but if not, it was usually a bad replacement. so this seems like something of a mixed bag: depending on how liberal you are with defining "synonym" you might be okay do this, but you might also not be. 
Female: 99%, Female, i have been losing chunks of memories. i have been experiencing it much too much lately and so i went to see a psychiatrist who told me that achalasia or my anemia could be part of it. he told me to see my primary care physician and ask him to recommend a neurologist. i am going to do it. i have an appointment to go see my doc this afternoon. in the meantime i did some research and here is what i found. read the entire article. warning: you may need a medical dictionary to decipher some of the article. the following quote is just a very small bit. but it is important to read the whole thing and maybe one of you readers can tell me what you got out of it. maybe i misunderstood it."the corollary to this is that loss of argyrophilcells may have the same clinical effect as totalneuronal fall-out."
Female: 98%, Male, arrived home from work this evening to a letter from the hospital. i've just had my monthly blood test and i immediately thought it might be a recall for another test because my numbers were high. or low. but no. the letter reads: 'an appointment has been made for you to see rheumatology nurse all grades or a member of the team'. and that's it. no explanation. no reason given. i'm not even asked if i'd like an appointment, or whether one can be arranged that's mutually convenient to me and 'nurse all grades' or the nag as i'll now think of them / it. am i alone in thinking this is a bit rude? i don't get summoned without explanation by my dentist, or my optician, or my vet (well, not my vet, the cats' vet, but you see what i mean). i feel like giving them a piece of my mind but i fear i've few enough pieces left for myself. i'll give them a call. i'm sure there's a good reason.
Female: 99%, Male, okay, so this list is all food. but frankly, what else are you going to do here? go to malls? :). there's definitely nice architecture to be seen; i would recommend the mosque off of arab street; of course you have to go to the esplanade (the durian-looking building); etc. you can see a few photos from my last trip here. now, i realize that most of the above list is not particularly friendly to my happy cow friends. here's a list of restaurants that happy cow provides. there are quite a few vegetarian options, probably partially because of the large muslim population here. there aren't as many vegan places, but certainly enough. for the vegan minded, there is a good blog about being vegan in singapore (first post is about a recent local talk by campbell, the author of the china study, which i recommend everyone at least reads). i can't vouch for the quality of these places, but here's a short list drawn from living vegan: mushroom hotpot at ling zhi fried fake meat udon noodles (though frankly i'm not a big fan of fake meat) green pasture cafe; looks like you probably have to be a bit careful here in terms of what you order yes natural; seems like it has a bunch of good options lotus veg restaurant, seems to have a bunch of dim sum (see here, too) if you must, there's pizza and oh-my-gosh, there's actually veggie chicken rice, though it doesn't seem like it holds up to the same standards as real chicken rice (if it did, that would be impressive) okay, you can find more for yourself if you go through their links :). enjoy your time here! quick update: totally forgot about coffee. if you need your espresso kick, highlander coffee (49 kampong bahru road) comes the most recommended, but is a bit of a hike from the conference area. of course, you could also try the local specialty: burnt crap with condensed milk (lots and lots of discussion especially on page two here). 
Female: 95%, Male, i'm not sure how to help you catch up with events since my last post. it's not that there have been lots of "events" - just phone calls, visits, conversations, elation and despair. just the usual really. it is just the up and down ... and the down and up. jane's spoken on the phone with the psychiatrist who was covering last week - who seemed very good and took on board our feelings that it was important to get sam out. jane also bumped into the ward manager when delivering sam his fix of tobacco and reinforced this message yet again. so they gave him leave - just around the grounds (ie the car park) with two members of staff escorting him. but at least it happened. and he's played football two days running in "the hard area" (or "cage" as we describe it.) we visited on saturday and were able to walk around the grounds with sam - and of course two staff. but he was fine. the more it works well the more they will see it is okay again and we can get back onto the upward spiral. but tomorrow we have a cpa meeting - a regular planning meeting. after making a fuss about asking for a copy of his last plan, the minutes of the last meeting and reports for the next meeting we finally got a copy of the last plan. they had some trouble tracking it down. it clearly wasn't a working document then was it ... ?
Female: 100%, Female, at my school the kids get 20 minutes for lunch, which is bell-to-bell time. so lunch time includes waiting in line, getting your items, finding a seat, opening your food packages, eating, throwing out your trash, and lining up to go back to class. if they don't finish it all, they have to throw it away. taking food back to the classroom is not allowed. i think kids get about 12-13 minutes to eat maximum if everything goes as planned. if their class is the last to get into line, well, they might have as little as 5 minutes sitting at the table. well, it just doesn't seem like enough time to eat. it's hard enough for the teachers to grab a bite in 20 minutes. after taking the kids to the cafeteria, getting my meal together (using the microwave), chatting with a teacher, and using the bathroom, i might have about five minutes to eat. also the food prepared in the school cafeteria is very often meant to be eaten by hand. so that's pretty easy to do in 5-10 minutes. it can't be utensil-friendly fare if you only get a spork. i personally can wolf down food when necessary, but i am an adult. imagine a little person who maybe eats a little more slowly than an adult. do they actually eat very much in 5 minutes? i guess my wish is that all kids get 30 minutes to eat. lunch is about learning too; it's not just filling an empty stomach (and sometimes they don't even have a chance to do that). lunch is a break for students to chat with their friends in an informal setting. learn about foods and enjoy eating. 
Male: 100%, Male, forget the cards for a second. that's right, i want to trade this harry caray bobblehead to you. but here's what you have to do: you have to offer me a better trade than anyone else. my keeper list is available to view (see link in sidebar at right), but don't let that hold you back. you want to trade me $80 in first class postage? how about a signed and numbered dan mccarthy print? or a few rare souvenir postcard folders? here's what i know about this bobblehead: 1) it was made in 2002 by bosley bobbers 2) it's still in its original box 3) the box says it's a limited edition 4) it currently retails for $79.95 on ebay (link) 5) i don't know where i got it here's what you should do if you want to add this bobblehead to your collection: email me with your trade idea. the best idea will get harry and his enormous glasses, bobbling for all eternity. 
Female: 100%, Female, when you and your spouse are first exploring whether or not adhd has been a factor in your marriage it can seem both a relief (finally, a reason that explains so much!) and a bit overwhelming (adhd seems to be everywhere!) some with adhd resist thinking about how much adhd can impact their relationship because it makes them feel "broken" or lessened. i asked myself the other day - does it matter if you label it adhd? the answer to that question is yes and no. knowing about adhd really helps you find the optimal way to improve your life. but you don't have to "label" it adhd in your everyday life. here's an example: for years my husband and i laughed because he is a man who needs to exercise pretty much every day else he can be cranky, unhappy, disconnected and hard to live with (and also doesn't sleep as well). we now realize that this is related to his adhd and that exercise is one of his forms of "treatment". but does it matter that we now know that it's adhd related? not really, as long as he's exercising. it's just him and one of the things that is part of him (with an excellent side benefit for me, in that he's in great shape!) what does matter is that you (adhd or not) get a chance to put your life in order in a way that satisfies you and brings you joy. (note i say you here. no one is obliged to satisfy anyone else.) for those with adhd who are travelling a journey to find out what brings them joy, the label of adhd is useful insomuch as when you know you have adhd, then you also know that using specific tactics that are shown to work for people with adhd is the fastest/best way to get to your goal - and sometimes the only way, given how adhd works. i always remind people - don't try harder, try differently - and by that i mean try those things that are known to work for adhd because they will work better for you than other approaces simply because of the way you are wired. while it once completely controlled my life and my husband's life, adhd is now almost non-existent in both of our lives and certainly in our marriage. you can't imagine how much better things can/will get for you if you are able to think clearly and non-judgmentally about adhd and what is already known about dealing with it. (and, for those with a learned fear of failure, having faith that good treatment means you don't have to continue to wonder whether you'll fail at what you try is also helpful...but that's a different post!) adhd is only a curse if you fight the idea of having it more than you fight to subdue it's symptoms. once you subdue the symptoms then you can start to understand the great things that it offers you, as well. for some, those things include minds that move quickly and "see" things in unique ways; tenacity (my husband is a good case of this); an ability to love well and forgive quickly (because they live in the moment); almost unending curiosity...the list is very long indeed. there's a reason why the only guy for me has adhd! everybody else is just too boring!
Female: 100%, Female, today's menu: pepperoni pizza, milk, baby carrots, multi-grain apple mini-crisps, fruit cup. our first repeat meal! i strongly dislike the pizza so for me this one was a rough. i got excited by the "mini-crisps" because i thought they might be dehydrated apple slices, but unfortunately they were rice cake-like disks. i liked the baby carrots, but i asked one of my students if he ate them and he told me, "no." the fruit cup was partially frozen. i did attempt to eat it. note: the second picture is a decent shot of the mini rice cakes. also you can see the pizza in the background. it's got a glassy film on top, which is called cheese. the cheese has separated into two layers, the "saran*wrap" layer and then the under layer. yum. 
Male: 100%, Male, if np bayes had its way on this problem (or at least if the standard models i'm familiar with had their way), they would memorize "talk" -> "talked" and "look" -> "looked" and so on because they're so familiar. sure, it would still memorize the exceptions, but it would also memorize the really common "rule cases too... why? because of course it could fall back to the parametric model, but these are so common that the standard models would really like to take advantage of the rich-get-richer phenomenon on things like dps, thus saving themselves cost by memorizing a new "cluster" for each common word. (okay, this is just my gut feeling about what such models would do, but i think it's at least defensible.) yes, you could turn the dp "alpha" parameter down, but i guess i'm just not convinced this would do the right thing. maybe i should just implement such a beast but, well, this is a blog post, not a *acl paper :p. take as an alternative example the language modeling stuff. basically what it says is "if you have enough data to substantiate memorizing a 5 gram, you should probably memorize a 5 gram." but why? if you could get the same effect with a 2 or 3 gram, why waste the storage/time?! i guess you could argue "your prior is wrong," which is probably true for most of these models. in which case i guess the question is "what prior does what i want?" i don't have a problem with rich get richer -- in fact, i think it's good in this case. i also don't have a problem with a logarithmic growth rate in the number of exceptions (though i'd be curious how this holds up empirically -- in general, i'm a big fan of checking if your prior makes sense; for instance, figure 3 (p16) of my supervised clustering paper). i just don't like the notion of memorizing when you don't have to. 
Female: 100%, Female, disneyland for little d is a mixed bag. he loves the rides but some of it can be a bit overwhelming. from the 6 hour drive to his problems adapting to his new bed, it is a mixed bag for my little one. overall he had loads of fun though, and we came through another good experience together as a family. if you do decide to try doing this. here are some tips i think you will find useful (i guess these probably work for any multi-day amusement park outing): * before you go, think about how your kid is going to sleep. something that has worked for us is to bring his bedroom fan and the bedding from his bed (his own pillowcase, etc). * bring his diagnosis with you and stop by guest services to get a special needs pass, particularly if your little one has trouble with large crowds of people or standing in lines for a long time. this is a must and boon for the whole family - it makes the park a completely different experience for everyone, and it can help family interactions since it instantly makes him very popular amongst siblings (since he has the pass and can skip lines with his party). * think about the sensory conditions of the place vis-a-vis your kid. if sensitivity to sound is a problem, lights, proprioceptive input etcetera, and try to match his/her temperament with the conditions of the ride. if your kid has never gone into any rides before, you may want to take him on something that is outdoors and low-key first (this type of ride can also help to relax him afterwards). for example, a favorite “relaxing” ride of my son is heimlich's chew chew train on california adventure, which is the bugs life character made into a train and goes outdoors inside a giant collection of food - the odors of the different foods (watermelon, animal crackers) permeate the air as the train goes. * keep close guard on him if he's a runner. a crowded mega-park is not the place you want to lose track of your kid, particularly if he's nonverbal. consider using tags or something else with your cell phone on it. if you don't have anything, even black marker on his or her belly (“if lost call (999) 999-9999”) is better than nothing. * consider your kids' limited diet. you can bring food into disneyland. * find quiet areas of the park as you walk and pick those places to take a break. take out the food at those times. also keep track of the nearest bathroom. * something i noticed and i wished i had done was have lunch in the tiki room. little d loved the room, it relaxes him to watch the birds and hear the music and once even fell asleep inside. you are allowed to eat in there as long as you pick up after yourself, which is great to keep fidgetiness to a minimum. because there really is no bad seat you can stay outside away from the crowd until the appropriate time comes (you may want to let the attendant know how many are in your party and that you will be doing this) and then just show up. or if your kid will allow it, enjoy the mini-show in the courtyard. * take some video, but not too much that you don't interact with your kid. your kid smiling and his eye contact will be priceless to remember.
Female: 100%, Female, well i'm having very little computer time because unfortunately my laptop is acting up and my hubby is still trying to diagnose the problem so we can get it fixed. i have to steal moments on his pc when i can so i may be sparse, we'll see. now on to the point, adrian's teacher called me today. she wants me to come meet her at the school tomorrow to talk about how we can help adrian communicate better at home. i'm assuming she's talking pecs, which we know all about, but i'm hoping and looking forward to any new ideas she has. i never turn down a chance to meet up with the teacher so i wasn't about to say that i didn't need advice! my conversation with adrian today: me: did you have fun at school today? adrian: (silence) me: did you have fun at school today? did you play outside? adrian: outside! me: did you go down a slide today? adrian: slide! swings! me: oh you went on the swings today? adrian: slide! swings! recess! me: oh you had recess today? was that fun? adrian: (silence) well it was some what of a conversation, i'm pleased!
Female: 100%, Female, i went to the doctor today. i have gained one pound in two months. but keep in mind that i'm no angel outside of work. for example, we just had valentine's day and i ate a lot some chocolates. i also want to let you know that in december i did have blood taken, i did a sugar fast, and the basic stats were run. at that time i was normal. i did have low hdl (the good cholesterol), but my overall cholesterol is fantastic. why did i do that? well, i have awesome insurance that gives healthy adults a yearly discount if i get a physical and basic blood work done (thereby proving my health status). i love the policy because it's common sense. plus it's a great way to discover a problem before it turns into something. preventative versus reactive. it's way cheaper to give discounts up front than pay for a major problem five years down the road. when those tests were run, i hadn't even fully come up with the idea of the blog so it's really fortuitous. whenever this project ends, i'll be able to compare pre- and post-data. that being said i haven't been feeling myself recently. i'm having more stomachaches and that's why i visited the doctor. i'm looking into it and i'll keep you updated. 
Male: 100%, Male, i had a great idea a few years back: get baseball players and other celebrities to autograph my high school yearbook. how cool would it be to open your yearbook and have, amongst notes from your old friends, fred mcgriff's autograph? or a 'best wishes' from jonathan franzen? i'm all about autographs in unexpected places. if i weren't so shy in real life i'd do it. or at least have an autograph book, filled with neighbors and other people i've met. mcgriff hit 34 home runs in the strike-shortened 1994 season. he was on pace for 48, had the season gone the full 162 games. 
Female: 100%, Female, i am a family of people suffering from arthrits. my dad and uncle tibs' bodies were so disformed it was pitiful. my hands are swollen mostly in cold weather. i am in pain most of my day. i have been told i would sooner or later have to have hip replacement. hip replacement, this is so scary. i my town all we have are quacks that can't be trusted for anything but taking our money. this i know because i have friends who have gone to these doctors. doctors here think getting old means 'you just have to put up with it. i have no way to get to a surgeon that i can trust and you say 'stress' causes more problems with my arthritis. what am i supposed to do. thanks for the shoulder.
Female: 100%, Female, doing great! i'm really feeling good these days. my stomach is behaving itself, and i'm encouraged by the strength that is returning to my legs. i was able to manage a couple of fairly steep driveways on our yard sale haunts on our date day without using the cane. that's quite a victory for me, as i can't remember how many years it's been since that was true. i'm gradually adding back in all the supplements i was taking before my stomach got ulcerated again, and so far there's been no stomach problems. that's a true blessing. i'm also encouraged by my ability to learn about the new programming language that our new sites are written in. it's slow going, but i am gradually understanding how the code is working. i'm very proud of that. i'm still going to sleep most nights at 9:00pm and getting up around 5:00am, so i'm getting plenty of sleep. i usually only wake up once in the night to make a bathroom trip, so my bladder is behaving, too. i'm getting closer to my goal of losing 50 pounds by april 1. i may not hit the date exactly, but i'm not going to miss it by much. with the lowered rate, and the care hubby takes with his grocery shopping, my blood glucose numbers have been mostly excellent for some time now. of course, there's the occasional high number, but i usually know what i've eaten to cause it, and learn accordingly. all in all, i'd say i'm in the best physical and mental state i've been in for years, and i hope it continues.
Male: 96%, Male, i've been lucky all my life to have doctors who pretty much let me do what i want. while i've had pharmacists question my inhaler use in the past, i have never had a doctor tell me to quit using it so much. now i'm not saying my doctors aren't concerned, just that i've been fortunate to have doctors that understand that not all asthmatics fit into the "guidelines." sure most asthmatics shouldn't need to use their rescue inhaler more often than once or twice in a two week period, but some asthmatics -- like me and perhaps you -- need it more often. i wrote about how i was a bronchodilatoraholic (well, i suppose, once you're a bronchodilatoraholic you always are) once or twice on my other blogs, and i have had people email me to tell me my asthma is out of control if i use it as much as i claim. when, in fact, my asthma is controlled. thus, rescue inhaler frequency isn't always an indicator of asthma control.
Male: 100%, Male, purge update. there's no turning back. those of you who want to trade with me or want some of my cards, email me and we'll figure something out. also, two nights ago i started listing cards on ebay. you can follow my auctions here. last night i posted three lots of 1959 topps venezuelan, nine cards total. almost immediately, they all sold at the "buy it now" price. if you're interested in venezuelan cards, i have about 20 from 1960 and 16 from 1966, in various conditions, with hall of famers, stars of the day, rookies, yankees, dodgers, and commons. also this weekend, i'll be posting a whole bunch of lots from the 1970s, as well as going through and putting together a 1986 topps set, then giving away all the doubles. if you're in the brookline/boston area and have a hankering for 1986 topps baseball cards, drop me a line before i drop them on craigslist. the keeper list update. as part of the epiphany, i'm putting together a list of keepers. what makes a card a keeper? it's a card i have a favorable gut reaction to, if that makes any sense. for me the holy quintet of baseball cards is 1953 topps ed mathews, 1954 topps o'brien brothers, 1958 topps stan musial all-star, 1959 topps roy campanella "symbol of courage" and 1972 topps roberto clemente. these are cards i'd consider framing, cards that transcend their subjects, cards that i consider artwork. of course there are others: 1978 topps eddie murray, 1986 donruss jose canseco, 1987 topps bo jackson to name a few. this is a work in progress, but you can follow that progress by viewing the keeper list here. if you'd like to trade with me, these are the cards i'm interested in obtaining. this weekend i'm going to start posting more about the purge in earnest. but i'm serious, if you want to trade with me or you just plain want some of my cards, email me. 
Male: 100%, Female, thalassemia is another disease that has the heterozygote advantage. this disease is very similar to sickle-cell and it also prevents malaria in heterozygotes. this disease is caused by a mutation and it causes the body to have fewer red blood cells than normal and less hemoglobin. this disease can be deadly at an early age, but in the case of a heterozygote, it can be left untreated, have blood transfusions needed, or just eating healthy. sickle-cell is found in people of african ancestry, while thalassemia is mostly in people with italian, greek, middle eastern, southern asian and african ancestry.
Male: 100%, Male, arxiv is something of an underutilized resource in computer science. indeed, many computer scientists seems not to even know it exists, despite it having been around for two decades now! on the other hand, it is immensely popular among (some branches of) mathematics and physics. this used to strike me as odd: arxiv is a computer service, why haven't computer scientists jumped on it. indeed, i spent a solid day a few months ago putting all my (well almost all my) papers on arxiv. one can always point to "culture" for such things, but i suspect there are more rational reasons why it hasn't affected us as much as it has others. i ran in to arxiv first when i was in math land. the following is a cartoon view of how (some branches of) math research gets published: authors write a paper authors submit paper to a journal authors simultaneously post paper on arxiv journal publishes (or doesn't publish) paper we can contrast this with how life goes in cs land: conference announces deadline one day before deadline, authors write a paper conference publishes (or rejects) paper i think there are a few key differences that matter. going up to the mathematician model, we can ask ourselves, why do they do #3? it's a way to get the results out without having to wait for a journal to come back with a go/no-go response. basically in the mathematician model, arxiv is used for advertising while a journal is used for a stamp of approval (or correctness). so then why don't we do arxiv too? i think there are two reasons. first, we think that conference turn around is good enough -- we don't need anything faster. second, it completely screws up our notions of blind review. if everyone simultaneously posted a paper on arxiv when submitting to a conference, we could no longer claim, at all, to be blind. (please, i beg of you, do not start commenting about blind review versus non-blind review -- i hate this topic of conversation and it never goes anywhere!) basically, we rely on our conferences to do both advertising and stamp of approval. of course, the speed of conferences is mitigated by the fact that you sometimes have to go through two or three before your paper gets in, which can make it as slow, or slower than, journals. in a sense, i think that largely because of the blind thing, and partially because conferences tend to be faster than journals, the classic usage of arxiv is not really going to happen in cs. (there's one other potential use for arxiv, which i'll refer to as the tech-report effect. i've many times seen short papers posted on people's web pages either as tech-reports or as unpublished documents. i don't mean tutorial like things, like i have, but rather real semi-research papers. these are papers that contain a nugget of an idea, but for which the authors seem unwilling to go all the way to "make it work." one could imagine posting such things on arxiv. unfortunately, i really dislike such papers. it's very much a "flag planting" move in my opinion, and it makes life difficult for people who follow. that is, if i have an idea that's in someone elses semi-research paper, do i need to cite them? ideas are a dime a dozen: making it work is often the hard part. i don't think you should get to flag plant without going through the effort of making it work. but that's just me.) however, there is one prospect that arxiv could serve that i think would be quite valuable: literally, as an archive. right now, acl has the acl anthology. uai has its own repository. icml has a rather sad state of affairs where, from what i can tell, papers from icml #### are just on the icml #### web page and if that happens to go down, oh well. all of these things could equally well be hosted on arxiv, which has strong government support to be sustained, is open access, blah blah blah. this brings me to a question for you all: how would you feel if all (or nearly all) icml papers were to be published on arxiv? that is, if your paper is accepted, instead of uploading a camera-ready pdf to the icml conference manager website, you instead uploaded to arxiv and then sent your arxiv doi link to the icml folks? 
Male: 100%, Female, i am always pushing for the reduction of the stigma surrounding mental illness. it may be my error to think that we have made progress. what i infer from this article is that universities have regressed when it comes to social acceptance of mental illness. this is something that began prior to the horrifying virgina tech massacre. read the article to learn the extremes that are being taken against those that are mentally ill. with statistics like one in four americans diagnosed with a mental illness, the number requires more mental health support. there are too many people that are not seeking the help they need. the response to the health problem the universities are making for anyone, let alone a huge number of the population, are insufficient. there is a quote in this article from a politician, rep. garnet coleman, d-houston who is open about his mental illness. i can only hope those voices in important places like his, and those of the entertainment industry like patty duke and carrie fisher, will continue to speak and unveil the misconceptions. i can only hope.
Female: 100%, Female, g's latest occupation: holding a number placemat and singing first "this old man" (one to ten) and then "there were ten in the bed and the little one said, roll over" (ten back down to one). he has found the ultimate, never-ending song! our college student who comes in the afternoons is out of town, and my sanity is already a fragile thing. i am plotting to go to every store which has the carts which will hold two or three kids (target, heb, randalls, there must be more). i've been working hard on getting them to walk with me in public, but i still need a "strapping in" option when i've got all three of them. it feels so strange to me that i can't take my kids out by myself. when they were younger and slower-moving, i could, but these days it's just not safe. everyone tells me this will get easier, and i just have to assume they are right!
Female: 100%, Female, it's a while since my last post and that's partly because i didn't have a great deal to say and partly because i was busy trying to get my life in order. i now feel as though i'm making some progress. i mentioned previously that i had been medically retired from my job and, at the age of 53, that wasn't really in my plans. aside from anything else, i've always been a very busy person and i felt as though my days didn't have much of a purpose. i had lunch with my former work colleagues last week and that was my 'leaving do'. it was lovely to see them and they gave me gifts and cards with lots of lovely messages (which made me cry!) but then it finally felt as though that chapter of my life had closed and that i can move on. so, i have applied to the local cab to do some voluntary work and things have moved really quickly - i have an interview there on wednesday so fingers crossed! i have also re- started learning spanish - i began last summer but got distracted and now i'm trying to make up for lost time. it's great because i really feel as though i'm making progress this time around. i am also wanting to take up a new hobby. i used to do lots of cross-stitch but my hands won't allow me to do that any more so i am thinking of trying crochet which is not such fine work. so, we'll see how that goes. all in all i feel much more positive about things.
Male: 100%, Female, shaun white is 23 years-old now but only 11 in that clip, same age as my daughter. and – and! – he was born with a heart defect that required two open-heart surgeries before he turned one. despite that inauspicious beginning, he started snowboarding when he was six, won his second gold medal in these vancouver games, and is the acknowledged master of the sport. ever watch him compete? with the other snowboarders, both his own american teammates and the riders from other countries, there is sometimes a stiffness in their routines, a nervous quality that comes across even on television. incredible athletes all, and snowboarding tricks in general demand an uncommon kind of bravery and audacity of movement, but shaun white's fluidity almost makes them look wooden in comparison. when he goes on, he appears to be just playing. his performance is all, “hey guys, gonna have a little fun here now, k?” as he bounces around the halfpipe and, in the tradition of all athletes at the top of their game, makes it look easy.
Female: 100%, Female, if you lined up all the teachers and staff in my school in a search for who might possibly write a blog like this, i would be one of the last chosen. in my professional life, i don't make waves. i avoid conflict. i'm a "yes" man. i do what i'm told, but i love my job so it's not hard. in my personal life, i'm more opinionated and although i'm a deeply private person, i tell my friends and family exactly how i feel. few coworkers have crossed over into the actual "real life friend" category. so it's very easy for me to compartmentalize. before this project happened. now i'm feeling majorly exposed. i could absolutely lose my job over this. in just the first ten days of school lunches i've gotten a bigger response than i expected. it makes me nervous. most teachers do feel the same way that i do about the lunches served in the building. so that's reassuring. we've all discussed the lunches and how bad they are in passing. then we go back to teaching. no one has done much. i'm not a hero, but i am a whistleblower. but instead of calling a "tip line," i've shouted it to thousands of people. oops. 
Male: 100%, Male, this post is a bit of a historical retrospective, because it's only been recently that these things have aligned themselves in my head. the all goes back to jyrki kivenen and manfred warmuth's paper on exponentiated gradient descent that dates back to stoc 1995. for those who haven't read this paper, or haven't read it recently, it's a great read (although it tends to repeat itself a lot). it's particularly interesting because they derive gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent (gd and eg) as a consequence of other assumptions. in particular, suppose we have an online learning problem, where at each time step we receive an example x, make a linear prediction (w'x) and then suffer a loss. the idea is that if we suffer no loss, then we leave w as is; if we do suffer a loss, then we want to balance two goals: change w enough so that we wouldn't make this error again don't change w too much the key question is how to define "too much." suppose that we measure changes in w by looking at euclidean distance between the updated w and the old w. if we work through the math for enforcing 1 while minimizing 2, we derive the gradient descent update rule that's been used for optimizing, eg., perceptrons for squared loss for ages. the magic is what happens if we use something other than euclidean distance. if, instead, we assume that the ws are all positive, we can use an (unnormalized) kl divergence to measure differences between weight vectors. doing this leads to multiplicative updates, or the exponentiated gradient algorithm. (obvious (maybe?) open question: what happens if you replace the distance with some other divergence, say a bregman, or alpha or phi-divergence?) this line of thinking leads naturally to crammer et al.'s work on online passive aggressive algorithms, from jmlr 2006. here, the idea remains the same, but instead of simply ensuring that we make a correct classification, ala rule (1) above, we ensure that we make a correct classification with a margin of at least 1. they use euclidean distance to measure the difference in weight vectors, and, for many cases, can get closed-form updates that look gd-like, but not exactly gd. (aside: what happens if you use, eg., kl instead of euclidean?) two years later, mark dredze, koby crammer and fernando pereira presented confidence-weighted linear classification. the idea here is the same: don't change the weight vectors too much, but achieve good classification. the insight here is to represent weight vectors by distributions over weight vectors, and the goal is to change these distributions enough, but not too much. here, we go back to kl, because kl makes more sense for distributions, and make a gaussian assumption on the weight vector distribution. (this has close connections both to pac-bayes and, if i'm wearing my bayesian hat, kalman filtering when you make a gaussian assumption on the posterior, even though it's not really gaussian... it would be interesting to see how these similarities play out.) the cool thing here is that you effectively get variable learning rates on different parameters, where confident parameters get moved less. (in practice, one really awesome effect is that you tend to only need one pass over your training data to do a good job!) if you're interested in the bayesian connection, you can get a very similar style algorithm if you do ep on a bayesian classification algorithm (by stern, herbrich and graepel), which is what microsoft bing uses for online ads. this finally bring us to nips this year, where koby crammer, alex kulesza and mark dredze presented work on adaptive regularization of weight vectors. here, they take confidence weighted classification and turn the constraints into pieces of the regularizer (somewhat akin to doing a lagrangian trick). doing so allows them to derive a representer theorem. but again, the intuition is exactly the same: don't change the classifier too much, but enough. all in all, this is a very interesting line of work. the reason i'm posting about it is because i think seeing the connections makes it easier to sort these different ideas into bins in my head, depending on what your loss is (squared versus hinge), what your classifier looks like (linear versus distribution over linear) and what your notion of "similar classifiers" is (euclidean or kl). (aside: tong zhang has a paper on regularized winnow methods, which fits in here somewhere, but not quite as cleanly.) 
Male: 99%, Male, this afternoon i sat by the side of the road, waiting for the crosstown bus. i sat there for what seemed like forever, but was probably no longer than 20 minutes. i finally got so impatient that i crouched next to the bus stop sign, counting the seconds between a car appearing around the bend and it passing me. i also got to thinking... if i can't hardly wait 20 minutes for the bus, what's it like to wait six years from the time you retire to when you first become eligible for the hall of fame? what's it like, the anticipation? part of me thinks 'waiting for the bus' is a good analogy here. sometimes it's on time, sometimes you have to wait a little longer, and sometimes it never comes at all. a lot can happen in six years. whole lives can change (but there's the hall of fame ballot announcement date, circled with permanent marker on the calendar in the back of your mind). for some guys, it's a given that the hall will call (hey, that rhymes). guys like rickey henderson, greg maddux, craig biggio--these guys don't have to worry. but is too much emphasis placed on being an inductee in the first year of eligibility? it took duke snider eleven years of voting to make the hall of fame (first appeared in 1970, inducted in 1980), joe cronin ten years (1947-1956), don drysdale ten years (1975-1984), and bob lemon 13 years (1964-1976). and those players are just four examples. there are plenty of others. it's guys like jim rice, david concepcion, and dale murphy who get their hopes up, only to have them crushed year after year. and i guess i'll probably have to add fred mcgriff's name to that list in a few years. mcgriff becomes eligible next year (for 2010 enshrinement), and while i'll be pulling for him, these days 493 career home runs don't seem to be enough to hang your legacy on. 
Female: 100%, Female, soooooooooo i almost didn't make it to the gym tonight. my legs hurt with every step i took today; it didn't help that i slept in and got to work late so i had to park way back at the end of the parking lot. in the afternoon i was sitting at my desk and i thought i was having a heart attack because i had chest pains.... then i remembered benching yesterday. by the time i got home i was tired and sore and just a tad bit grumpy. i was making lots of hints that i did not want to go to the gym and i was just waiting for scott to fold and say lets not go because i didn't want to be the one to say it. well finally at 8:00 he convinced me to get my fat, lazy butt to get up and go and i was already thanking him for making me go five minutes after we got there. thanks again scottie so hottie! cardio 10 minutes on the elliptical going alternating between one intense minute at level 13 and and one recovery minute at level 6. try it.... 10 minutes may sound like a piece of cake but when you do intervals and push during those hard minutes it makes a world of difference! weights-- planet fitness has a 30 minute weight circuit with cardio boxes in between each one. we got a full body weight work out and did all kinds of jumping, lunging, squatting, stepping, hopping, and dipping in between. i was very nasty and sweaty which in my book equals a good work out. i highly recommend trying one of these cicuits if you gym has one or you can make your own my planning a workout routine with cardio in between.
Female: 100%, Female, so i'm coming out. i am not plus-sized, but any stretch of the imagination. i am one of those women that "mommy bloggers" love to hate: right this moment, at the age of almost 52, i am wearing junior size 5 jeans. this is 12 years after giving birth to the last of my six children. i doubt that any of my three readers will gush, "now i love you even more!" but i refuse to be ashamed of my size. not any more. i am a real woman. i think that carrying six children to term and breastfeeding them for over a year each -- and having them thrive on the milk my "inadequate" body produced -- more than qualifies me for real woman status, no matter what curves i may be lacking. i do not apologize for not being plus-sized, nor do i apologize for not even wanting to be plus-sized. sigh. i know. i'm supposed to be worried that my words might be construed as being "size-ist" and "intolerant", and completely lacking in "fat acceptance". i should instead be an "advocate for plus-sized women". i should drop my head in shame and apologize to people, "i can't help it that i'm thin. really. i eat twice as much as you, but i can't gain weight no matter how hard i try." but, you know what? that is simply not true. the truth is: i exercise. not fanatically, not three hours each day, not even consistently as much as i should to maintain the best health (e.g., the recommended 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise each day plus strength training to maintain muscle mass and healthy bones at my age). most days, i don't overindulge my appetite. i don't bake as a hobby and don't consume frequent desserts. the type of food i have grown to enjoy the most is relatively low fat and free of rich, creamy sauces. 
Female: 100%, Male, we had hoped we might have been able to go for a walk around the grounds with sam and a couple of staff when we visited today. jane had rung to try to arrange it yesterday. but just before we were due to set off we received a phone call from sam's named nurse, j. as well as smashing his guitar on thursday evening, on friday evening sam had slapped j's face and later thumped him in the stomach. he was unable to explain why he had acted in this way. he denied he had done it and claimed the mark left on j's face was a birth mark. so of course his leave has been cancelled again. it is lucky in a way - though not for him - that it was j. j is very experienced and genuinely wanted to try to understand why sam had acted in this way so reacted to it all very calmly and properly. the phone conversation though was very positive and both j and jane said how useful they had found it. sam was quiet but fine when we visited. a bit distant perhaps. friendly to start with but became more distant as we chatted. he mentioned slapping j but could not explain why - other than he was angry at being detained. he seems angry too at seeing us get older. perhaps it reminds him of having lost his youth in hospital. we have noticed too how he is aging more quickly - lines around his eyes and so on. no doubt effects of the medication. we worry the internal effects may well be the same.
Female: 89%, Female, do women really have more severe arthritis than men? are we more open or honest when answering questionnaires? or are we just more likely to complain? those are the questions raised for me by a research study published in the january issue of arthritis research and therapy (and the many subsequent news articles written this week). it's long been known that more women develop ra than men, in fact, 70% of people with ra are women. other gender differences have also been noted. both men and women have relatively equal disease activity (number of joints affected), damage to joint structure and deformities. however, while men generally have a higher incidence of rheumatoid nodules, higher mortality rates, and are more likely to be rf positive; women generally are more likely to have ra, have more severe symptoms, higher erythrocyte sedimentation (esr) rates and report greater rates of functional disability and work disability. other studies have found that men are more likely to have periods of remission. men have also been shown to have higher response rates to biologic drugs; but on the other hand, they also have higher rates of adverse events and serious infections with those drugs.
Female: 100%, Male, sara and i got to the gym tonight for a nice workout at the bsc westborough. i started off with a 2 mile run though i had intentions of running a bit further. i just didn't feel all that great and count myself as lucky to have finished the 2 mile run in 14:10 for an average pace of 7:04/mile with 280 calories burned. after running i lifted biceps and triceps. i did standing hammer curls, cable curls, cable rope pulldowns, cable v bar pulldowns and cable machine curls. in waiting for sara i ended up jumping on the bike machine and doing a 4.02 mile ride in 15:37.
Male: 100%, Female, whew! after hours of frustration, i have succeeded in moving this blog's template over into new blogger. i did my best to maintain the same look and feel, but there are subtle differences. (you can see the old template by clicking on the thumbnail at left.) and what a learning curve it's been. hopefully, the results will prove worth it. one of the major benefits of new blogger (and certainly my primary motivation in upgrading to widgets view) is the new labels/categories feature, evidence of which you can see at right below. those who have been with me for a while will be familiar with the various not-so-successful code hacks and workarounds i have employed over the years in an effort to give this blog that all-important missing functionality. i posted recently on the changes needed to get the 3-column minima template that i give away here working properly in new blogger layout view. that was a piece of cake compared to this blog's template, because of all the customization i had done. new blogger didn't like my classic template at all, and the easiest approach to feeding new blogger widget view something it could digest proved to be to rebuild it from scratch. i started with the 3-column minima template, but you can only get so far dragging widgets around the screen. to get the functionality and look and feel i wanted, i had to delve into new blogger's xhtml code, which is a whole lot more obtuse and less forgiving than old blogger's code. (tip: all tags must be closed, even img tags, or they will generate error messages.) 
Male: 100%, Male, it was about 10 years ago when carpal-tunnel first hit me. every time i put my hand on my mouse, i'd get spasms of pain in my various parts of my arm. i tried special ergonomic mice and trackballs, but they didn't help. i tried speech recognition software, but it was a joke. whether i could continue with my profession was becoming an issue. i even tried moving the mouse with my feet. nose mousing was next. then i discovered the wacom tablet. for a long time, it was a godsend. the pain almost went away -- but not forever. a couple years ago, the pain started returning. the wacom bought me some time, but it was not a permanent solution -- at least not by itself. somebody recommended i read pain free at your pc by pete egoscue. i'm glad he did. this book has saved my career (even though i'm not exactly following its advice). its main point is that carpal tunnel originates with the spine -- that is, a spine in poor posture. when standing straight, the spine is in an "s" curve. think of the neck, shoulder blades, lumbar and tail bone. when standing up straight, they are shaped like an "s". the spine is a balanced spring with the skull balanced on top. your arms are hanging straight down and your skeletal/joint/muscle system is at peace. when sitting with poor posture, however, the spine is in a "c" shape. the lumbar curve is gone or reduced. the spine is a cantilevered, stressed support for the head and arms. the spine, in turn, is supported by the small muscles of the back. but those muscles are meant to steer the spine and body, not support its weight. now, what's the connection between the spine and wrist pain? think of the song: "the head bone is connected to the neck bone..." in this case, the spine bone is connected to the shoulder bone, and the shoulder bone is connected to the arm bone. the bones and the muscles and the ligaments and tendons are connected. it's a system. when the spine is in a "c" shape, the body's structural support is out of whack. as egoscue puts it (i can't quote directly, i lost the book), a poor posture will gradually make your bones and muscles disintegrate turning your body into a pain-wracked, arthritic, crumbled ruined husk of its former self. of course, proper posture is the solution. but how do you make that happen? it's not easy, especially for slouch-meisters like me. egoscu's solution: yoga. as i understand it, yoga will strengthen muscles that usually don't get enough exercise. his book has a number of yoga exercises that are specifically designed for carpal-tunnel suffers. he has exercises for light, medium and heavy pc users. his approach makes sense to me. unfortunately, the story did not end there for me. i tried to do the exercises, but they hurt like hell. and they took a long time. and i don't have the discipline. i failed.
Female: 73%, Female, all of my trips to this southern philippine city had always been for business. my first visit to cagayan de oro city, or cdo ,as most filipinos refer to it, was a decade ago when i was there to hold a training workshop with the local affiliates of the organization where i used to work with. despite the fact that i had never been to this place during that time, i traveled alone as the advance party; an irony, now that i think about it. 
Male: 100%, Male, also remember the weakness to alot of computers is the actual web browser itself as well. every browser (and system) has its weakness. just google "pwn2own" the mac was hacked in under 10 seconds this year, and this was a fully patched system. every system has its weaknesses. as long as you're web smart about the links and sites you visit, you'll be fine. also if you have a good memory, use different passwords. i use about 20 different passwords (yes, i'm that paranoid :d) and each one of them has a different category e.g. personal, work, bank, mail, webservers, etc... the daft thing alot of people do is use the same password for everything, e.g. you might sign up to a website and use the same password you do as your paypal and e-mail accounts. bad idea!!! 
Female: 99%, Female, with only the moon and the stars to light our way, we stopped by a souvenir shop that glowed through its fire-lit lamp. the waves were our only reminder of our location. we walked along the beach with our bags in tow and rested at a medium-size open-air hut filled with soft lights. the sound of a big lizard kept our senses alert. 
Female: 100%, Female, i finally make it to the gate with only twenty minutes to spare. with so little time, it turns out i could have left my purse, book and bottle of water in the car and saved a lot of hassle. my mother comes off the jetway beaming like a little kid; she is so excited to be here. i grab her wheel chair and begin to push, all the while wondering, how after 358 days of travel i could have been caught by security twice. my, how quickly we do forget.
Female: 50%, Male, staying in a relationship when it is time to call it quits can lead to serious consequences for your health or well-being. stress, tension and anxiety can take their toll and it simply isn't worth it. if you are suffering in a bad relationship and there's no sign of improvement, then it is best to end it and move on. it is better to be alone and happy then to stay with someone who makes you unhappy. you owe it to yourself to find true happiness with someone who loves, cares for, and respects you. 
Male: 100%, Female, second-universal health care is not the answer. it's a larger problem. insurance companies have no incentive to save money to those they insure-the hospital passes the increased cost of the uninsured onto the insured. hospitals should start incentives to pay in cash. why should they bill you more if you pay in cash than they do the insurance company? 
Male: 100%, Male, that’s bansko, a bit rough around the edges but friendly and accommodating at its center. and for those who want to stretch their wallet in luxury this is the place. set in the southern bulgarian mountains close to the border with greece, bankso has always been associated with cheap prices, but now it’s becoming known for world class skiing as well. a crash in real estate speculation in 2008 has helped keep the prices down, but the residents of this former communist state kept themselves busy upgrading the town and ski area with the latest equipment and amenities. the speculation years left their scars in the form of half built hotels and high rise condominiums, but the old section of town was preserved reasonably well. there is still a rare lived in feeling to the old-town which makes a charming contrast to ski area and new construction just across
Female: 100%, Female, the weather in this part of the globe is once again changing. the slight chill in the air has ebbed away and philippine summer seems to be entering earlier than expected. it’s not really a sudden shift because in our tropical country, weather conditions could be rainy, normal (dry and warm), and warmer. most of the time, the sun would be out. 
Female: 86%, Male,  hi everyone. as you no doubt noticed, we pretty much shut down over the christmas holidays. i did this on purpose as i really wanted (needed) to focus on having an incredible christmas and some complete down time. in addition, i wanted to focus on launching my new book! i'm pleased to say that i was successful on all fronts. 
Female: 100%, Female, but by last week everything had changed. i received an email from someone named corie which i was about to delete since i didn't know a corie and certainly all emails from people we don't know contain virus' right? then i noticed that after her name came the phrase: thank you and package mailed and the mention of the name sharon. i backed up my computer to protect all my data before opening the email (not really) and there it was - a reference to my knife. sharon had given my knife to one of her guests, this woman corie from new york city, to mail to me upon her arrival back to the us. and sure enough, several days later, the knife arrived at my door step.
Male: 100%, Female, third-pharmaceutical companies in the us subsidize the lower cost of research drugs for the rest of the world-especially those countries with universal coverage. us pharmaceutical companies do all the r&d and fda approval process-other countires are then allowed to buy from the pharmaceutical companies in bulk-increasing their residents savings. allow pharmecutical companies a percentage cap of profit for us citizens say 10%-thus forcing them to reap their profits from the other countries around the world. make other countries subsidize their share of the pharmecutical companies. once they pay their fair share-they may not be so quick to tout the benefits of universal coverage. 
Female: 80%, Male, i spent the next eight years reading everything i could about tribal people who lived in the deserts, mountains and jungles of the world. in 2005, after living in argentina for five months, i was finally granted the opportunity to realise my dream by visiting a remote tribe in the javari basin of the amazon rainforest on the border between peru in brazil. after that i was hooked. in 2006 i visited nomads living in the remotest part of the moroccan atlas mountains. in 2007 i spent a month traveling independently in west papua on the island of new guinea then a week on siberut, one of indonesia's mentawai islands. my aim has been, wherever possible, to learn some lingua franca before i visit tribal groups so that i can visit them without a guide and can communicate directly with them myself. my style of travel on all of these trips could best be described as neither sight-seeing, backpacking or exploring but more just trying to understand different ways of thinking and viewing life and the world.
Female: 100%, Male, we need to stress good health at a young age.we need mandatory gym and phys ed through high school.we need children to bug there parents about not smoking in tight areas with them present,autos for one. we need insurance company's to allow for costs reflective of health.less cost for healthier people.more help for those who need it because of things beyond there control.ie:cancer,having never smoked,over weight because of a medical problem,again medical,not lazy.and stop free medical to illegals 
Female: 58%, Female, i'd dare say your not as good with women as you wish you were, you're looking for something that can take you above and beyond 99% of men for free, it's here, you just have to reach out and grab it 
Male: 80%, Female,  stan, you say you miss him and didn't even know him. not true. every day on this site, he shared a piece of himself with you and many others. you knew him well. you are right to be missing your friend. 
Female: 72%, Female, lots of things in life don't die but instead evolve or get reinvented. such is the case with this blog. this has been a great blog to write and we have had many dedicated followers over the past one and one half years. but now it's time to move on from this blog to... another blog. 
Female: 100%, Female, part of the spanish army came to the chapala valley and surrounding area. they were led by don alonso de avalos who arived in 1531 and set up the province of 'avalos' which included tuxpan, tuzantla, sayula and sahuayo. the spaniards also converted the native peoples to christianity. beginning in 1545, a large influx of spaniards arrived in the area and began to exploit the natural resources of the area. in 1567 the marquis de folces turned much of the land into large cattle farms. by the end of the 16th century much of the area was monopolised by the hacienda de guaracha. 
Male: 100%, Male, i’m in kosovo now! what do i do? don’t panic, go to your nearest cafe (they’re everywhere) and have one of the best inexpensive machiatos anywhere in the world. feeling better? good. now, all you need to do is plan your exit from kosovo by either flight or overland through another country (there are no flights direct from pristina to belgrade but you can fly from skopje, macedonia). if you want to get back into serbia overland your best bet is to cross into macedonia and then into serbia by bus, or a nine hour train ride form skopje.
Male: 100%, Male,  whenever you go to the our cancer group, you'll always see most recent blog posts first. just to the right of the latest blog post, you'll see two tabs; one for blogs and the other for discussions. if you want to see recent discussions, just click that tab and it will switch to the discussion. there's also a "view all" button for both blog entries and discussions so you can browse recent submissions from other community members. 
Female: 99%, Male, the rain eased off and a glowing purple and red sun began to set, apologising for all the stress and danger we had been through that day. the beach was empty, peaceful and calm. 
Male: 100%, Female, also-start a secure transmission database for perscriptions-that way people will not be able to forge signatures or visit tons or doctors to abuse perscription drugs. this would also cut down on potentially harmful drug interactions. or dosage mistakes due to sloppy handwriting. this will also cut down on the malpractice claims. 
Male: 100%, Male, he best way to protect yourself from computer viruses and remote attackers is to dedicate a computer to doing it for you, kinda like a network gateway for your home network. if you're the type of person that always worries about viruses and sensitive information being stolen but don't know that much about computer networks, i'd recommend using untangle (http://www.untangle.com/home-content-fil. ), very easy to install and can quickly protect you home network in minutes, there's also parental filtering with predefined filters if you're worried about what sites your kids go on. in the package you get a firewall, virus protection, spyware blocking, phish blocking, spam blocking, protocol control (blocks protocols for online games, im & p2p), reports and monitoring, all of this has automatic updating as well, plus its free :d. 
Male: 57%, Female,  how i missed that this time around. i miss his voice. and the new season of tv shows has started. 24 one of our favorites, is back with all cylinders firing. jack bauer and the gang had a huge two-night season opener, but there it sat on the tivo. no leroy to share it with. 
Female: 98%, Male, i was headed into an inferno, at least, that was what the news story on the internet led me to believe. it was old news really, i remembered first hearing about the fires burning across the peloponnesian peninsula when i was in rhodes a few weeks before. i had never even considered changing my plans due to the fires, though. after all, i had lived for many years in california where forest fires were commonplace and i was only going to get one chance of ‘seeing’ six of the seven wonders of the world before it was time to go home. 
Female: 51%, Female, everyone has their first time and they remember it: the anxiousness, the uncertainty, the wariness, but also the excitement at potential new findings, the rush of adrenaline, the majesty with which you are able to fling yourself into the great unknown. 
Female: 51%, Female, after we had our filling meal, we headed to a nearby cave, which had a very large opening. the cave was like a theater stage, large enough to accommodate a house inside. we were told that the cave is now considered biologically dead, brought about by the damage done by treasure hunters and the bright lights of the survivor shoot. 
Male: 100%, Male,  during our meetings, it became clear to me how entirely personal each volunteer’s experience in country can be. we read one submission on the issue of ‘hello.’ this word, one of the most common on the planet, is routinely shouted at volunteers country wide. the article itself was written by a guy in a village who described the practice as overwhelming, often shouted by grown men being intentionally obnoxious. 
Female: 100%, Female, hai, sasha here.to me, women was very easier to lose their weigth because everywhere we can saw no men in this world do housework accept forced. women was did the housework and its can be women was very easier to lose thier weigth....anything you want to commentttt??????? 
Female: 99%, Male, no this is not true. but what is, is we have a stronger will power. women have a tendance to cheat on their diets. i went on a slim fast diet and lost 50lb in 30 days, so it dose work and i kept it off for more then 6 years. and so can everyone. 
Female: 91%, Female,  no matter what measuring stick we use, we have all come here and found a place that is our safehouse. we can talk about death, we can talk about treatments, we can laugh, and we certainly know we can cry together. 
Female: 100%, Female, finally our dinner was served and we feasted on the local delicacies including grilled fishes. chatter filled the air with the sound of the sea providing a beautiful background. we met a german woman who was there on her own, embarking on the adventure of solo traveling, and engaged her to talks about the place. 
Male: 100%, Male, difficult question... first, no macs aren't the answer and im not a mac hater im actually using one right now. you need to understand no computer that's connected to the internet can ever be completely safe from viruses, trojans and worms but precautions like virus scanners or internet security suites help. i recommend mcafee and norton because there updated quicker and because they have extra precautions others don't have. you can actually get mcafee for free sign in or sign up for aol and go to downloads section they offer an aol enhanced version under the security tab. 
Male: 100%, Female,  a "lengthening tally of losses." that's how maureen put it into words in her comments to the blog yesterday. she was reacting to the news of randy's death. his name has been added to the others who have passed through our community. some stayed with us in time measured in years, or in randy's case, measured in weeks. 
Female: 100%, Female, arriving at noon, we were instantly mesmerized by the rustic garden at its front yard, as well as the sounds of the birds at the mini-aviary. the gravel pathway led us to a an archway of vines and tree branches hanging over the front door of the restaurant, which evoked a mysterious appeal to us. wood carvings, antique and art pieces, and dolls, caught our roving eyes. 
Male: 84%, Female, for those thinking about long-term travel, this is a great "how to" guide that will help you with the process. for those who prefer to live vicariously through other people's travels, this book is just one more way for you to enjoy yourself. either way, you should check it out at www.aroundtheworldineasyways.com. once there, you will discover a blog feature on this site and it is here where i will continue to blog. so come visit my new site and if you have particular ideas of what you would like me to blog about, leave a comment on a blog post or send me an email via contact the author. i would love to hear from you.
Female: 100%, Female, you should absolutely not stop eating. this could result in horrible things that are far worse than getting fat. just try not eating large portions, not buying so much junk food (or if you live with your parents, tell them not to buy much). maybe try eating on a diet like the acai berry diet, or even just choosing healthy foods. if you eat a lot of smaller meals throughout the day, and eat very slowly, you''ll feel full faster. when you feel the temptation to eat in between a 'meal', drink water. it fills you up, and it''s very good for your body. but please, don't stop eating, you need to eat, your body needs the fats, and sugars for energy. if you stop, your body will start to actually break down your muscles for it's nutrients, and you'll turn into a living skeleton!! :) i hope i helped you, i really do!!!!! 
Female: 100%, Female, finally, we departed the station and took the nearest freeway. since i got to see little as the bus entered the freeway i dozed off to sleep. i suddenly woke up in the middle of the trip and found myself staring at a beautiful lake surrounded by mountains. the scenic spot was very serene. i was mesmerized that it was too late when i took out my camera. i tried to read any sign that would tell me the name of the place and found a vista del lago signage. 
Female: 68%, Male, the crew disembarked us - hippies, german girls and big bags soaked on a remote rocky pier. eventually a few motorcycles arrived and propelled us through the rainy jungle, dropping us off on the beach at the other end of the only road on the island. 
Male: 100%, Male, visit serbia first. fly into belgrade, explore the country and then move on to kosovo where you can obtain an entry visa at the kosovo border checkpoint. just remember you won’t be able to return to serbia the same way if you get a kosovo entry stamp, so plan your flights carefully (e.g. fly into belgrade and out from pristina). or you can ask the kosovar boarder control not to stamp your passport…not technically legal but it works for a lot of people (including me just last week). 
Female: 100%, Female, finally, we entered the dining place where a row of filipino food was set on a table. for less than p400 (less than $10), we availed ourselves of the buffet offering. there was salad, crisp spring rolls, baked clams, beef viand, and chicken viand, among other things. 
Female: 98%, Female, “so, this is california without the skyscrapers and the malls,” i thought. we passed cities and towns like wasco, corcoran, hanford, fresno, madera, merced, denair, modesto, stockton, lodi, elk grove, sacramento, davis, antioch-pittsburg, martinez, and richmond until we reached emeryville, which was one station away from the last one – oakland. the train’s passengers were also diverse and i felt safe and grateful 
Female: 100%, Female, i hope someday i’d be able to come back to cdo, for the nth time, and try the white water rafting adventure. nevertheless, my first time was always memorable. it made me feel at home in cdo. that time i was there on my first trip, i didn’t worry that i wasn’t able to tour the whole city. i knew in my heart that i would keep coming back to this place after that initial visit. and i would surely visit limketkai again…and explore more restaurants…and do the white water rafting…and shop more. the list is endless. 
Male: 97%, Male, i handed my passport to the serbian police officer. he scowled, not from the encroaching cold, but because i was american and had kosovo visa stamps. thankfully, i also had a serbian entry stamp so there was nothing he could do but waive me through. a few kilometers down a windy country road i reached the kosovar border checkpoint.
Female: 97%, Female, the train ride was smooth. although there was more room at the second floor, where the dining lounge could be found, i opted to stay in the lower section with marylou. i later found out that the lower part was reserved for senior citizens and the physically incapable. but there i was with marylou, and the train conductor checking the tickets didn’t mind me at all, even when she got off at hanford. 
Female: 83%, Female, a small island was discernible from the distance, our destination for that day. for locals and divers, that was apo island, known for its rich underwater life. 
Male: 88%, Male,  during discussion of the article, however, it turned out each person in the room had experienced this phenomenon differently. my experience, in the city, was one of children, who seem to be just trying to see if the word they learned in school actually works, and then, lost in their excitement, repeat it ad infinitum. young women described it coming from teenage boys only once they’d past them, as a weird sexual cut, and the grey haired women amongst us (age being highly respected here) described largely no problems at all. 
Female: 67%, Female, i have just published a new book about our year long odyssey around the world: around the world in easy ways, a guide to planning long-term travel with or without your kids. 
Female: 100%, Female, running out the door to go pick my mother up at the airport, i grab a book and bottle of water - it could be a long wait. i find this incredibly great parking space and proceed to the ticket counter in order to get a gate pass; this is my mother's first time flying as a blind person and i feel it's best if i meet her at the gate. it's only been six months since i arrived to this airport from our world travels, but somehow, even in that short period of time, they've managed to rearrange everything. i find security and line up in my cue of five - where is everyone? isn't this the busiest travel time of the year? why did i leave myself so much time? as the tsa agent scrutinizes my i.d. and gate pass a light bulb goes off in my head, i've got a knife in my purse. i wasn't the one traveling, so why should i have remembered to take it out of my bag? i ask the agent if there is any place to leave it for an hour or so until i come back. his lengthy reply of "no" leaves me walking back to the car to drop it off. i'm not losing this knife after finally getting it back from easter island! 
Male: 93%, Female, guys do in fact lose wait faster, guys tend to have a higher metabolism and they are built to be able to gain more muscle than women i mean how many women do you see with an 8-pack let alone a 6-pack? 
Female: 90%, Female, last stop was the ship wreck. it wasn’t buried deep and could be seen from the surface. some of us circled the ship and found that the corals have claimed most of the ship. it has become a home to many fishes as well, reminding me of a scene in the animation movie, shark tale. 
Female: 100%, Female, the last time i visited cdo, again on a business trip and alone, i took my breakfast in this homey eating place where i also did a little shopping of beautiful household accessories and fashion trinkets. while waiting for my food to be served, i picked out a large native bag and a mat, among other things, paid for it and went back to the adjoining room where my order was invitingly sitting on the table. the shrimp linguine was simply delectable while i sipped the carrot citrus shake. how i loved it! 
Male: 99%, Male,  with our cancer, any of you can begin your own discussion or share your own story. for example, if you wanted to start a conversation about who's thinking of getting involved in a particular clinical trial, you could go to our cancer's discussion board, click the "start a discussion" button and begin a conversation about it. for example, liz l. has already started a discussion about chemo fog. or if you wanted to share a story of your experience at your first chemo session, you could create your own blog post by clicking the "add a post" button - and maybe even write other blog posts as you complete your treatment. that's why it's called our cancer -- it's a place where all of us can share our experiences in cancer world in a collaborative way. 
Male: 100%, Female, mrs. clinton, i work in health care and see many places where we can improve our system and still provide care for everyone. the first line of care should be the primary care physician (pcp). there are not enough doctors going into primary care to provide adequate care. the pcps we have are overworked and overbooked. i worked as a case manager in the emergency department of a major trauma center and medical school. we cater to many of our non-funded patients, and the number of ed visits would be greatly reduced if pcps were available to everyone. if people could get a same day or next day visit, or at least be able to contact their pcp by e-mail. 
Female: 100%, Female, i instantly liked the mall. some of the stores were located outdoors and not everything was housed in a giant air-conditioned building. it was modern with a provincial touch that made the ambiance friendlier than the ones we have in the capital. there was an al fresco area, but i think the mall has developed over the years since the first time i was there. i was glad i had that extra time with my friend because the day after, the workshop participants, including colleagues from our national office, started arriving. one of our hosts brought us for dinner at a steak house. the restaurant was dimly lit and cozy with a western feel, which, for a moment, made me forget that i was in the philippines. the dinner was sumptuous and we all had our fill. 
Male: 93%, Male, having lived in australia for five years, i am in favor of some form of universal health care system. i am one of the many un-insured with in this country and without having va benefits, i would be forced to go without health care or face great debt. being unemployed and disabled makes it even more difficult. 
Female: 100%, Male,  the pain and the side effects will be there like uninvited guests. they're hard to ignore, but i will do my best to do just that. so let's just remember all of our friends and loved ones who have had to deal with this dreadful disease, especially the ones we have lost, and enjoy all of the life and happiness that this special time brings. we must always remember that we are making memories that will help to carry us through the rough times to come. 
Male: 100%, Male, normally when you cross borders you only have to worry about a valid passport (don’t forget it needs to be good for at least 6 months), and your visa. with kosovo and serbia things get a bit more complicated. there is an ambiguous international legal rational for kosovo; a battle in the security council between the us, russia and china over sovereignty and self-determination; a unilateral declaration of independence by the kosovar government (supported by 65 countries in the world, but not the un); and the blanket denial of that independence by serbia, which maintains parallel government functions in parts of kosovo. by now you may be wondering if there is a border or not…there is…depending on who you ask.
Female: 80%, Female, women are built for fat storage to be able to survive & care for children during famine. their essential minimal fat stores are 5x higher than a males. women were built to accumulate as much fat as possible and to not lose the accumulations for childbirth, milk production & child rearing. having year around unlimited carbs to create fat are against the natural order. 
Female: 100%, Female, omg! no! some nurse at a hospital gave unethical advice to my grandfather who is diabetic to soak his feet in water and bleach to get rid of athletes feet cracked or dry feet. after a month of listening to this retarded nurse the bleach started soaking in the cracks of his feet and cause it to open more. later he got an infection and now has half of a foot. bleach is for cleaning and doing laundry only! please tell me you haven't tried this yet! 
Male: 100%, Male,  i was down in the balmy lowlands for what we call “culture committee.” between myself and a crack-squad of likeminded volunteers, we crafted a book of volunteer stories related to cultural issues and an entire curriculum to be presented to the new batch of volunteers during their training, set to begin in april. we sought to provide a palatable presentation of everything from cultural basics like removing shoes upon entering a house, to more complex, highly emotional issues, like bride kidnapping. 
Female: 99%, Male, finally we broke through to the calmer side of the island, the rain was lighter here, waves calmer, we could see the coast of thailand in the distance and everyone seemed to breath easier now we were sheltered on this side of the island. 
Female: 97%, Male, this was high season and spoilt and busy? we were soaked and there was no place to stay, yet after the noisy crowds of the other islands, this was a chance to exhale. 
Female: 100%, Female, we wanted to be at the taj by dawn the next day. this required us to leave all our belongs in the room until we returned to check out. i just knew that upon our return, anything of any value would be gone. the thought wasn't sitting well with me at all. then i noticed the latch on the outside of the bathroom; ideas began to percolate. i retrieved a pad lock, purchased in zanzibar, from the bottom of my bag. we placed all four of our suitcases and all four of our backpacks in the bathroom and then placed our pad lock on the outside of the bathroom door. yes, you're picturing this right. we were locking all our belongings in the bathroom. even if management had a key to the pad lock of our room, they still wouldn't be able to get into the bathroom. we left at 6:00 am for the taj mahal feeling a little more at ease. 
Male: 100%, Male, just over a week ago, reports surfaced that a toyota prius driver in san diego was driving along a highway when his car became unresponsive. police were called and helped stop the vehicle. in a press conference today, however, toyota officials said they found significant inconsistencies in the driver's story. toyota had engineers on hand to answer technical questions of reporters, who were also given test drives. "to say this situation was sensationalized would be an enormous understatement," mike michels, a toyota spokesman, said.the driver in question, james sikes, called 911 to report his prius was out of control and that the accelerator pedal didn't respond. a cop caught up with sikes as he drove up to 90 miles an hour. toyota officials inspected the car as well as did the national highway traffic safety administration. however, a report over the weekend indicated they didn't find anything wrong either.despite the discrepancies in the drivers story, toyota disclosed one potential issue: indication that he car's brakes were severely damaged from overheating, which would confirm sikes' story. also, according to the usa today, there was an indication in one system that the brakes and accelerator had been pushed alternately, as if he were having trouble. but other than that, michels said the toyota probe of the prius has found: 
Male: 75%, Male, men have more muscle mass, which burns fat therefore their metabolism is more active allowing them to burn off calories easier. also, men are socialized to want different foods than women like meats and starches, its not masculine for a man to crave a box of chocolates 
Female: 93%, Male, i have grown to appreciate the shopping options in singapore after living in some meager environments. however, skip the boring sameness of orchard street, where all you will find is high end shops carrying the same louis vuitton bags you can find back home. for something funkier hit the youth energized bugis street. packed with hip handmade clothing stalls and accessories, this is where you can find bargains and maintain a bit of personal identity and style. practice your negotiation skills, or just soak in the teaming market atmosphere as stall owners struggle to be noticed and shoppers hunt for the perfect friday night outfit.
Female: 100%, Male,  (day 701 on the road) after resting my tired bones from the nine-day hike i had just completed, it was finally time to pick up suzanne from the airport in queenstown. suzanne and i have been very good friends ever since we met at university in hong kong many years ago, and it was great to see her again (we had last met up in singapore some 12 months ago). she will be travelling with me here in new zealand for the next two weeks, and we both have been looking forward to this for a while now. 
Female: 100%, Female, sharon emailed me and told me that she would be coming back to the us in the fall for the birth of her grandchild; she would mail the knife to me at that point. but by this time i had lost all hope. it's not that i lacked faith in sharon, it's just that i had come to believe that my knife was destined to spend the rest of it's existence on rapa nui - not a bad fate if i must say so myself. 
Female: 83%, Male,  unfortunately, as all cancer patients know, you can never completely get away from your body's assault on itself. leading up to the book launch, my psa started climbing quickly, evidence the cancer was actively spreading. the day after the launch, i had another test and found it had jumped way past what it was when i was first diagnosed and we have been unable to pinpoint where it is growing, which is cause for much anxiety. in the meantime, the pain in my back is increasing. i tried another type of hormone in a bid to slow things down, but the side effects drove me off that after only a week. 
Male: 100%, Male, i think any universal health care plan would have to come with a income based scheme or means testing. if you can afford to pay for health care you should pay, however you would be able to recieve a percentage back through a medicare rebate scheme. 
Male: 100%, Male, as karen and jay mentioned, all signs point to speaker pelosi using the "self-executing rule" to deem the senate health care bill passed without a full vote on anything but the reconciliation package of fixes. house dems really don't want to have an "aye" for the senate bill's warts on their record (the "cornhusker kickback" ads practically write themselves.) but i would make two points: voters aren't aware/won't remember/don't care about parliamentary process; it will be passage or not, "yes" or "no" at issue in november. and political attack ads are neither nuanced nor given to dogged devotion to the truth. saying, "i didn't vote to pass it, i agreed to deem it passed" is hardly a line that will stick with voters, and it invites charges of kerryesque flipfloppery. if there's any risk in "deem and pass" (ezra klein thinks there is,) the fact that democrats are pursuing it is a strong indication the republican spook campaign succeeded. nate silver identifies ten house democrats who could plausibly face primary challenges from their left if they vote "no." interestingly, six of the ten are from new york (late filing deadline,) where the labor-powered working families party has threatened to withhold support.
Female: 98%, Female,  what she doesn't know -- until now, because she reads the blog -- is that she has made this winter bearable for me. that early morning frosty air clears the mind. i've been able to put one foot in front of the other and march down the canal path because she has been by my side and listened to my sorrow spill out in rants and tears and leroy stories and sometimes all three combined into one long walk. some days, the hurt has just poured out of me. 
Female: 100%, Female, with the high noon sun above us, it was time to take our sumptuous lunch at a nearby cottage. i took off my shoes and buried my feet beneath the smooth powdery sand. 
Male: 57%, Male, my time in oman also made me aware of how quickly globalisation is making the world smaller, less varied and less wild. by age 13, villages i had visited aged 11 had telegraph poles running to them, one quaint fishing community had sprouted a giant stone harbour and the dirt track that had served as the main coast road had a new tarmac highway under construction next to it. they were all changes for the better but they gave me the idea that in my lifetime there would be no more opportunities to explore or meet people who lived in a radically different way from me. 
Female: 100%, Female, are you going on a trip to a particular place for the first-time? will you be setting foot in a foreign and unfamiliar soil? this blog site is created for you. i have been to many places, and the first time i stepped into unfamiliar territory i had to feel my way and rely on what i have on-hand especially when all i had were travel books, maps and print-outs from the web. my friends and i make our own itinerary. it is truly advisable to check out anything about the place before going on a trip. yet, you need not necessarily hire a travel agent or tour guide to get you around every time you visit a place for the first time. a little help from locals can add spice to your first-time travels. it can give you the freedom to explore the place and enjoy the feeling of not spending much, based on my own travel experiences. you can take my word on some tips and information on the places i visited but feel free to be creative and be adventurous. i may offer some advice here and there but, as they say, “experience is the best teacher”. so, read on and find out more about my first-time travel adventures. 
Male: 85%, Male, this must have been serious storm as the deep-sea fishing boats were turning and heading for shore, their grey and hardy hulls taking cover for the night. 
Male: 100%, Female, sahuayo was affected by the cristero war of 1926 - 1929. the cristero war was the most significant relapse to violence and conflict after 1917. it arose from the clergy and traditionalist groups protesting the anti-catholic policies of the constitution. the constitution sought to secularise the country and limit the power of the church. the constitution prohibited the chucrh from aquiring land, banned monastic orders and church-run schools and forbad any religious activity outside view of the santuary of guadalupe of churches (now the property of the government). 
Female: 92%, Female, malatapay beach resort may be far from the city but it is accessible to the national highway. it has a beautiful location with cottages close to the sea facing apo island, a strategic spot to serve as a gateway to the tourist-attractive island. they have several cottages that can accommodate a large group (we were 16 all in all when we went there). 
Female: 91%, Female, once our trip was over, i figured our blog was over too. not that i really wanted it to end (the trip or the blog); it's just that in my mind, they went hand in hand. sure, people will check in to see great safari pictures or to hear about our trials and tribulations on the road, but who is going to check the blog now that we are here back in the us living our normal everyday lives. i guess there are a few people out there who might be interested in hearing about our reentry into "real" life, but probably not many. 
Female: 100%, Female, as we entered farmerbrown, the place was packed so we had to wait to be seated. i scanned the place and i could tell that the dimly lit restaurant was cozy enough. it has a charm that i couldn’t describe much in words. jazz music filled the air that balanced the chatter, which could be heard by the bar where friends and strangers meet up. near the tall glass window, families were having a reunion of sort. in the middle and at the other side of the restaurant, the ambiance was a bit subdued, where couples and small groups were enjoying their dinner quietly.
Male: 69%, Male,  when a partner isn't fully in the moment of trying to fix a relationship, the work becomes a one-sided affair. you need to be able to fully be there for your partner when you need to work through tough times. this might mean that you need to take a few days off work or devote certain times to discussing ways to fix your relationship. these times should be uninterrupted by work obligations or time commitments so that neither person feels rushed or distracted. 
Female: 98%, Female, and the young people, lots of them, not all sorority types either; young, fresh and still susceptible to the allure of so much manufactured glamour. ironically they and their indomitable youth add sauce and substance to the myth. they flesh it out and give it life. 
Female: 100%, Female, when i got off at emeryville, i instantly located the bus bound for san francisco. in less than an hour we were crossing bay bridge, passing over yerba buena island and treasure island. alcatraz and the san francisco city line came into view. we went around san francisco in six drop off points before we reached the shopping center. i even enjoyed the mini-tour around downtown, the financial district, and the wharf because i got to see other parts of san francisco that i hadn’t seen previously. time passed by so quickly. in a few hours, i was in sfo checking in my luggage. but i was glad that in my short stay in the us, i was able to embark on an amtrak adventure. 
Female: 98%, Female, it was a long drive and if we weren’t careful, we could have missed the small path at our left which leads to kusina salud. it would be convenient to go there by private vehicle because the restaurant was a bit secluded. 
Male: 93%, Male,  our cancer is open to everyone, so right now you can go to the site and poke around. if you'd like to participate, though, you'll have to be a registered member of npr.org. for those of you who have been posting comments on laurie's blog entries over the last few months, you're good to go; just visit our cancer and click the big blue join this group button. if you're logged into the site already, you'll join it immediately; if not, it'll ask you for you to log in first. 
Male: 88%, Male, yea its all about the muscle guys have alot bigger muscle index than chicks and are naturally more bigger or taller than chicks. they take a higher calorie intake which means sometimes girls might eat the same as a guy but when you look at it the girl will eat more calories than they should and the guy will be at the calorie level he needs because guys have higher calorie intakes than girls. well thats how i see it ;) but yeah muscle helps burn calories faster making you lose weight and gain lean mass. 
Female: 100%, Female, besides a couple shots of delicious meals and desserts consumed and neatly arranged market produce encountered during my travels, i rarely take many food photographs, but the next few weeks will find me photographing a variety of raw meats, poultry, and seafood for a new non-travel related client based in nigeria so i’m pretty excited about this venture.
Male: 100%, Male,  if the answers to these questions are mostly negative then it could be a sign that your relationship is on the rocks. it's certainly not healthy for a relationship to consist of frequent arguments, violence or demeaning behaviour. if you are experiencing any emotional, verbal or physical abuse, then it's definitely time to call it quits. 
Male: 100%, Male, this is quite remarkable. i may be wrong--and commenters are welcome to correct me--but i can't remember another ethnic or religious lobbying group publicly siding with a foreign country against the president of the united states...especially when the country in question is engaging in behavior that the international community believes is illegal. once again, every u.s. president since richard nixon has called for a freeze of settlements being built in palestinian areas, including east jerusalem, conquered by israel in 1967. aipac stands, with israel, against every one of those presidents. 
Female: 99%, Female, around me courses humanity, in all it’s incorrigible shapes and forms. i even find people like me, people you’d never expect to see here in the vegas of my media fed imagination. to my surprise there is no one particular type dominating here. i see one salon tanned bottle blonde in a tight short black skirt holding a cigarette but next to her, not with her, but sharing her milieu, is a french couple, perfectly parisian in their understated elegance. 
Male: 100%, Male, but this is different: israel is clearly in the wrong and, according to the petraeus briefing, it is hurting american foreign policy in the region. in fact, israel is doubly wrong: its non-stop lobbying for war with iran is also exceedingly dangerous (the us joint chiefs of staff have unanimously counseled against war with iran). the fact that david petraeus, a hero to many on the right, is concerned about israel's intransigence should give aipac and the neocons pause. it won't, but it should. 
Female: 98%, Female, what was even exciting in our coral garden snorkeling activity was we saw a tortoise swimming near us. we had to be careful not to scare it away or we might impose some stress level on this marine animal. 
Female: 100%, Male,  christmas itself was wonderful. it can be a very difficult time for someone with cancer as the disease becomes a giant elephant in the room and can often make it difficult to really enjoy the spirit of the holidays. when i was first diagnosed seven years ago, i didn't even want to have christmas as i didn't think we had anything to celebrate. but this year, we surrounded ourselves with family ( including friends we now consider as family) and had a wonderful time. having my nephew's two-year old son levi here provided that wide-eyed child component and my eighty-nine year old mother provided a link to a lifetime off christmas memories. it was the best christmas i've had for many years and was very important to me as i worry more and more about what the future brings. 
Male: 100%, Male,  there are two ways you and your spouse can separate: either with an informal separation or by a formal legal separation. an informal separation is basically whatever the two of you agree it to be. typically, one of you stays in the home you had previously shared, and the other moves into some other quarters. at this stage you normally wouldn't make any formal property division, but you would agree, informally, on some kind of working arrangement about possession of things like cars, the bank accounts, the credit cards, and the stereo.
Female: 98%, Female, we were at the union station by 6:30, an hour before the designated schedule. we walked over the counter to show my online reservation. i asked the guy manning the counter if i would have any difficulty with my luggage or if i need to check it in. he took one look at me and my bags (there was a trolley bag, a backpack, and a shoulder bag) and shrugged, “you’ll do just fine.” he also explained that there was one leg in my itinerary wherein checking in my luggage wasn’t an option, so it would be best if i would just carry them with me. anyway, there would be baggage compartments where i could deposit my things. 
Male: 78%, Female, i'd like to see every citizen of the united states guaranteed basic health care at reasonable prices. we claim to be advanced, enlightened, the best country in the world, and yet our citizens often go without medical care because they can't afford it - or can't afford the health insurance. the insurance provided through my job is a flat rate regardless of how many people it covers. i am single, no dependents, and yet my insurance premiums cost the same as a co-worker with a family of five. at one point, between jobs, i tried to get independent insurance coverage and was refused because of my weight. i was within their acceptable weight range (which was only 17 pounds higher than the upper "healthy" limit for my height), but because i had recently lost 30 pounds they refused me and told me to try again in six months, so they could "be sure i'd keep the weight off." i've visited insurance companies as part of my previous job. i've seen the 40 acre professionally landscaped site with walking paths and lakes. i've eaten in the executive lunch rooms and employee cafeterias that served better food than most restaurants i've been to. i've seen the three story fountains in the lobby, and i know one company in particular that as a matter of policy closes its doors at noon on fridays in the summer. when my premiums go to fund the insurance company's private fitness club, i have a problem. 
Female: 77%, Female, and that's it, remember these 5 key areas and your golden, you'll be miles ahead of 99% of guys out there and finally be able to attract and date that beautiful girl you've been spying on for the past few months. 
Female: 78%, Male, mr. ho and his business partner. if you see them at the train station you can trust them. maybe. but what a great story if everything went horribly, horrible wrong. the perks of being a travel writer. to my disappointment nothing happened except arriving safely at the zoo, ticket in hand. mr. ho and his young business partner are an unlikely pairing. he is tall, has salt and pepper hair and looks like he could be her father. they run the service 3 times a day, once in the afternoon and twice between 5:30 pm and 8:30 pm (one way only), and earn their money from buying tickets in bulk. it only takes 20 minutes and is faster than the public bus service. give them a try if you are lucky enough to emerge from ang mo kio station and they are parked outside.
Female: 86%, Male,  thanks again to everyone who's given us feedback on this project. and above all special thanks to both leroy and laurie - leroy for encouraging us to continue the community and laurie for helping us make it happen. this community wouldn't be here if it weren't for them. 
Female: 62%, Female, now don't get me wrong, women don't want you to walk up to them and immediately start acting like a sex crazed maniac, but they do want you to open up sometime. unfortunately most guys never realize this and assume that if they are friendly for long enough something sexual will *just happen*. the truth is it doesn't *just happen* unless you make it happen (remember women want to be lead). usually if you've met a woman out clubbing/through friends and have spent over 20 hours with her and you haven't yet kissed, your going to be a friend forever (of course this doesn't apply if you work/study with her). generally it's best to start flirting with a girl as soon as you're even slightly comfortable around each other (after knowing each others names). this sets the tone of the interaction immediately and lets her know that you are a sexual guy who she could possibly date, not another guy to be placed into the "just friends" category.
Female: 100%, Female, should have the gallery up in a few days. not sure how i’ll photograph vienna since the last time i was there, every boring angle of statues, buildings, and museums was duly captured on film. yes, the property was lavish, attention was paid to every single detail, and the staff was extraordinarily warm so trying to pick apart the hotel and keep digging for negatives when there were clearly no significant misses would be an injustice on my part – personal preferences aside. 
Female: 99%, Male, i am slowly trying to get back to writing regularly and am hoping, in the next few days to take time off and at least write small pieces. over the last few months, i had some big, hairy audacious ideas for blogs but never could translate them into an actual post. clearly because i was lazy to sit in one place for long enough to complete them. but i also believe it has to do with the medium - a blog, personally, gives you just one shot at getting it right. i have never re-written any of my blog posts or re-read old ones in an effort to make them better. once they are written (after minor changes and re-writes, immediately afterwards), they are set in stone. 
Female: 100%, Male, i never fail to pull her leg at any given circumstance.. i jus luv doin so, 1a ma fav passtimes but puttin tut aside, v always join hands wen it cums to teasin others... some of our fav targets are supa (upas of our cls), raam's ( my fav staff ) n sats (jaya's fav staff).. gosh, wat fun v ve every minute of the coll hr!! she's a power house.. but even this power fails once our former hod's cls starts n guess who saves her wen she falls asleep.. me o course wid the most transparent lie tut she aint in gud health.. imagine!! jaya n unwel..lol hey guyz.. jaya's on diet..sheesh machan, ve a heart.. poi solluradhukkum oru alavu irukku.. every consumable thin isthe most delicious fud in her sight includin bitter gourd..n i've wanted to ask u this.." how do u find curd rice so yummy every single day??### (cont)

Male: 100%, Male, arvind from bangalore says, brian lara has called for the establishment of a centralised academy for the various cricket-playing islands in the caribbean to groom young talent. lara said west indies relied too much on the natural ability of players. have west indies always had poor infrastructure? if so, how did they manage to dominate world cricket in the 1970s and 80s?
Female: 100%, Female, so, i've been asking k for a new ring with my birthstone in it ever since my old one got yucky and gave my ring finger a weird looking wrinkle. he has tried all techniques that husbands employ -- agreeing and then pretending that he forgot, plain dilly-dallying, pretending to focus on blank spot with more intensity, changing the topic to li'l r (this is a good one, i fall for it almost all the time), asking me about myself or my blogs (this one works well too), throwing in random related questions, "yeah, you think we should check out the rings in the mall?" and then, "what's for dinner?" he is too smart to refuse because he knows the consequences of said refusal but at this point i am weary and annoyed that my delicate ring finger still does not sport a glittering sapphire (or whatever my birth stone is) ring shining with the promised love of our marriage. and so, i tried a different tactic the other night:
Female: 100%, Female, once a software engineer, now a full time mom having fun with my two year old:)i believe in making young children learn through play. just like we sneak veggies in the food, you sneak something on to the head while playing:)so, this blog is a collection of all the activities me and my son do together. thanks for stopping by and if you do try some of these with your kids, let me know:)
Male: 69%, Female, hy does this happen? because, men don't cry or break down. instead, the more upset they are, the more they frown or the angrier they appear. now, we all know women are more attractive than most men. and, nobody feels sorry for an angry man. in fact, the angrier he gets, the uglier he looks, the more despicable he appears. what choice does he have really? if he cries, they'll call him sissy. they'll say he's wuss. and it's not really macho. so he does what he has to. pretend he's got buffalo-skin.
Female: 100%, Female, wow. deep breath. i have so much to tell you, evidently. today we went for sunday lunch at the polo club, owned by the drummer for the who, and then, ronnie wood walked in. (i'll give you a minute. did you hear crickets? i did.) ronnie wood is one of the guitarists for the rolling stones and okay, so it wasn't mick jagger, but it was still quite exciting. jc's mother pointed him out to us, with his very young girlfriend and do you mind if i segue into a little rant about the english girls i've been seeing with very bare legs and shoulders and how i look at them with horror and envy, half wanting to be them, confident that it isn't really thaaaaaaaaaaaat cold, or be that age again, when vanity took precendence over comfort.

Male: 100%, Male,  do not be so dejected.this is the layer which has been created by him,ie,mr gadkari.this team will be given responsibility to deliver those who fail may even be replaced in the days to come. a pessimist is one who ses the darkness in the light.an optimist is one who sees the light in the darkness so be optimistic about the outcome people choose whom they wish to choose, and not the names.the performance makes the people to choose the party.names that matters-then does not matters.see how mr mani shankar iyer has lost the election this time, and how after losing the battle in the first count,mr chidambaram won the battle after recounting do not be so broken.these are the early days.more wopuld follow 
Female: 100%, Female, don't know why i am writing this.. but i feel like writing this...why is that everytime i read a post here, i am relating it with a page in my life? why is that every time, i m reminded of my dad or mom when i read anything out here.. reason- all of us- we go through same phases in life.. emotions are the same! bt the bizziare thing abt this post is tht- i have never had much friends too.. i was, guess all the time, in my own world.. at school- nt many kids used to talk to me- coz i always used to in these music or drama kind of activities.. for some reason other kids found tht to be some kind of strange thing.. i was an alien species among the "mark/grade hungry" crowd... it became the opposite while at college! so, i have never had much people whom i could call friends..

Male: 100%, Male, what a game! it was one of the best final's i have seen in a while and india played brilliantly to clinch the first twenty twenty world cup defeating pakistan. so the record of not losing to pak in any wc still holds. watched every ball of this match with nail biting excitement. india has this knack of putting themselves in difficult situations when it should have been an easy wrap up. during pak batting the game was mostly in india's favor except for the last 20 balls when bajji and sreeshanth were hit for 5 sixes. when will india learn to bowl well in the last overs? but they held their nerve and pulled it off. hats off to dhoni and the young indian team!!! they really were winners!!!

Male: 98%, Male, in real life, alice struggles with the burdens of impending adulthood, seemingly unable to fit in with the standards of society. moments after being proposed to, alice falls back through the rabbit hole. it is prophesied that, in order to defeat the red queen, alice will side with the white queen (anne hathaway) and kill the jabberwocky (voiced by christopher lee). however, there is doubt over whether alice is the "real" alice. the white rabbit doesn't believe she is, while the mad hatter (johnny depp) wholeheartedly believes alice is indeed the "real" alice. 
Male: 100%, Male, super star rajni next movie "enthiran" with ace director shankar and his dream crew has begun shooting recently......so i thought let me put my insights about the movie and do strength weakness opportunity threat(swot) analysis about the movie....i dont want the readers feel that i will be biased in doing this analysis as i have a penchant for rajni....i assure that it will be done in a neutral manner... strength: the greatest strength of the movie is rajni-shankar-rahman combination,this combination has been a great success in "sivaji" and they proved their mettle in that blokbluster.technical crew for "enthiran" is one of the strong points for the movie.....ratnavelu for cinematography,anthony for editing,yuen woo ping who handled stunt for many hollywood movies like crouching tiger hidden dragon, matrix and kill bill has been roped in for "endhiran". weakness: writer sujatha's demise is one of the weakness for the movie.....he has been instrumental in shankar's success since "boys"...it is also believed that story of enthiran was written by him...one of the weakness of "sivaji" was it lacked a coherent story,the same can be repeated in enthiran....aishwarya rai roles in recent movies except "guru" were very lackadaisical....hope shankar provides a meaty role which has a scope for acting.....

Male: 60%, Female, so many times in life mom had come across groups of individuals who would come and advise her on how to do things. then another will say whatever she had been doing would be wrong and that she has to start over. at different points in time in life. now there are people that tell me that i should not be on this blogging/tweeting scene and that there should be more exclusivity. and that a musician needs to maintain the distance. sometimes i feel that they are right. considering some comments i get, i wonder why people are so obsessed with obscenities and the related but why should i be subject to all this is their question. yes it does make sense several times. but if and when i don't blog, it would perhaps be because i have tired of this medium of expression and there would be a proper goodbye. i don't see it happening for now but the thing is, no matter what you do, there will be tons of free advice. and in oscar wilde's words "i alwayspass on good advice. it's the only thing to do with it. it is never any use to oneself."

Female: 96%, Female, the couple decided to get married at court and have a day long party after that. we met small and mr small (who really deserves his own name here, but i can't think of one at the moment, so mr. small it is) at one of london's oldest pubs, the prospect of whitby. so old that it even has its own wikipedia page! coolness. the pub was delightful, we had the upstairs 'pepys room' all to ourselves, a wedding party of about twenty people, foreigners and indians and it overlooked the thames. interestingly, the room we were in was once used for cock fighting and boxing matches, which made me think of sherlock holmes , which in turn made me think of robert downey jr with his shirt off. good times.

Male: 100%, Male, i took some heat in e-mail and here on our comments section for my recent piece about what i saw as fanboy whining over the captain america casting process, and i want to clarify something... i don't think fandom is a bad thing. i think it is the thermometer by which we measure the passion for various properties or characters, and that's a great thing. i also think fandom, when focused, can be an incredibly valuable force in the process, and this is one of those times. i think it becomes "whining" when you're second-guessing something you can't accurately judge because you haven't see the materials, when you don't know how an audition went, or when you simply leap to a conclusion from an emotional place. in the case of norton's banner, you already have some sense of what he brings to the role. the real question now is, "do you consider him a piece of the puzzle, and do you want him back?" if the answer is yes, then i think it's time to clearly communicate that to marvel. 
Female: 100%, Female, hehehehhhhuhuhhuuhhahhahahhhaa oh shit! hehhehahahhhahhahahah chuck it! hhohhhohohhahahahahhahaahhah. thts rad for u. my substitute sis in atlanta :) rad is a fun loving devil child who can laugh till her insides explode. thats a good thing though coz the jokes she cracks can seem funny to none but her!! shes a simbu fan ( i still dunno who that is!!) my tamil tuition teacher and a gal who jes luvvs dressing up. no tuesday or thursday is complete widout us going to raid the klaus kitchens of all the hot chocolate available! must say the hot choc definitely helps stem the flow of her polambal on special prob. shes also my suttufying partner n ive lost count of the number / value of items we've flicked from career fair n the no. of places we've had free pizza (in other depts!!) if u ever stop by her place, she'll neva let u leave wid an empty stomach, if not dinner ull surely get some cold coffee.. she cooks amazing dal. ohh n if u ever wanna spot her in atlanta, luk for the phataak red shoes she wears. :p
Male: 100%, Male, chelsea v liverpool - live on espn at 21:25 ist on sunday it will be for the 17th time that these 2 sides will be meeting since rafael benitez became the liverpool manager and since then they have won only 5 times n chelsea have won 8 times. liverpool currently struggling for good results will be without their star striker fernando torres, who is suffering from a hamstring injury but is expected to return for the champions league clash against inter in 10 days time. also missing will be voronin, arbeloa, aurelio and agger. xabi alonso is suspended. babel too might miss due to a knock he picked up during the midweek while on international duty. chelsea will be without terry and shevchenko while lampard and mikel could be playing. i hate to say this but chelsea may win comfortably unless liverpool put up a spirited performance to at least manage a draw. prediction - chelsea 1 - 0 liverpool manchester united v manchester city - live on espn at 18:55 ist on sunday one of the biggest derby games in england is the manchester derby. manu have lost thrice this season and all of those came when rooney did not play. rooney will miss this game due to suspension. also missing from united squad will be evra, neville and saha. duo of corluka and elano are suspended for city and richards is also likely to be rested after knee complaint. zimbabwe forward benjani will be making his city debut. city have not won at old trafford since 1974 and this year too wont be different. having lost 3 - 1 to arsenal at home, city have almost no chance of winning at old trafford. prediction- manchester united 3 - 0 manchester city
Male: 100%, Male, vk murthy, the ace cinematographer has been awarded the dada sahib phalke award this year. the highest honor reserved for the film fraternity by the establishment. generally and till now, mostly it has been given to decorate better known stars and directors, never a technician. this has been a departure and therefore i am all praise for the award being bestowed on vk murthy, a generous kind and humble human, one with whom i had the great pleasure of working in two films - nastik and ram balram. but i do not consider myself worthy of his genius. his most important works i believe were in films made by another genius, guru dutt.
Male: 100%, Male, new zealand batsman brendon mccullum is keen to put the lessons learned from a difficult 2009 ipl into practice during this year's tournament. mccullum is in the middle of a home series against australia. new zealand lost the chapell-hadlee series 3-2 and the teams will meet in wellington on friday for the first of two test matches. with the 2010 ipl successfully underway amongst security fears, mccullum is still waiting on clearance before confirming his involvement but was eager to participate in the competition because of its massive impact on the cricketing world.

Female: 55%, Male, that was a very interesting and nice write-up. i could relate to most of the incidents/things mentioned but i have come to the conclusion " you cannot please everyone and you also dont have to please everyone". people will be there to advice,complain or comment whether you do things right or wrong....if someone very close to you offers advice/suggestion, it is worth pondering as they (this person ha ha)might see things differently....for the rest, just listen and move on!!
Male: 100%, Female, firstly, i congratulate you on winning the prestigious booker prize. it is a remarkable achievement indeed for a young first-time novelist. i started reading “white tiger” but was straight away baffled by a work in english that begins, “neither i nor you speak any english, but there are some things that can only be said in english”. why would a major work in the english language adopt the epistolatory voice of someone who does not know the language and be addressed to someone else who does not know both english and the language spoken by the letter writer, i wondered. but, that is not why i am writing to you. i have read much about how you came to write this book. you have been quoted as saying,” so, where's this shining india everyone's talking about? it was time someone broke the myth," and that “the world needed to see the other side of india." 
Male: 100%, Female, it makes me uncomfortable when people talk across cubicles in restrooms. i don't know if men do this as well. i know some women at my office who are "restroom buddies". they enter the restrooms chatting away about something and continue their conversations from the stalls as they do their business. no matter that they might not even be in adjacent stalls! for someone caught in the crossfire of this talk, it is totally awkward. can't they wait until after they've left the restrooms to talk?

Female: 100%, Female, it is a quiet friday morning. sitting by the window in his bedroom, sankaran watches the street bustling with activity. men hurrying to work, children walking to school, and women, busy with their daily chores – some sending off their husbands and children, a few rushing to work themselves, some getting back from the temple. he also sees the old men and women warming up their feet for the day. even as the world goes on with its life at a hectic pace, sankaran has very little to do, at least that morning. 
Male: 100%, Male, our country celebrated it's 62nd independence day today.the main essence of celebrating the independence day is to remember our heroes who fought for our country to gain independence from the hands of british.but is it the real case happening in our country.it's really a question to ponder. when we start from school life,the students are asked to come to the school and some chief guest will come and hoist the flag and students will clap.then the chief guest will be rendering some useless speech and students should clap for it and they will be given a chocolate and return home so that they can spend the other part of the day happily watching tv shows and movies telecasting in it. when you take the tv channels instead of putting shows on how india got freedom or at least a film taken on patriotism they will be telecasting a film of masala genre.so the children don't know anything about the national heroes.so the gen next would also be knowing anything of the national heroes and slowly the main essence of independence day is being forgotten.and it will be considered most of holiday than a day of remembering our heroes. the worst of all this someone given to pinup the flag in his shirt and he is doing it outside.even the political leaders exchange wishes only and instead of remembering their heroes they will be thinking of how to impress the people with the help of this day by giving some useless speeches. worst of all this is vodafone which charges for sms on special occasions stopped charging on this day and that tells the significance of the day.

Male: 100%, Male, most tools will let you convert a partition from one file type to another, i.e. from ntfs to fat/fat32 or vice versa. needless to say that in most cases, such a conversion, especially from ntfs to fat/fat32 will cause the files to lose their ntfs permissions (acls), and in some cases where efs was used to encrypt the files, it will actually cause you to lose access to these files. so beware! some of these tools may be able to help you recover deleted partitions, and if data on that disk was un-damaged, actually help you gain access to that data. some, but not all of the tools may have the ability to move existing partitions from one location on the disk to another location, again, without losing data.

Female: 100%, Female, that's how r~ says "happy" when the "happy birthday" song plays on tv. when i turned 30, i acted like the typical drama queen -- resisting, reminiscing, wondering how this chunk of my life would turn out. but the big three-oh turned out to be fine mostly and in addition to a little love bundle in my arms, i managed to get a book out there. check, check (as monica would say). and now, i am at that crossroads again wondering what this year will bring. a published novel would be nice. it would be reaaallly nice. and then i would be one of those cool moms who could claim that they took care of their baby while working from home on something they were passionate about. but, i am not that mom now. i am just a mom who is turning a year older who is dreaming big dreams while her little one continues to throw delightful little challenges her way and melt her heart with her love (i could talk a lot more about r~ but i'll reserve that for my secret mommy blog ;)

Male: 100%, Male, i am afraid i dont agree with you! with your suggestions it will become congress 2! why do we want another congress pretender? office holders and tickets should be only given to people who succeed on an internal competition irrespective of caste or religion what you have proposed is internal reservations to christians musllims obc's and dalits! a shadow cabinet is a good idea! the important change we need is no wishywashy principles they should nail their colours to the mast and campaign for uniform civil code, abolition of sec 370, abolition of caste politics, abolition of minority appeasement abolition of reservations and sops, and treat all indians equal!

Female: 100%, Female, there are a few things which characterise my friendship with anoosha - 1) we simply have to fight every week. if at all we miss one week, we'll have an extra ferocious fight to compensate . this constitutes the most important part of our bonding 2) we also have to have a mutual ego boosting session, where we compliment each other( coz noone else seems to do so) 3) we have to text each other everyday, even the most inane details of what we're doing- "i'm in the bus", "i'm in the train", "i'm bored", "so am i" etc. if this doesn't happen on a day to day basis, read point (1). dishoom dishoom probably the best thing about my friendship with her is that i don't have to pretend..i can straight away say to her face what i think of her, and she returns the favour too :) i personally feel that no relationship/friendship is ever complete without a fight, because you require that intimacy even to fight..that said, i'm gonna miss our weekly fights when this idiot runs away to do her ms. love u!
Female: 100%, Male, had been on a cabin trip weekend of sep 20th. the cabin was about 2 ½ hours drive from seattle. what started out as a 10 person trip eventually came down to 4. you know how these things go. people dropping out at the last minute with some excuse or the other. i also tried my best to get out of it but with no luck. what was my excuse – well i had none – that was the problem. i have no complaints now. it was four guys in a cabin all by ourselves. now don't jump ahead of yourselves and get the wrong idea.

Male: 100%, Female, listless eyes fixed aimlessly on the road. the dry hum of the ac blowing on my face. one long never ending road. the slow monotony of a highway drive. many kilometres covered. mindless music crooning in the background. every mile seemed to me like the road was gobbling up human beings, villages and vehicles alike. the road swallowing the people and things that it passed by in seconds. the car swallowing the road as it moved ahead. the vicious cycle kept replaying before my eyes and suddenly brought a memory to the forefront . a memory that tore its way from that place , deep inside mind, where it was locked away for eternity. the loud screaming thoughts rudely shook my reprieve and replaced the stoic silence of my mind.

Male: 97%, Male, the next morning when swapna logged in she had forgotten completely about the surprise and they were chatting about random things as the conversation went by. ram did not bother to remind her either. swapna quickly typed, “we are going to have a huge bash for anisha’s birthday tomorrow at her place. we couldn’t have a party that day ‘cos she had plans with her family.” ram exclaimed, “wow, that’s awesome sweety…. so, you are gonna be at her place all day tomorrow eh?”. swapna giggled to herself and replied, “why do you ask like you’re going to come to the party? ;)” ram sighed heavily on the other side and keyed in, “how i wish babe… how i wish……” they continued and she went on and on about what she had planned for the party. ram was missing all the action and he felt bad about it. ram typed out in frustration, “damn! semester ended yesterday and if only i could afford to get to india :( :(.” swapna asked anticipating a positive response, “is there no way you can come now?” ram made a quick and short reply, “nope.” swapna was now asking ram what else they could do. swapna asking him for some ideas for the party. ram said his mood wasn’t ok and he logged off. swapna tried to persuade him to stay, but, he refused and left. swapna was missing him online and she was suddenly reminded of the surprise that he had promised. she was now very curious to know what it was and she called him. the conversation was very terse. ram answered the call and in a very depressed tone replied, “i will call you tomorrow. i know you were reminded of the surprise i promised you. i’ll let you know tomorrow. waiting at times increases the value of the surprise. hold on to your curiosity sweety.” without waiting for her to reply, he hung up.

Male: 100%, Male, but the stock market crashed once the interim budget turned out to be a damp squib. what else would you expect from a substitute (pranab) of a substitute (manmohan) of a substitute (chidambaram)? it should have been manmohan all along. in his defense, pranab argued that he did not have the mandate do anything more with the budget. no mandate? does this mean prakash karat is the one we should be blaming? pranab termed his interim budget as one for the ‘aam admi’. unfortunately, for the ‘aam admi’, the government is now the ‘baam admi’. did you read about that? a farmer in rajasthan claims that an army aircraft bombed his 5 bhiga field and home. no statements from the army. guess the iaf’s policy is not to ‘kisaan-and-tell’. or it’s in a real kisaan jam. or it doesn’t think it’s that bhig-a deal. take your pick.

Male: 100%, Male, o'brien got the live show started as a way to help his staff of about 40 keep busy and employed. nbc gave up an extra $12 million for the staff. considering that the staffers uprooted their families and pulled their kids out of schools in new york and moved them across the country -- only to see nbc end conan's tonight show run after only seven months, they deserve whatever extra gig they can get until o'brien resurfaces behind a desk for another network. in new york, the tour hits radio city music hall and madison square garden in june, venues that sold out quickly. hey, maybe conan will return to gotham when he lands the next job. things were going great for him until he left. 
Male: 71%, Male, i n pravin wer skool classmates, very cool guy.. never gets tensed.. very quiet. enjoys roaming around in our home town. gud companion while roaming, we also take "the terror" janesh and "dirty dog" alan and "raddy" pradesh n praveen with us.. used to play cricket very well.. he bats stylish and bowls like mc'grath. girls define him as sweet person.. has a lot of fans due to his character...
Male: 100%, Male, between 2 friends, maybe very close or may not be close, they could just be friends. assume that the guy has feelings for the gal all of a sudden. like i said before, the guy decides to tell her. "hey, i have started feeling differently about u lately... blah blah.... this is off topic" the gal if interested says 'yes' and all is ll. omg here comes the other if. no??!!?? ok now wats the next step. i have commonly seen the gal starting to distance herself from the guy. cmon give him a break he is not gonna stalk you. guys give her a break. she said no which means any amount of hanging around doesnt work. so give up and atleast be sane enough to respect her feelings and her space. if you are very close friends, give it a small gap, may be one or 2 days, call back and just be normal. do not attempt to talk about wat happened unless u r sure, both u and her are comfortable talking about it. otherwise, its best to avoid it. agreed it is tough to start with. a few days, and u will be back to comfort zone and then probably, u will be able to discuss it in the lighter vein. ok, here goes. what is it about expressing love that people think its an offense? the guy had an 'opinion'. i use the word opinion just because its just precisely what it is. you go thro this phase where you think a person is special to you. hence, its an 'opinion' you form about the person. freedom of speech/ expression(this i know is not applicable completely to something of this kind) but, i want to use this to play down the misconceptions surrounding the 'opinion'. the girl, you will accept/not accept an opinion about a car, bike, house, etc...etc... when the guy says it. why is it when this opinion is expressed and then asked about ur take on it... you get so offensive?? he just said he loves you and wants you to be his 'one'. just say whether you agree or not and get moving along. yes, again a play down on the whole concept of expressing love.
Female: 100%, Female, okie arch felt a lot that i dint write much in her slam book .. so making it up 2 u this way .. wat to tell about this sweet samathu angel faced gal ( i mean it really u know ) well lots because as the saying goes appearences are deceptive . the only one in the a gang who holds the record for never getting caught in class inspite of sitting next 2 shah .. what she does , well i doubt if she knows herself . to talk archa's trademarks , bad bad handwriting , few salwars that atleast one other person will own , some so different that they can give ksh's designer wear a run , matching earrings to give appu competition. very tolerant person ( after all she tolerated the third one for many sems and had nightmares resulting from it ) . no one can beat her in word racer , though i doubt her counter strike abilities . snoopy like nancy drew which provide good base material for gossip .. her luck ( well i would rather not remind her of it ) .. wat els movie buff book-a-maniac and pakki of first order
Female: 100%, Female, pre-r (which is how i am going to call my pre-parent days), i used to notice one common characteristic among parents. whenever they had their baby with them, they would try to convince the baby to do something fascinating like saying the alphabets or singing a song or even dancing a particular piece. it almost never worked. the kid would look shy and hide behind the parent or would just look blank and do nothing. i would excitedly wait for the kid to do its wonder but couldn't help wondering what made the parents want so desperately for the kid to perform. i believed them, that the kid can say its alphabets or sing a little jingle or tap dance; then why the attempts to coerce the unwilling kid to do that?
Female: 100%, Female, its like yesterday, but i can still remember the day i first met you.it was august 19,2005 around noon.we were all gathered for the first year's orientation day.at first sight itself you waved at me like a very old friend and introduced yourself to me and i was amazed.this is how it all started. i never thought i would be really this close to you as you had many friends in college. but you took the initiative and made sure that i was comfortable with you. sumi can read your mind just like that. a very true and a loyal friend to have. she is unpredictable at certain times. dont try to mess up with her feelings. just accept the way she is and you will be really surprised to see a very different person altogether. she can be silly and intelligent at the same time. i wonder how she can watch a movie all night and still manages an 80 in the next day's test. she makes a boring class very lively by her constant doubts. hey sumi you are the best i have ever had.i will do my best to make you feel the same way!..

Male: 100%, Male, james bobin is on board to direct the movie, the plot of which is under wraps. the tv show as well as some of the movies tended to have one key human actor with whom the muppets associated on their adventures. it is known that segel plays a man on a quest to find and reunite the muppets. the actor's coming aboard is a natural extension of the development process; he wrote the script with pal nicholas stoller. segel has been on a tear with feature work of late. he recently boarded the cameron diaz comedy "bad teacher" and last week signed to star with ed helms in the duplass brothers' latest movie, "jeff who lives at home."

Male: 76%, Male,  the universe already loves you. love it back by loving yourself and accepting yourself for who you are. may be the 'love it back' is interpreted by the *&^%#@ they' in their own way.!! if we are we always and not harm others....thats life i supose. corectaa? i suffered a lot in my life bcos of those "%&*(& they" and so i stopped worrying about them long time back. sometimes i think what so far i have earned by having a concern for those "naalu peru" ? its bcos of your individuality and courage i admire you always.
Male: 90%, Male, in fact, there was a scene here that reminded me of another good movie - mullholland drive - that bared and flaunted a specific multiple-interpretation scene to needlessly and abruptly drop a hint rather in the middle of the movie. when you use a scene as a hint dropper and not a narrative driver, you give away the ending. (this is the scene where this aspiring actress meets a cowboy in a boxing ring). the movie was significantly less interesting after that point. that scene was disconnected, random and unreal. the entire movie was like that. but that scene was a little bit more of all that than it needed to be.
Male: 100%, Male, since only a few indian universities has met the international standards.its a welcome decission from the govt. as a result our universities will have to face a tough competion for their survival which will raise the quality of our education substantially. and more of our students will get oppurtunity to acquire quality education without the need of going abroad. but few concerns will be since ultimately people in india want quality of education be raised to be more competitive in this world till we are able to stannd on our knees. for that we would like a foregin help but after we stand we should be able to take the charge off. that dosent mean it should be use & throw policy. my suggetions: 1. it shold be a treaty of more than policy or business. 2. it will be better to merge maximum number than letting to open new ones. since education will draw the future india. 
Male: 99%, Female,  there are serials, mindless game shows, cloying "reality" dance shows, movies, movies and more movies. they debuted "adaverallam aada varalaam" recently. the preview shows this guy who injures himself on the dance floor. prithviraj (aka babloo) is begging the show's judges to let him be taken to the hospital. huh?! the injured guy comes up with a really stupid line like, "all warriors want to fall on the battlefield. i'd rather die on stage than go to the hospital." second huh?!!!!!!! okay, drama queen, if you want to die on-stage, that's your problem. but we don't want to see it. of course, its all coached "reality tv" lines. still, who comes up with such crap at sun tv?

Female: 70%, Male, the second installment of stephenie meyer's hugely popular and successful twilight franchise did exactly what it set out to do: capitalize on its pre-existing fanbase and deliver more vampire/human/werewolf romantic intrigue. though it only scored an overall 28% on the tomatometer (compared to the first movie's 50% rating), the twilight saga: new moon was a box office success, making close to $300 million. the story follows the continuing adventures of everygirl bella swan, whose vampire heartthrob edward cullen leaves town in order to keep bella safe from his enemies; 
Female: 100%, Male, my sweeeeeeeeeeeet sister..the lines may seem a bit clichéd to readers, but yes she is one sort of person i wud love to be with at all times ...gone are the days when she asks me to imitate the college profs and crack pjs or rather mokkais and enjoy the scene..i get reminded of all those when i am all alone, dipped in an ocean of solitude missing the dearer ones.... one of the many people whom i miss badly right now......missssssssssssss u a lot........and testimonials written truly with heart, out of affection generally have a bad and an incomplete ending....and i guess this fits well in such a category..........will continue writing further..............

Male: 100%, Male, first of all, the ipl is made for india. it won't work as well anywhere else. india has a billion people who are absolutely cricket-mad. the owners of the franchises are indian and wealthy, the sponsors mainly are indian, there are lots of indian players and it's an indian tv channel that has put its money in. i don't think any other country could do it so well even if it tried. the authorities in england were talking about it a year ago but they can't do it so well. the main thing about the ipl is that it is fun, it is pure entertainment, and it's bollywood - or hollywood, call it what you want. the great thing is that the catchment area for these franchises is so huge that nobody else can compete with that. it will always be better in india.
Female: 93%, Male, he is one of the most interesting ppl in my life...well we met at a tech symposium aarush-srm univ,but it seemed we had been friends for life,he could have been the better judge for the events sparing the srm staff with his impeccable knowledge on a diverse range of topics,and flabbergasted everyone with his tech-trivia! lol .. a prodigy i wud say.....this word sums up this good friend of mine,ten years down the lane,u wud be a gr8 prof (swear my head upon it!),and ur zeal for knowledge will take u to greater zeniths ! all the best dood,i know u are one of the best in my journey ! rock on...

Male: 100%, Male, what is the logic behind bringing hema malini, smriti irani? what is (not are) their contrinution towards developing india? just for the sake of bringing young and women in the party executive body, i think mr. gadkari forgot that when it comes to election this team would not be able to stand and win seats for bjp candidates in front of much more credible names like mr. chidambaram, mr. m. s. ahluwalia, our dear prime minister, mr. rahul gandhi, mr. manu singhavi. mrs. s. gandhi. varun gandhi has already shown that he has no solutions to finght poverty and upbringing the life style of people at least in areas near pilibhit and he is now promoted...good mr gadkari. but as an old rss swayam sevak, who has run shakha for rss in up, i feel cheated and so does the country if bjp is a national party and promisses of a better india. i would have been more happy to see people like modi, raman singh and sivraj singh chauhan, yashvant sinha whom people can trust. even if we want to give you opportunity to run the country in next election, we do not see credible names whom we people of india could trust the way we trust pc, mm. rahul gandhi has not delivered any thing till now but he shows a progressive mind and the way he is taking his career forward gives an impression that he is interested in inclusive growth despite been from the most power full family. while u are selecting people who are good at laughing, dancing, saas-bahu natak.....and no plans for a better india. u have delivered a lot for mumbai and maharashtra, still i can't understand that u chose this team. may be excellence and delivery were not ur primary parameters while selecting ur team and u are also convinced that pc and mm could take better care of the nation and are better people who can take india to the next level. gud luck to u & ur team mr. gadkari. i will be happy to see my self defeated for my feedback and if u win, i will go to sidhivinayak that u could deliver for the country. 
Male: 93%, Male, for the last couple, maybe three weeks i have become crazy watching movies during the weekends. i just turn on the television and start watching the movie that is currently playing, usually its one of the cute ones with steve martin, sanjay dutt, paresh rawal or lindsay lohen.

Male: 100%, Female, this week in home video, we've got a slew of brand new releases coming your way. unfortunately, only a few of them were critical darlings, but the ones that are critic-approved are pretty good ones. among the new releases are the latest in stephenie meyer's twilight series, the most recent offering from disney's traditional animation department, a couple of action flicks that didn't perform as well as they would have liked, a computer animated update of an anime classic, director pedro almodovar's latest film, and a boxset of a brutal south korean trilogy. dig in, and hopefully there'll be something worth your while this week! 
Male: 100%, Male, it’s holi. the festival of colours. the one day politicians can change shades every minute with no questions asked. ominous signs for the bjp – no takers for the saffron dyes. no one was spared. even lk advani was left red-faced at the end of the day. but it had nothing to do with holi. just that all his allies are bailing on him at the last minute. speaking of which, naveen patnaik is facing another flood crisis in orissa. this time around, his office has been inundated with frantic calls from every single prime ministerial candidate in the third front. its ridiculous how everyone in the third front is considering himself / herself pm material. having said that, its good to have choices. last time, we had to pick between an italian and someone who’d never won a lok sabha seat. the scary part? mayawati has thrown her hat in the ring. she is virtually holding the left parties to ransom threatening to leave the front if she is not nominated. am slowly starting to buy into the whole karma philosophy.
Female: 73%, Female, regular readers of this blog, and i am happy to say that it as many as five people, have been pointing out that it has remained unupdated for over two months. a very devoted reader, horror of horrors, even threatened blogultery, if i did not come up with a post soon. i know how hard i have toiled to build readership to such impressive levels and i feel terrified at the prospect of losing it all. i do have a good reason for not blogging. i was away on a holiday for three weeks and while i did contemplate writing about it, i decided against doing so. what, i felt, could i possibly say about london that hasn’t already been said? after all, the very wonderful city attracts an impressive 30 million tourists every year.
Male: 100%, Male, i can't help it. i have a fascination with dogs that are larger than their owners; it makes me laugh every single time. this isn't the best photo that i took yesterday at 89th st and park ave. ... but i think you can see that the lady in the picture can't be much taller than five feet while her pet, standing on its hind legs, would probably be about a foot taller. she could ride him home! jimmy fallon ( who gave me a high five once ) and his family were asked to leave posto pizza (at 18th and 2nd in new york city) after they interpreted a public statement made by fallon as a slight against their establishment -- fallon clarified he likes the pizza, he just felt they did not belong in the competition he was discussing because their crust is super thin as opposed to the others. regardless, he and his family got the boot as the owners laughed and laughed. via jimmy fallon's twitter when i first started writing popular cuture i used to write "top ten lists" of prominent actors' back catalogue of films. i think the first one i wrote was tom cruise -- as kind of a tongue-in-cheek joke i selected one of his more infamous movies as number one. this guy takes that same movie to a whole new level : (psst: i think it's the natural . yes, definitely the natural .) from mouthpiecesports via the will leitch experience i have no idea if he was a comedian, but someone died in new york today. here's the deal: i get terrible reception on my cell phone in my apartment, so, on a day like today when i have an interview to conduct, i venture over to carl schurz park -- which is between the east river and east end avenue around 87th street. while i was there today all hell broke loose. apparently, someone jumped into the river and a large portion of the nypd arrived by land, sea and air. along with the coast guard, fdny and the justice league of america. yes, i watched. did i feel bad? not really. did i feel like i was in the movie stand by me and was about to see ray brower's body? yes. well, they never found the body, he his apparently still floating down the east river somewhere. here are the photos of the action before everyone got bored and went home. hey guys: i will be tweeting my ass off about the snl visit tonight. so, good time as ever to sign up and follow, right? follow mike on twitter two quick points: carter bays, this week, who is one of the creators of how i met your mother , told entertainment weekly that, "at the end of the season, we will address the title of the show." well, then. i'm not sure what to think of this. i'm sure it's just a tease but think of how many shows drop in quality after a revel (which i will go on record saying will not fully happen this season). remember those old burger king ads asking who herb was? the only person who had never tried a whopper. remember when they revealed herb and how successful herb was to the burger king franchise? me either. regardless, is this a good thing? also, i'm not going to mention who, but, a certain snl featured player -- who will forever be known in my apartment as "most awesome person ever" -- invited me to watch this upcoming saturday's show from the writers room. and yeah, tracy morgan is hosting; i'm sure it will be a subdued affair. my god, this may turn out to be the greatest experience of my life. hey, i'll be tweeting that day . (at least a couple, i've been to television tapings before; cell phones are frowned upon.) if you haven't yet: sign up and be one of my six followers ! remember that episode of seinfeld when kramer mistakenly gets called into a business meeting even though he didn't actually work there. i think i may be hoping this somehow happens to me. "hey, we need something right now ... come on, get in here, what are you waiting for?" i don't quite understand it, but yes, i'm now using twitter . perhaps this will be a solution to my lack of original blogging; perhaps not. regardless, if you so choose to follow me , please do at your own risk ... i have no idea what i am doing. 
Female: 100%, Female,  xpu ha don´t worry be happy from david furchtgott on vimeo . as we were driving into our house, i was listening, to the song " don´t worry , be happy ", and, it is unbelievable, to think back, and to see how much we have achieved out of a dream... we started of a tree in xpu ha, just sitting down with a kite waiting for the wind, planning to have a sabatical season... and look where we are now... thank you very much for the support! i´m looking forward to see what is next! keep it real, keep it morph! thank you ben, for taking the time to shoot this pictures and also edit them in your holidays! very nice!, he was taking this pictures side by side with chantelle, he was " embarrased " to give me this pictures, because he says that he can not compete with chantelle´s session, however, i told him, that every photographer has a pint of view, also that he doesn´t have the big monster camera as chantelle does, but his pictures are awesome as well, and every picture is different, every eye is deifferent, so ido appreciate a lot your pics ben! when i took him a picture to post in the blog, he says : don´t take a picture of e i´m going to be horrible in that picture..... i took the picture of him and when he saw it, he told me: you see? just like i told you....horrible!!! jajaja! anyway mon ami, merci beaucoup!!! saludos! este dia nos sopló bastante bien, el viento, estaba más o menos como 15 nudos de dirección noreste, yanick, empezó a armar su eh beast v3, de 6 m2, mientras yo le ayudaba a estirar sus líneas. esto fue en la escuela de kitesurfing de morph en la playa de xpu ha, yanick vino con varios de sus amigos de cancun, pero él fué el único que continuó con su entrenamiento. hoy seguimos con el trainer, y yanick ya tiene muchísimo control con su papalote! ahora ya está dando giros, vueltas, kiteloops! etc, al final de la tarde nos terminamos la arrachera, y fué un buen final de dia en xpu ha... andrés, fué el fotógrafo de éste dia. thank you very much por las fotos amigo! and also thank you for the tacos de carnitas! that was a nice experience! saludos! buenas tardes david, i trust you are well and business is growing! it was great meeting you on the beach in january. i had a lot of fun photographing you kiteboarding and listening to your passionate words about your sport. you're setting a powerful example. i would have liked to have accepted your invitation for lessons before leaving on our journey to weave together the prophecies of the maya and inka at the sacred sites of tulum, coba, chichen itza, and ek balam. i didn't have the space to stop by this time and will build room into my schedule when i return. it was pretty different, almost difficult, coming back to sweden with a temperature of -20 c compared to the +28 c in tulum. three journeys to tulum in the last 15 months and looking forward to returning as soon as possible. you have a beautiful country and the land speaks to me. it would be cool to meet up with some kiteboarding folks here in stockholm. i appreciate any connections you may have. thank you. as agreed david, here are some of the photos that i took that afternoon. they are small at 72dpi to keep the email size low. left me know if you would like any in a larger size. i join ed morph kiteboarding group on fb when i saw it the other day. warm regards, scott as i´m coming out of the xpu ha palapa, i see francoise, writting something, as i approach i can spy that he is studying the wind window! good for you man! i love to see people thirsty for knowledge! i actually don´t even think he knows i took his picture.. saludos ! nokia morph concept from ozan basar on vimeo . read more about... cia cucoritza! thank you zoltán for this amazing set! 
Male: 100%, Male, hey finally puredistortion has moved to its very own site. it is at www.puredistortion.com. this blog will stay up and have all of the archived posts here from before the move. they will be avaliable at puredistortion.blogger.com and blog.puredistortion.com dale finally the local game store is getting into the wizards of the coast game magic the gathering and stocking some of the cards. for me this is really cool as this is a game that i have always been interested in but no one in my social circles played at all. also i think it is a game that my wife could really get into as well which would be cool as the continual smackdown i get in card games like uno, skipbo and phase10 are beginning to wear a bit thin lol. so with this motivation i have been looking into how the game works as i have only ever had a couple of goes at the game in shops as demos and came a cross a series of online videos done by wizards that are really great at explaining the game and how it works. i ahve only supplied links or else this post would be massive lol. this is a 6 part series that is titled "learn to play magic the gathering": (links to each video are the part 1 ect links) part 1: is an introduction to magic and the decks and how to get started. part 2: is an explanation on the cards them selves. part 3: is about the different types of cards that will be in your deck. part 4: is all about the turn sequence and a basic turn. part 5: is all about attacking and blocking. part 6: deck building and the stratergies. another thing that the guys at wizards do is they supply the rules online so that you can get down to your hobby store get a starter deck and get straight into playing you can get a copy of the rules straight from the website there are also link to other helpful playing resources such as the gatherer . the gatherer is an online database of all of the cards available so you can study up on you opponent or hunt out your next rare purchase/trade. also check out www.magicthegathering.com there is heaps of stuff on there. on dakka dakka today found a link to a site called armyroster.com . army roster is a web based army builder that is now looking for people for beta accounts to test the site and provide feedback and bugs. i creatd an account on the site and went through and started to build a 1500pt list for my orc and goblin fantasy army (at the moment warhammer fantasy lists are all that can be created) and found the interface nice and simple to use, though it did not have the ajax web2.0 feel that i had come to expect from web applications these days. now apart from the feel there were a few more things that annoyed me, the basic functionality was not complete yes so links that were in the site would go to error pages and also the lists for the fantasy armies were incomplete with me not being able to add in things that are in the army book. also the need for the site to be all linked in as a community was also something that annoyed me (fro no real reason) and this is something that i have issues with more and more new generation web apps providing a service have to try and shoe horn in community tools like forums into the site when forums already exist for the subculture that they are aiming at, i believe that these developers hould focus more on building intergration with existing services. though i must say when the opponent finder... one of the broken bits of the site... is working i think this will be a great way for people to find other people in the local area to find opponents. now with those points aside this site has real potential to be a real competitor to army builder especially if they build on a few little bits of functionality. for example the site already validates your core choice requirements and total points but not charater magic items. the ability for people to be able to view your avaliable armies via a url so that you can link to your profile in a forum. also the ability to import your own army spec files for games that army roster does not currently supprt would also be an awesome idea and take some load off the developers doing data entry for every game that they wish to support. though overall i think when this app gets out of beta... and i am griping about a site that is in very early beta at the moment... it will be an awesome site that will be a serious alternative to army builder and free. so check out armyroster.com and keep an eye on it as when it is up and running i think it will be a great web app. i know i will be using it. found an interesting solution for users of plesk/qmail for how to identify a user who is abusing your authenticated smtp service. running the command: cat /var/log/messages | grep -i smtp_auth | grep "logged in" | awk {' print $11 '} | awk -f / {' print $6"@"$5 '} | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail or: cat /var/log/syslog | grep -i smtp_auth | grep "logged in" | awk {' print $11 '} | awk -f / {' print $6"@"$5 '} | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail depending on your linux distro and you will get an output like the example bellow: 7 user@example.com 7 someone@spmewhere.net.au 8 stuff@onthenet.com.au 8919 user@crackeddomain.com.au as you can see the account 'user' for the domain 'crackeddomain.com.au' are having unusually high amounts of smtp connections for an account. this is useful for tracking bulk email being sent through your system or hijacked accounts being used by spammers. i found this on rackerhacker.com a site by seinior rackspace systems engineer major hayden, go and check it out it is full of awesome content. with all of the talk going on on the net and in main stream media about the new "great firewall of australia" isp spam filter i though i should have my say. firstly i think that this is ridiculous especially when the report that has been released regarding there 30 user test in tasmania.... 30 user how the hell does 30 users represent australia's traffic, maybe that is the amount of users that dont download mp3's or movies, but it is not a decent representation of the traffic this country generates. also the reports suggest that internet link costs will go up due to the cost of implementation and the speed of the link will be slower. apart from this just making no sence at all why should someone decide for me what is relevant for me to view on the net (now mr conroy i am not a pedophile or a terroist) as filters miss one big factor..... context. how can a filter that only sees a request to a server on port 80 judge if i am looking at a site of "potentially" harmful information such as euthinasia to kill my self or i am writing a ballanced document about both sides of the topic.. in shor it can't and if some one is looking in this example for a way to kill themselves they will find it one way or another you aren't going to stop them. also with the filtering being done at the isp level what is going to stop the isp tracking your data and selling it to marketing firms in some way or another and this dosent have to be a company as a whole, it could be just an enterprising engineer working in the back end. this senario gets even worse when some if the technologies have the ability to decrypt and inspect ssl traffic the same traffic that used by internet banking and sites online.. can you say the death of online shopping in australia. another thing to consider is not only will we be told what not to view but these decisions will cause false positive removing "legitimate" that we should be entitled to see. also what stops the logical progression of an anoymous filtering tool becoming a tracking tool so it is logged where your ip has been or that a government would use the filter to block content that is contrary to there views and opinions. it is all possible just look to the harsh filtering of there internet users by there government. finially with this solution costing millions and millions and can be simpily avoided by using one of the many tools avaliable today. proxies, tor, vpn, web anonimisers all have the ability to bypass this technology so people who are looking at this dodgy content still will be able to as isp's will not be able to block these technologies as that would serverly hamper australian businesses. in the end if it does come in to australia i will be starting a buisnes soffering vpn solutio, help stop one of the greatest free speah injustices in this lifetime.ns to a data centre in another country to make some cash of all of the dodgy and paranoid people out there. in the end they cant stop what you look at on the net just hamper the growth of the technology sectors of australia. they would be better spending this money on stopping people in this country creating the content. please sign the

certin computer systems. there have been minimal details on the intrusion and what actually has happened as investigations are still happening. redhat's first concern was the redhat network (rhn) and ensuring that their distrobution channel with there clients was intact. i think this is a great move by redhat acting so swiftly and ensuring that the packages that were in there up2date/yum channels were secure. what was detected was a number ro ssh service (here is a link to info on ssh) packages were signed and released to channels. in a move to quickly rmove this threat from the channel and customers systems that may have already down loaded and installed the rpm's is to relaease new rpm's into the channels for the affected systems. this is another move that i think is a great move by redhat as it quickly and elegantly removes these unauthorised packages quickliy from rhel systems and the update channels, using this method also means that mant people will go without even having the packages installed on there system as rpm (redhat's package management system) uses versions to controll what packages it downloads and will always download the newr version if it avaliable. the affected versions of redhat enterprise linux are red hat enterprise linux 4, red hat enterprise linux 5, and red hat enterprise linux 4.5 extended update support. as well as theis there has been a script released by redhat that will assess weather you system has installed the affected packages and is avaliable from the redhat website (see link at end of post). i think that this issue has been handled well by redhat and has showed how simply issues like this can be managed with a solid package management solution such as rpm. it will be interesting to see how this progresses and i will keep an eye on this and keep you updated as news gets out about new updates on the issue. link to redhat security advisory link to openssh-blacklist script while trawling through the www.wargamerau.com forums today i came across 2 new things that make the future release of thq's dawn of war series looking like something to keep an eye out for. the first is the new trailer that was released yesterday titled 'this world is not ours'. it is amazing and the animators at thq have done a great job capturing the warhammer 40k universe. not only that this trailer is that good it points that games workshop really needs to consider making a full cg movie based on the 40k world. though enough ranting check it out: though this is only the start, not only are thq pumping out awesome cut scene trailers, but they are also in the process of having a british army fv432 apc cut, chopped and rebuilt into a space marine rhino... i know how cool is that. the tqh rhino build diary announces 'the completed rhino will be making its public début at games workshop games day 2008 at the birmingham nec on 14th september. click here for more information or to book tickets for the event.' unfortunately the rhino wont be filled with space marines but with high end gaming machines that i am assuming that you will be able to have a crack at dow2 if you are able to get close enough. check out the rhino diary article @ thq here and the flikr diary of photos of the build here. also keep an eye here at pd as being both a warhammer and car fan, i will be following the build as it goes on. so if you are going to this event please get in contact with me so that we can get some pics up of the completed rhino sitting at games day. 
Male: 100%, Male, we're working in the studio now. i'll be posting pictures. check this space... we boarded the laurence m. gould for our journey back on december 23, 2006. going back through the gerlache passage was even more exciting and beautiful than coming the other way. if you look back towards the beginning of the blog, you can see the brilliant day that greeted us in antarctica. on the way back the day was overcast, with mysterious lines of clouds clinging to the mountains on either side of the passage. i couldn't put down the camera , or if i did, it was to pick up the video camera. i could barely grab a sandwich! as the ship turned away, palmer station seemed to fade into the distance. but no sooner was it gone when suddenly the scenery was utterly compelling. we saw whales numerous times, although none with the canon digital. this combination of granite and fog, ice and water was more mysterious than any landscape i had ever seen. only the photos of wang wusheng come even close. usually it didn't look sinister but that first picture reminds me of the pilots i have known who joke about granite clouds. the changes happened fast. focusing on one point sometimes yielded several different photos, both because of the motion of the ship and also the movement of the clouds. the scale of the mountains is not terribly evident in these small photos. but i estimate the cliffs as 30 to 75 meters high. late in the day we passed smith island. antarctica was retreating in the distance. the low angle of sun had us seeing night for the first time in nearly two months. i wondered how i would react, but i slept so soundly, it was a relief. we had an almost endless sunset that went on for hours. here is mate, larry brissette at the controls. since there were only five passengers on board, the crew invited us to be in the bridge. art and i took them up on their offer and spent a good deal of time talking and watching the navigation process as we crossed the drake. it was so smooth that they were calling it drake's lake! lucky, because we had talked to passengers on a cruise ship that moored at palmer and they had encountered 10 to 15 meter waves. a part of me would have liked to experience something like that, but the prospect of being tied to my bed for three days was not too appealing. this is how we celebrated christmas day. captain scott flanagan gave us a "safety demo" by shooting of flares and letting us shoot some off the stern of the ship. this is the chart and log as we approached cape horn. we continued up the atlantic coast of tierra del fueg o, argentina, to the mouth of the straight of magellan. once inside the straight, we met the pilot who guided us into port at punta arenas. somewhere in the drake passage i snapped this picture of the ship board computer screen. it was christmas day, day 359 of the year, 17:04 gmt. our position was at 55+ degrees south latitude, 64º west longitude. we were headed almost due north 345º with a bearing of 348º, making 11.5 knots of headway. the wind was coming from the due north at 25 or 22 knots (different gauges). our heading is toward isla estados . the salinity of the water was 33.7 (not sure the units), water temperature was 5.362ºc (up at least 5º from our departure at palmer.) depth is 3953 meters (more than 10,000 feet!) air temp is 10.2ºc. relative humidity 76%. wind chill -1.1ºc. barometric pressure measured 983.5 millibars. here is punta arenas on our arrival. i was overwhelmed by the color. just seeing green trees was an intense experience. i like punta arenas. it is a stopping over point for many outdoor treks and the town is full of camping stores like north face and patagonia. (this is patagonia , after, all.) maybe someday i'll come back and explore south america from here. i have a lot to say about antarctica, what i saw, what i learned. i'll be posting form time to time about the progress on my work in the studio. i hope to display the cast glass along with the photography and video and perhaps some cast ice, as well. i'm just looking for the right venue. i'd still like to post my thoughts on the vast visual input of my ice studies. another might tackle the implications of global climate change and the vast re-ordering of the earth which is happening under our feet. i'd like to especially than the national science foundation for making this magical voyage possible, along with their contractor for antarctica, raytheon polar services. everybody was wonderful and more than helpful. i saw more, accomplished more than i ever could have imagined. some of your comments that were posted also deserve a response. i didn't take full advantage of the blog format, but what a blast this has been! go blogger! if you wish to contact me, please write druth@glass.com . i'll try to answer all questions. on the last full day we were at palmer station, i wanted to go out in the zodiac one last time. art demurred. i think he was looking forward to getting on the gould and heading home. i wanted to see the one part of the glacier face that we had not been able to see from the zodiacs. curt smith was eager to go. our technology wizard, he ran the computer network and knew about all the electronics. this channel was created by a collapse of the glacier in 2003 that cut off old palmer from the main part of anvers island. the channel itself was too narrow to allow boating, because of its nearness to the calving glacier face. but by climbing over old palmer we were able to get close and see the new ice. it was worth it because the whole scene was so fresh and pure. plus it connected the parts we had seen from the boat. the famous skua. not sure if this is a south polar skua or a brown skua. they are slightly obnoxious birds that are like giant seagulls. the eat penguin eggs and chicks, and are scavengers. not too popular among the happy feet crowd, but hey, a bird's gotta eat! they were very protective of their own nests. art got a picture of one coming at him dead on, also on old palmer. we heard they like to kick as they go by so he ducked, but got the photo anyway. we jumped over a lot of rocks. its amazing how much of a rubble pile is left in the wake of glacier retreat. my feet, ankles and knees hurt for weeks! we were hoping to take one more look at the ice arch. but a colony of elephant seals had gathered in front of our access. these two young males were wrestling right in our path. we went around them. the gould had pulled in a day earlier, loading freight from palmer. it was there to take us home. a bittersweet ending. we deleted ourselves from the computer systems, the lab and our dorm room. all of our stuff was packed and ready to ship. by time i took this picture, they had already loaded our freezer container that had been on the edge of the dock. that night we stayed on the gould in preparation for leaving the next morning. dear friends, i`m travelling in chile, on the slow route home. i have many great photos yet to post so watch this space sometime after january 5th, 2007. art and i took many photos in the gerlache and neumayer passages. the day was quite different from the brilliant, cloudless day when we arrived. this one was misty and dramatic. i´ll get to it soon. david we are leaving palmer station today, saturday, december 23, for our four day boat ride on the laurence m. gould back to punta arenas, chile. a bittersweet ending, leaving this beautiful place. however, i got what i came for, which was information on how the ice looks. i feel that with the molds and so many photographs i have learned so much. now i can go home, digest, and start to make my cast glass sculpture. i expect to add a few postings to this blog as i dig out photos and clean them up with photoshop. (not to enchance them, so much as to make them more realistic than what the electronic camera thought it saw.) hang on for a few weeks until i get home. thank you, everybody, for your support and comments. this has been so fun and i feel invigorated by all your compliments and questions. please email me at druth@glass.com david ruth on old palmer, which is now an island, due to the retreat of the glacier, and the former site of palmer station, there is both an ice arch and also an ice cave. we posted pictures of the ice arch before. this time we couldn't get to it because the elephant seals had taken it over. fifteen or more had come inside, and a few were in the cave itself. a few weeks ago, jeff found the entrance to the ice cave under the snow and dug it out. i had seen pictures and was eager to get back to old palmer but circumstances delayed us for a while. the entrance is small and we had to crawl in. you couldn't stand up, but what a scene. the whole thing is glowing blue green ice, floor ceiling and walls. it has indented arches forming a long tunnel, maybe 20 or 24 meters. the floor was lightly frozen over some water, which i found when i sat down. christina is the person in charge of all the long running experiments, mostly in terra lab. she has been doing time-lapse studies of the environment. last one was of the gould leaving, in several thousand pictures. i suggested a picture of my ice sculpture melting and evaporating. in a land without green plants the rocks become stark, the lichens vivid. especially as the snow melts off the glacier rubble, it exposes beauty in the patterns of lichens, moss and the rocks themselves. i have been in love with rocks for years, but here they are so prominent. in my proposal to the nsf i requested that i be allowed to cast the local rock if i decided that the it was more interesting than the ice. in the end, although i love the ice, the variety of textures is not all that great. after ten molds we had most of them. i asked and was granted persmission to spread the silicone mold material on sea-washed rocks next to the station. the resulting rubber mold is spectacular, although i didn't get to see it for long as it was snatched away to send home. art has the incriminating photo of me spreading the raw goop on the rocks. i felt kind of bad doing it, even with permission since this environment is so pristine, the international park, as it were. but the silicone performed like a champ and completely peeled off the rock without a trace. i spent a few minutes picking up the few pieces, but there is no remaining evidence that anyting happened there, to my relief. i had visions of spending the last two days of my stay at palmer station rubbing moling compound off the rocks. fortunately that was not the case. no post of mine from antarctica would be complete without pictures of ice. we got the boat out and found some gorgeous pieces in arthur harbor. this piece was clear ice, but even underwater, you can see the facets, veils and bubbles. one last blue ice glacier bit. two minutes of glorious sunset on the night before solstice at midnight. orange light on the blue ice. i figured out how to save the glacier! i'm going to turn it into glass. i actually managed to make a small glass sculpture in the palmer station lab using exactly the process i had proposed with the ice molds. over the past few weeks, art and i have taken several silicone molds off of ice surfaces from pieces we have found in the water around the station. i melted some paraffin wax into different silicone textures and built up a small wax model for the glass using three textures from the ice. after embedding the wax in a dental casting plaster, i melted out the wax in a small lab bench furnace at about 200ºc. here is my studio on the mash and grind deck of palmer bio building. we put the kiln go outside so as not to smoke everyone our during the burnout process. i was worried that the weather might affect the firing temperature, but it didn't. here is the mold with chunks of glass i had brought from oakland, melting at nearly 800ºc. the glass is a very light copper/cobalt blue, with about a thousandth percent colorant, very light. ken setting the temperature on the controller. this controller was not ideal since it wouldn't turn down slower than 1ºc per minute. i wanted the high temperature cooling to be less than half that so i babied it for several hours while it went through that critical phase. here is the piece when i broke it out of the mold. notice the two textures. one was the smooth faceted ice and the other side was the snowy, granular ice. the "nose" is a third slightly wrinkly texture. zenobia and kerry organized an art show in the bar at palmer. i put in some of my ice pieces, including this tall one i have shown before in "ice studies." the top photo is after an hour out of the freezer container. the second, several hours later as the sun was setting. the ice broke up internally around the crystals, which had also formed the facets. the afternoon was warm enough so the ice started to melt. it lasted just about exactly 24 hours before it tumbled to the deck. i also put in one of the silicone molds. i wonder if anybody got it, but it represented an absence of form, absence of a sculpture, maybe the absence of the glacier. several guys were fascinated by the silicone, since it's flexible and strong. above is another picture of my glass casting taken in the declining light of the day at about 11pm. below is another of our "ice studies," when we were in the container with the photo lights. this one used one blue light to accentuate the clear form. 
Male: 100%, Male,  my first impression of front row was so positive - this crazy mac thing has a remote control, and you can use it to browse your media stuff. that's awesome, i love it! but then i ran into difficulties - i had trouble importing files into itunes. i imported iron & wine like 5 times before i figured it out - the files had damaged tags, so itunes (apple's media management software) couldn't recognize them. ok, that's a pain. i stuck into a windows program, rewrote the tags, and then it worked. and then i decided i wanted to watch movies over the network. this turned out to be a challenge. the answer was to connect to the network share, and to drop a symbolic link to the mac filesystem into the "movies" folder, so that i could make front row browse to that share. but then the first time that the mac slept, it severed the connection to the remote volume. after lots of research, i've found no simple solution. apparently you can write a script to automatically mount a volume when the computer wakes from sleep, and there may be pay software out there, but no thanks on both counts. my solution so far - since i was moving my media to external hard drives anyway, i just plug that sucker into the mac. no problem. so i run front row, browse to movies movies volumes mybook tv ds9 and i can watch all the rene auberjonois i want. it works, though i wouldn't say it "just" works. of course, i have another hard drive in the living room, connected to the nice stereo, and that drive has all my music. i can't listen to any of it through front row. because that music isn't in the itunes database, it doesn't exist as far as front row is concerned. and i'm not about to let itunes get its hands on that folder. i don't want to force all my computers to use itunes. i don't even know how i'd go about dealing with the fact that i have one archive of the music which must be accessible to several computers. it's a solution that just doesn't work for me. maybe it's years of windows use, but i am very much accustomed to the model that my computer files are organized by a filesystem hierarchy, and programs must access that hierarchy to work. i hate synching, and the attendant requirement that i lose control over my filesystems and access to those filesystems. that's why my mp3 player is now just my blackberry curve. i plug it into my computer, browse the filesystem, see what's there. i can drag a new folder into it at any time and delete folders at will. i don't have to run any program other than explorer to do this. i don't need any special cables to charge it, either, because i just plug it into a usb port. it's such a simple solution. i love it to death. i'm sure itunes could do something similar if i were using an ipod, but i'd have to add the music to the itunes database and then figure out how to put a selection of music on the ipod. and that's assuming i didn't run into any iron & wine-style problems. and i'm thinking about all this because of that badly-named ipad. i'm sure some people will like it, but i don't get it. i feel like you're paying a premium for a crippled computer. like the iphone, it's designed to lock you into using apple products and apple stores to get all your content, and i don't want that. for less than half the price of the ipad, i could have a netbook that would offer a real keyboard, the ability to run a much larger selection of applications, similar battery life, similar or better portability (having seen how many broken iphone screens there are out there, i wonder how that big glass is going to fare), and a higher-resolution display. mostly, it looks like a media player to me, and it lacks an hd display. it's a big glass box that you throw in your backpack and sometimes you surf the web on it. and maybe it's goofy to turn a netbook on its side to read comics, but i've done it and it works really, really well. but the best part is that i don't have to pay one company every time i want to do something on my netbook. i bought the damn computer, and it will do what i want it to with the music and movies that i already have. also, my netbook cost me less than half what the ipad will cost. i don't get it. i love this badly drawn boy song - the chorus starts "soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me". perfect for these grey days. another favorite "sun" song of mine is david bowie's memory of a free festival, here presented in appropriately "ragged and naive" cover form by a band of british optometry students: as the students explain in the video, the band makes heavy use of an institutional vcs3 synthesizer, made by ems. ems, oddly enough, advertised its synthesizers with nun imagery . the synthesizers sound - thick and analog - used on early doctor who. the effect - satori must be something quite the same. plus blocked fire hydrant plus fire truck equals hypocrisy comedy gold . a metafilter thread about a video mocking the dark knight's plot holes yields this interesting comment by user rokusan: [...] the screenplay had a lot of buzz [....] because the structure was unexpectedly tight (despite the running time) and it was even darker than expected. i do remember, too, that it was presented to me as "it's about relentlessness." [....] the war on terror buzz was because at the time, it was seen in some circles as unusually brave/crazy to attack or mock the usa's illegal surveillance apparatus: the movie shoved the wrongness of it at the audience by having one of america's most trusted voices™ tell us how wrong it was. big budget hollywood hadn't taken an anti-government stance much in recent times. this was unusual, and i think a lot of folks anticipating a "comic book" story didn't expect it. [....] i continue to be really surprised at the love for this movie (currently #9 on imdb's top 250). i am doubly surprised at the excitement over the tightness of the thing - i thought it made no sense at all, like it's plot went through the blender. scenes just come and go. most famously - what happened at the end of the joker's home invasion? the scene ends with no resolution. i like heath ledger in tdk, but that's about it. good metafilter discussion about whether you should default on your home loan when the value of the home is way below the mortgage amount. homes are immensely personal, and the discussion highlights the extent to which personal fondness for homes and senses of morality unite to cause people to make irrational decisions about their houses. there's a sad tale in there of a guy whose dad refused to go into bankruptcy out of a sense of honor, and the negative impact it had on his family. 
Male: 100%, Male, sorry, kiddos, but this blog has gone the way of the dodo. we've moved the blog over to our home site at comicfoundry.com . so click over, continue reading and update your rss feeds. cya there hey all! changes are a coming for this site. namely that it will be defunct quite shortly as we've relaunched comicfoundry.com . say goodbye to the users and portfolios — as much i loved having them as part of the original site it's not really what comic foundry is about any more. so say hello to a streamlined site with our integrated blog, story archive and issue excerpts. you can also now buy issues of the magazine and subscriptions through the site! so head on over to the new site , update your links and update your rss feeds. see you there! (from a story on diy costumes in the october issue of complex) you're all probably excited about seeing battlestar galactica: razor, right? i can't wait to see a tv movie about the pegasus crew that debuts on nov. 24th. really, i can't wait. that's why i was so glad that registration on this site just opened for advance screenings in select cities on nov. 12th! the lucky cities include: • boston • chicago • dallas/ ft. worth • los angeles • new york city • philadelphia • san francisco • seattle hurry and register before they're out of fraking seats. mark millar just posted that he got turned down for writing the superman movie sequel because he was too associated with marvel: well, sadly, i'm a marvel guy and we were surprised to find out that wb couldn't hire me for a dc property. they were incredibly nice and superbly apologetic about it, but when they discussed the matter seriously dc explained just how associated i am with marvel comics at the moment and it's against company policy to hire the competition. it's absolutely nothing personal. i spoke to some friends at dc and they explained this has happened with a couple of big marvel writers in the last couple of years and i absolutely respect that. my question is: how is that different when super-dc guy geoff johns wrote and produced for the blade tv series (a marvel property)? a great 300 parody, courtesy of robot chicken the trailer to vertigo's series of online comics that serve as a prequel to the december film i am legend is up and in hd . the first online issue, by steve niles and bill sienkiewicz, is available here . personally, i'm not a big fan of flat art that's later animated, but i'm not going to poo poo any attempt of comics moving ahead with more progressive media ideas. paul pope with act-i-vater jeff newelt click for the whole flickr set (by mg soulcraft) 
Female: 100%, Female,  post note: little bunny died about three hours after i brought him in house. i'm sure the stress was just too much for him. he seemed to be picking up some speed at one point. it is all for the better. he was warm and cared for. i found a wounded bunny near a hay pile i was moving by the lamb stalls this morning. he had tucked himself into the safest spot he could, and squeaked when i was near by. his hind leg has a puncture wound, through to the bone. he's alive, but i've had my dr. quinn episodes with bunnies, wildlife doesn't fare well with human interference even when well intended. i imagine a cat got him. i iodined it after saline bath. he is more alert than when i found him, and i have him at my desk safe from puppies and wandering felines. not sure if he will make it. he'll die attended though, although the sounds of the dogs playing is probably not helping. he is calm when held. the wandering array of life continues, as does pending death. these little episodes are not meant to distress, but to remind us of the bigger picture. life is temporary, and can be snapped away in a bite by man or beast. the conflict of having compassion for but raising livestock to sustain me, the conflict of helping a bunny that eats my food...intertwined. lilly had her lambs last night. she finally started labor around six p.m. and we came to the barn a few times to find her still in pre labor. this early morning we arrived to find lambs, two beauties. the male is very large, and already eating a little grass this usually doesn't happen for a few days or more.] the girl is this wonderful strawberry blonde. sadly, on my second trip to the barn, she had torn her eyelid on a piece of the lambing pen - i treated with saline and antibiotic and think it will heal fine. lilly is one of our work horse sheep - always calm, and stoic. she's a big girl who throws strong lambs. i was concerned she had held out this long, as we never have lambs past 3/12...and of course my over active imagination drummed up all sorts of possibilities. i tortured myself by re-reading my sheep books about possible causes, and lay in bed last night with visions of lilly lying in breach birth trauma...but i guess mlle. nature just wasn't ready to pop those two out, and they arrived very mature - with ears already standing by morning. normally i wait at least one day to put mom and lambs out, but it's sunny and warm, and lilly is an old pro. it's less stressful than being separated from the flock. they develop so much faster - i find - when they can go outside. i want to thank all the nice thoughts people held for us this season- i have to say, i feel like a boulder has been lifted off my chest. the trauma of last year really made a mark on me, and martyn, and it showed this season. we lost the stillborn girl, and i still fret about the surviving twin's rattle, but all in all, we are pleased. and relieved. as the last ewe to lamb, lilly rests, and waits. and one of audrey's boys catches some sunny zzzzz's. on what most likely was a chilly march 10th in 1958, in a hospital room at st. mary's in rochester, minnesota, i came bolting into the world at precisely 10:18 pm. and so begins the story which over the years has reached mythical proportions- how i almost killed my mother on my birthday. perhaps it is one reason i chose to never have children - my own mother terrified the heck out of me with my own birth story. in all seriousness, my mother did almost bleed to death, and i have this scar she likes to point out on my forehead from the momentous occasion. supposedly my father looked pale and upset when he saw me because i was pink and red and lobster like, where as my brother came out a year earlier looking like jfk - seriously, for years my mother compared my brother's looks to jfk. i was compared to a lobster. and hours before i barged out of the womb, my father had been called to the morgue, where his 57 year old mother lay dead, of a heart attack, diabetes related. her untimely death led me to receive her name, katherine, instead of bridgette which my mother had picked out. i cant imagine being named bridgette, although as a child i liked to tell this story, since bridgette bardot was all the rage, and as a chubby little redhead, i thought bb was quite the cat's pajamas. so i can only imagine the yin and yang and surreal quality of that cold march night for my father. i wonder if there were things that brought it all back to him as he aged. did the sound of heels on a linoleum floor late at night bring back a sensation of the events he dealt with that night? as i get older, 52 years older to be exact, i can understand how this moment is burned into my mother, or father, in some kind of post traumatic stress way. but being true minnesotans, we carried on, and every year, my mother made me one of my favorite layer cakes- at the time it was white cake with pink butter frosting. in time, my tastes changed to german chocolate, or her white cake with chocolate frosting. i still have the same recipe cards she hand wrote so many years ago, all spotted with vanilla stains. while i appreciate that i was born, i am not one of the people out there saying that birth is beautiful. in fact, i couldn't disagree more. it's an intimate moment of a mother creature being out of control of her body. miraculous, yes, but not beautiful. i get just about as much birth as i need on the farm, thank you very much , and all the blood, after birth and vaginal prolapses that come with it. i think birth is traumatic, terrifying, bloody and completely chaotic. it's a mess. in fact, it makes no sense. a creature pushed out of a keyhole - that's not beautiful, it's bizarre. it's a miracle, but it's not beautiful. but it's the only way to get a foot in the door, isn't it? staying in a womb all your life would be safe, and warm, and inexpensive - no taxes, no maniacs on the radio shouting at you. but there would be no grand entrance, no kisses, no pie made with the first strawberries, no front row seats to neil young. no puppies. no showers on a hot day. no hand to hold when a father dies and no little mouths to feed when a mother dies. no matter what creatures come into your life, mothering is the beautiful part of birth. that some one would go through that trauma to give another creature a way to get their foot in the door of this big, messy place called life. the winds have come in, it's bone chilling. all day i was carried back to a place i liked to hide when i was little, a grove of sumac bushes out behind our house. alone, i felt protected, but spooked at the same time. rushing back to the house, i'd hear the wind blowing buckets and roof tops, and it felt scary like the wizard of oz. but home was warm, there was homemade cake even on my non birthday. it wasn't messy. it's like that today - the sounds of the barn roof rattling in the wind are spooky, but i feel safe in the barn, surrounded by my mothering ewes. together with my flock, i experienced the trauma of last year's lambing, and just like my mother did after my birth, i carry that trauma with me in a little surface wound, in danger of getting reopened if i bump it just right. i realized it's my very own birth story, and it's required if one expects to find a sense of place in this messy world. march 10, post note: daisy presented my with two healthy lambs this morning, a perfect way to start my birthday. they've made it 8 hours...we'll hope they do well tonight. they appear okay. i saw some tail wiggling while at the udder [ asign they are getting milk]. when i saw these pictures, i was quite amused at their expressions. amazing how they adapt. we are grateful for the sun and warmer weather, to help our lambing week along. these are fern's lambs, now one week old. we had hoped more of the girls would lamb this weekend - perfect weather. i knew everyone of the 5 ewes was ready to pop, but i like to keep them up and atom until they really go down into labor. the new mothers can surprise you though - i once had a new mom waddling casually back to the barn with her baby half way out. so last night i was pretty sure nelly moser would lamb. and she did. i have been somewhat concerned about what type of mother nelly would be- of all our sheep she is somewhat flighty. arriving at the barn, there she was with two fresh lambs, probably born around 8 am. but she wasn't caring to them very proficiently- she wasn't licking them or chortling much. one was quite dopey looking and chilled, not a good sign. i checked her udder and she had milk, and both ram lambs did suck on my finger, another good sign. i opted not to tube them [a procedure where you insert a stomach tube and force feed], and gave him milk from my finger instead. i decided to take them outside since it is sunny and much warmer outside than the cool barn. nelly was just a bit clueless, but she's adapting. she is chortling more, and can get them to the udder, but she's not as good as the pros at helping them 'get it". she did not dry them off well either, and i had to step in and help. within a half hour, i had them warmed up, thanks to the towel and the sun. we will just have to watch them and see. in the last 3 hours, i think both mother and lambs are adjusting to the newness of everything. and the other girls wait...here's lilly, who i'm sure will go soon. in fact, they are all showing signs of pending labor. the rules of this game are simple: wait...watch...then run with all your heart to where ever the guy in front of you runs. 
Female: 100%, Female, great track workout! 3/4 mile slow jog, a bunch of drills (high knees, lunges, killer long jump things, etc.) then we did a mile on the track, sprinting on the straight parts &amp; walking on the curves. invigorating! then a 1/4 mile cool down jog. then one of the other girls and i did a mile jog--really nice way to wrap up an early morning workout! (kind of stinks that w/the time change, the whole 5:45-6:45 workout was in the dark.) it still amazes me that, at the end of the workout, i can do a mile slow jog and talk the whole way through. i mean, my heart rate is still going up, and my lungs get a workout, but it's pretty easy. that's just crazy. and awesome. total was 3 miles plus the drills. we were out there about an hour. 3.27 miles, 36 minutes, 11:00 pace. okay, it wasn't a good pace, but boy was it a great run. i focused on going slow, and was able to think more about lengthening my stride. i added a little speed at the end, but if i hadn't done that, i felt like i could have run for at least 10 more minutes. maybe my easiest run ever. but still a good workout. i'm liking this slow jogging thing. :) wow! not the greatest energy today, but a great run! this is the furthest i've ever run, but just a bit (both time & distance.) i'm pleased that i focused on conserving my energy but was still a little faster than thursday (even though speed isn't the goal right now.) next week when i add 4 more minutes to my run i should be up over 3.5 miles. :) 3.39 miles, 36 minutes, 10:37/mile 3.03 miles in 33 minutes (10:52 per mile.) for my 10k training i'm focusing on slowing my pace so that i can run a bit longer each week and build up my endurance! this felt like a great, fairly easy pace for me. i was able to speed up just a bit in the last half mile, and i sprinted for the last 45 seconds. knowing i had that extra energy at the end, i know i could have gone further. 6.2 miles seems a lot more attainable when i'm not pushing my speed! the trainer doing our tuesday track sessions gave me advice on how to train for my april 4 10k. here's the plan: week 1 (this week): track training 33 minute run 2-36 minute runs week 2: track training 36 minute run 2-40 minute runs week 3: track training 40 minute run 2-44 minute runs week 4: track training 44 minute run 2-48 to 49 minute runs so the idea is to increase my distance by 10% per week, and to run the whole way, no matter how slow i need to go. that way i've got the endurance to run most and maybe even all of the 10k. running the whole way would be amazing but i'm not putting too much pressure on myself. that would be about 20 minutes longer than my longest training run. we'll see how much energy, motivation, and adrenaline i have on race day! right now i think a reasonable goal for the 10k is 68:12 or less. that's an average of 11 minutes or less per mile. as i get closer, i'll reevaluate to determine if that still seems like a good goal or not. i'm starting weekly group track workouts with a trainer to help my running. today we did a slow warm-up jog (3/4 mile), then did a timed mile. one mile time was 8:58! personal best! i am thrilled to have run a mile in under 9 minutes! this was my first official 5k! my pace was just a smidge slower than last time i ran in my neighborhood. i think with the excitement i got off on my breathing, and i did a little bit of walking near the end because of some side cramps and just being winded. but it went great, and i can't wait to beat this time next time i do a race! out of 181 women, i was #91, which puts me precisely in the middle of the pack. i'm pretty happy with that, with under 4 1/2 months of running under my belt honestly, i was hoping to have my personal best time/pace, but it was still a really great experience. more interval training! used one of skip orem's getfitpod podcasts again. man, it's hard! my "sprints" are not very fast at the end! but i know it'll help my speed in the long run, and i enjoy the challenge. i heartily recommend these podcasts. woo hoo--cut 48 seconds of my previous best 5k time!! wow, that's getting very close to my 10 minute per mile goal! tomorrow i'll do some interval training, then sunday is my first official 5k. hoping the adrenaline gets me down to my goal! 3.13 miles in 31:33, 10:04/mile 
Male: 100%, Male, welcome to grade 1: "alright students, what does an ichthyosaur look like?"&nbsp; "they look like dolphins !"&nbsp; " whales , like whales!"&nbsp; "yeah fish !!!"&nbsp; "shaaarks!"&nbsp; "ooo ooo, mr. bond , oooo???!"

"settle down children! children! ugh..." miga , for the uninitiated, was an olympic mascot here in vancouver - part bear and part orca .&nbsp; i assume it is the orca that billy, the made-up child in this real-life situation, is relating ichthyosaurs to.&nbsp; dolphins, whales, fish, orca - are ichthyosaurs so similar?&nbsp; or, like miga, more of a mix of creatures? or are we just imposing our understanding of extant animals upon extinct ones?&nbsp; what did ichthyosaurs look like? with these beautiful aquatic reptiles being the focus of art evolved 's next gallery , i thought we should begin discussing how exactly they should be reconstructed.&nbsp; what are the current controversies palaeo-artists are dealing with when restoring ichthyosaurs from fossil to flesh? darren naish (at tetrapod zoology) recently (sept. 2008) discussed a few of the assumptions we make when we think of what ichthyosaurs look like and how they behave.&nbsp; did they really have dorsal fins?&nbsp; how much of our knowledge of ichthyosaur body shape was faked by unscrupulous preparators?&nbsp; most aquatic swimmers ( fish, dolphins ) have a dorsal fin, two pectoral fins and a powerful tail.&nbsp; why did ichthyosaurs retain their two hind-fins?&nbsp; in an older article , naish ponders the question: did they use their pectoral fins and "fly" underwater?&nbsp; there are also a few questions i'd like to ask here, confronting the traditional view about ichthyosaurs: 1) was their skin slick and smooth like a dolphin, or bumpy and scaly like a monitor lizard? 2)&nbsp; did they eat only squid and ammonites? 3)&nbsp; did all genus of ichthyosaur reproduce through live birth? 4)&nbsp; did they partake in cannibalistic behavior? 5)&nbsp; what did the huge shonisaurs eat?

these plant-eating therapods are known to the world as therizinosaurs - named 'scythe lizard' on account of their abnormally large claws on their hands. this family of dinosaurs (therizinosauridae), previously know as segnosaurs, has a strange and convoluted history of discovery, with palaeontologists at times calling them "turtle-like lizards," prosauropods, and carnivorous reptiles.&nbsp; it wasn't until the discovery of similar genus' in the 80's and 90's, that therizinosaurs were finally classified as advanced herviborous maniraptorian theropods. recreating an animal so recently reinterpreted takes skill, research, and time.&nbsp; the wonderful results from this process are collected below - a time capsule full of therizinosaurs , recreated in glorious pencil, paint, and pixels!&nbsp; to participate in this and future time capsules, all you need to do is send your image to artevolved@gmail.com .&nbsp; it's not too late to join in the fun! so without further ado, welcome to art evolved's therizinosaur gallery! click to enlarge them! &nbsp; &nbsp; a brief look at therizinosaur reconstructions through the years by tricia arnold &nbsp; &nbsp; alxasaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beipiaosaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; erliansaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; erlikosaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; falcarius by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; nanshiungosaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; segnosaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; nothronychus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; nothronychus mckinleyi in graphite penci l by mo hassan &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; therizinosaurus by brett booth &nbsp; &nbsp; therizinosaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; therizinosaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; therizinosaur (aka chickenosaur!) by rachael revelle a4 lino print - produced as a live blog and documented on my blogsite&nbsp;' drawn in time '. therizinosaurus: a creature from jim henson's the dark crystal by sarah snell-pym i started off by looking at creatures i thought had similar features or habitat niches to the therizinosaurs and then drew a 'shape' outline from a skeletal representation p199 of vertebrate palaeontology 2nd edition. the creature seems to have had an identity crisis in the world of palaeontology but the most recent stuff i found suggested feathers and stiff hair type structures so that's what i went with. my actual aim was to build an evolution of therizinosaurs in palaeontology of which this would be one of the end members! &nbsp; therizinosaur by anthony contoleon therizinosaurus 2000 by david tana an early attempt at reconstructing therizinosaurus ( late cretaceous period, china ) , using only pencil and paper. therizinosaurus cheloniformis 2010 by david tana reconstruction of therizinosaurus cheloniformis from the late cretaceous period of mongolia, china.&nbsp; digital scan of pencil on paper. therizinosaur by craig dylke &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; giant claw by matthew tames &nbsp; here is a scene of a pair of therizinosaurs protecting their nest. &nbsp; &nbsp; therizinosaurus cheloniformis feeding on ginkgo by john meszaros the&nbsp;geometrical stone structures&nbsp;in the background&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;columnar basalt formation&nbsp;such as can be found at the giant's causeway in northern ireland or the devil's postpile in california. a slap in the face by peter bond a therizinosaurus cheloniformis repells an attack by a passing alioramus remotus on a floodplain in mongolia, 70-65 million years ago. i wanted to illustrate one of the less-shown uses of those giant claws. hopefully the alioramus can afford the facial reconstruction surgery! therizinosaurine! by peter bond maniraptors: therizinosauria by albertonykus (from shortest to longest: beipiaosaurus inexpecticus, falcarius utahensis, and therizinosaurus cheloniformis .)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the therizinosaurs were a group of strange-looking maniraptors. this caused a lot of confusion in the past. for example, some therizinosaurs (then known as segnosaurs) were thought to be prosauropods (basically all the sauropodomorphs besides the giant four-legged sauropods). it was a while before the segnosaurs and therizinosaurs were recognized as the same group within maniraptor theropods. therizinosaurs had gigantic claws, but their tiny heads and teeth suggest they were plant eaters. to be fair, they aren't the only plant-eating theropods ( [link] ), but few other theropods show such extreme herbivory. &nbsp; &nbsp; therizinosaurus by jared needle from a 13 (or 12) inch square of double mc tissue paper, violet/orange.&nbsp;&nbsp; still in progress after two months. it has literally been standing like that for a month straight before i photographed it today . it's obviously missing a head. i've gone through at least a dozen attempts over the last month, and still have yet to design a satisfactory head.

Female: 100%, Male,  another view of the maluti mountains from three fountains in the free state. for more super sky pictures go to the skywatch site. sunrise over the maluti mountains in lesotho taken from the three fountains view in the free state. go to skywatch for many more great pictures from around the world. these huts&nbsp;silhouetted against the sunset&nbsp;give an interesting view of a&nbsp;village&nbsp;in lesotho. go to the skywatch site for more great&nbsp;photos from around the world. make mine a dubble or should i say dubbel or is it double.......? i guess it doesn't matters. a specialist in court cases too? i think i may stand a better chance with my with my lawyer. . "froggy, froggy may we cross your golden river?" "no!" "why don't you rather stop for a while and admire my beauty?"&nbsp; it's amazing what you can find lurking beside the river banks. you can see the big picture or if you look more closely, you&nbsp;may see the little one as well. i came across this little fellow alongside a river in lesotho and&nbsp;identified him as an ornate frog (hildebrandtia ornata). if you are interested in knowing more about these frogs click here . this is the second of my donkey sunsets taken in lesotho. come and enjoy the worldwide skywatch experience at the skywatc h site. this bald ibis vey obligingly posed for me the other day in lesotho. i found this sign on a roadside shop&nbsp;in lesotho quite amusing. i know what chips are, but can only guess what fats are..........needless to say that with my no fat and low cholesterol diet i was not tempted. aside from the humour, it also shows an entrepreneurial spirit in a harsh environment, where there is a daily struggle to earn a living. this seemed like a desparate, or should i say novel,&nbsp;appeal for business in molteno.&nbsp;i also see that some of the petals on the flower were sacrificed, to improve the view of the sign. having just eaten a big breakfast at aliwal north we did not stop. then about 50 kilometres from cradock we stopped at the daggaboer farm stall to browse. for the unenlightened "dagga" is "marijuana" and "boer" is "farmer". yes, that is the name of the farm. apparently the name has four possible origins, but only one relates to dagga. if you want&nbsp;to hear these accounts you will have to pop into the&nbsp;farm stall and ask the owner. &nbsp;it is well worth a visit and i can highly recommend the homemade pineapple juice and ginger beer and the roosterbrood (griddle bread) and then, before resuming the journey, you can always stop in at the local loo, to have an "enjoyable farm pee".&nbsp;there is a lot of humour at the daggaboer farm stall. you can also visit them on the net. at one time our travel was aimed at getting from point a to point b as quicly as possible. these days we kind of dawdle along and emjoy the ride, looking for the these types of roadside gems.

Male: 100%, Male,  photos of borneo ----------- the borneo project (donate!) borneo - for most, perhaps, the name brings up nothing more than impressions of a vague, far-away and exotic place; others might associate it with headhunting tribes or wild orangutans. for myself, i had memories of intriguing silhouettes on the horizon - massive jungle-clad spires rising from azure seas, cloaked in mist . passing the island in transit from the solomon islands to bali aboard a tall ship in my late teens, i resolved to return to borneo. in researching more about this fascinating place, i learned more of it's history and natural wonders. the world's oldest rain forest, rapidly being destroyed; incomparable scuba diving and snorkeling; local peoples whose traditions still could be experienced first-hand, yet are rapidly changing; and the chance to see rare wildlife such as the orang-utan . lately, too, i had read much about the impact of palm plantations on the destruction of rain forest in this part of the world. in the media, this destruction has been linked to the rapid growth of the biodiesel industry - calling into question the very notion that biofuels will help our societies transition to a more environmentally responsible future. as an advocate of a sustainable biodiesel, i wanted to see and understand the impacts first-hand. a few weeks before the winter holidays, my wife and i discussed possible vacation destinations. at one point we asked each other where it was that we most wanted to travel to, regardless of the practicality. borneo came to mind, and on a lark almost, we looked into airfares and cost. surprisingly, we found that if we flew on christmas day, we could get a really good airfare. so, with only 10 or 12 days to go, we booked our flights and feverishly prepared to fly halfway around the world. what we found was perhaps one of the most active frontiers between wilderness and traditional cultures, and the modern industrial world. as with so much of this tension, much of this revolves around questions of energy, so i wanted to write a bit in my blog about what we observed. first, allow me to situate borneo in some context. borneo is the third largest island in the world, larger than texas, and is shared (not always peacefully) but malaysia, indonesia, and brunei. we visited the malaysian part of borneo, consisting of the states of sabah and sarawak, running across the northwestern portion of the island; with the exception of the sultanate of brunei, which is a small and wealthy pocket between the two states. the interior of borneo is the very definition of rugged. never having been glaciated, the landforms are quite dramatic . the rain forest is home to many dangerous animals and even plants - including a tree who's sap can kill a man in minutes if it so much as touches a small open wound. just moving through the forest is exhausting - even on a trail. the thin soil barely covers the uneven and razor-sharp limestone geology. even on flat ground the pockmarked terrain conspires with thick tree roots that criss-cross the ground to create a forest floor seemingly designed to trip and twist the ankle of the unwary . the lowlands are largely submerged in a foot or two of tea-colored swamp, and are home to several different flavors of leech which inevitably attach themselves to inconvenient areas of the body. massive walls of limestone rise at a punishing angles from the lowlands, creating ridgelines that are extremely difficult to traverse. a jungle trek in borneo, even today, is an adventure . this kept colonizers - first indian rajahs, then the english "white rajas" - marginalized in their real control of the territory to the coasts. many of the indigenous dayak peoples that live in borneo only had regular contact with the outside world (primarily missionaries) starting in the 50's. headhunting was a regular activity of these peoples up until world war two at least, with many invading japanese soldiers losing their heads to traditional, barefooted warriors armed only with machetes and blowpipes (and it should be noted, many groups were systematically slaughtered by the japanese in retribution). we met elders who had fought and taken heads as young men, and had the tattoos to prove it. because borneo is so rugged, until recently all travel was on the river systems (river travel is still by far the easiest way to get around) and almost all of the peoples lived their lives on the rivers and forests immediately adjacent. as could be expected, the rain forest is a rather inhospitable place for outsiders wishing to exploit the resources. in contrast, for the indigenous peoples, the forest is their traditional supermarket, pharmacy, hardware store and lumber yard. our guide, of iban extraction, showed us dozens of unremarkable looking plants just off the trail, each of which had numerous uses. the semi-nomadic dayak have lived in these forests for many centuries (at least) and their traditional culture is exquisitely intertwined with it. our guide lives in an apartment, spends a lot of time of his cell phone, promptly answers his email, and flies between cities to meet his clients. yet, as a youth, he learned to make fifty different kinds of traps and to hunt with a blowpipe. he estimates that he could survive for at least a month in jungle if he was dropped into it with nothing but the clothes on this back. nonetheless, exploitation of the forests has proceeded apace since the 1960's or so; beginning with logging of tropical hardwoods. the lowlands have been drained to allow access for bulldozers, lumber trucks and a massive amount of inexpensive labor (largely indonesian workers). a lot of this logging is now on the third or fourth pass over the more accessible areas, with smaller and smaller trees being taken out. now that the economically extractable timber is dwindling, much land is being cleared outright, primarily for palm oil plantations. these plantations form the backbone of a tropical oleo-economy that may be as economically and ecologically significant as the corn and soy agricultural economy of north america. those of you that follow the debates over biofuels are no doubt familiar with palm oil. this crop produces very high yields of oil from its fruits. it is farmed as a monoculture, with oil extracted using industrial-scale processes to yield a wide variety of products ranging from edible oils to chemical feedstocks. what most people seem unaware of, with all the hand-wringing about biofuels is that even without the influence of biodiesel, the spread of oil palm plantations seems inevitable. palm oil is a crucial source of cheap calories throughout the tropical developing world. almost all fried food in southeast asia and india is cooked in palm oil, and proprietors of roadside stands and small restaurants thrive or fail by the market price of this commodity. the malaysian palm oil council indicates that 90% of palm oil is consumed as food, with the remaining portion used in non-food applications (including biodiesel). this is worth repeating - at present, less than 10% of the palm oil produced globally is used to make biodiesel. the vast majority is consumed. while we were in borneo, malaysia was in a several day uproar over a rumor of palm oil rationing; of course, malaysia is one of the largest producers of palm oil, but the export market had apparently squeezed domestic supply. palm oil derived chemicals are found in many every day products like shampoo, cosmetics, and processed foods. palm oil has even been proposed as (irony alert) an "environmentally sensitive" drilling fluid for deep-sea petroleum exploration . however, that said, the demand for high-yield oil crops to serve biodiesel demand - predominately from europe - has lead to something of a gold rush mentality among palm oil plantation owners, who are enthusiastically clearing land in preparation for exponentially increasing demand; it takes nearly 3 years from the time a plantation is put in until the point the palms bear the oil-rich fruit. the increasing demand for palm oil and lag time until the plantations bear inevitably leads to boom and bust cycles. the current high price of palm oil fuels two contentious debates with regards to bio-based energy - global warming impact (from forest clearing) and the food vs. fuel controversy . recently, the european union proposed a sustainability certification scheme that would preclude the use of most palm-oil based biodiesel. this seems prudent and wise, but to date, is only a proposal. so now to the situation on the ground, by air. as i noted, until recently, the only practical way to get around borneo was by river. however, this is no longer the case. malaysian borneo is now served by an excellent and affordable network of airlines, mostly flying airbus a300's on longer routes to the bigger airports, and twin-engine turboprops (twin otters and fokker 50's) to the smaller destinations. our experience with air travel in malaysia is that it matches or exceeds one's experience in the us, both in terms of cost and comfort. it is also an excellent opportunity to see the lay of the land. in many places, what you observe is oil palm plantations as far as the eye can see. the vastness of this is hard to overstate. one can see huge areas cleared to bare soil , with neat grids of access roads, ready to to be planted; and similarly, undulating rows of palms in various states of maturity, often surrounding isolated islands of jungle atop inaccessible spires. on the ground, the experience is repeated. driving from the airport in tawau to the dive spot gateway of semporna, about an hour away, one sees virtually nothing but these plantations . it is a sobering experience to think of the biodiversity that has been annihilated by these massive developments. it is also difficult to overstate the impact on the dayak both by the plantations and the logging. many dayak have moved to the cities and live very modern lives, and especially some iban groups do enjoy political power and influence. thus, there are certainly some cases where the indigenous groups have benefited economically - at least in the short term - by these activities. by and large, however, the lions share of the economic benefit has gone directly to the largely chinese companies which run the logging operations and plantations, and indirectly to the mainland malay who enable this exploitation from a political perspective. most of the labor, as mentioned, is imported from indonesia. we visited a longhouse as part of a backpacking trip in mulu park. this longhouse is a traditional structure where an entire village lives under one roof. in practice, this is essentially an enormous low-rise apartment building with a large common veranda in front. the people of this longhouse still make much of their livelihood from the forest. the tourists that visit come to see the protected areas of the national park that abut these communities, even while some of the same people involved in the tourism trade illegally hunt wild boar inside the park boundaries (as they have for hundreds of years). one of the main cash trade activities is gathering wild fruit, particularly durian, from the jungle; as wild-harvested durian is considered to be the best of this sought-after delicacy and commands a high price in urban markets . the people who live in the longhouses still look to the forest, in short, for food, medicine, and building materials. thus, many logging concessions have met with significant protest by the indigeous people, including road blockades met with government violence . we spoke to one park guide who had been active in such a movement in his home village, who had been imprisoned and beaten. in turn, he and his compatriots fashioned handcuffs from sharp-edged jungle leaves and built a jail with walls of poisonous thorns, and informed the police that unauthorized incursions on their territory from them or any loggers would be similarly met with imprisonment. in the end, such confrontation is only a delaying tactic, and this guide recognized that the only way to preserve the forest, is for the forest to produce economic activity for his village. otherwise, there is temptation to fall prey to divide-and-conquer tactics on the part of the logging companies like substantial payoffs to prominent individuals to allow logging and plantations. while one solution is official government protection of the lands, malaysia has at times resorted to fairly heavy-handed tactics in the establishment of these national parks. for instance, on the outskirts of mulu park there is a penan "settlement" where the primary activity is sales of handicrafts (trinkets really) to tourists. the penan are not there by choice. as a semi-nomadic people with a hunter-gatherer culture that has changed little since the stone age, they were judged by the government to not be compatible with the establishment of a national park and were enticed (or forced) from their traditional lands about 15 years ago. they were told to choose between being muslim or christian, the government built homes, a church (they chose christian mostly because being muslim would preclude them from hunting forest game), and a school and have tried to teach them to practice agriculture. they were the most economically and culturally depressed people that we met in borneo. without a doubt, this sort of thing has lead to undeniable ethnic tensions in borneo. malaysia advertises and prides itself on being a multi-ethnic and harmonious state, but in practice relations seem strained at best. we met a ethnic chinese taxi driver who told us not to trust any ethic malays (as we would be ripped off); malays who were horrified that we would hire an ethnic chinese taxi driver (as we would be ripped off); and indigenous people who had no love lost for either group, or migrant indonesian workers, and were deeply concerned about ethnic tensions and resource exploitation exploding into outright sectarian violence (as has occurred periodically in indonesia). the ironic thing of course is that we were treated fantastically by everyone we met of every ethnicity; although of course, as americans traveling in a majority-muslim country, we were often offered direct opinions and confrontational questions about our government's foreign policies. even as the indigenous people fight to preserve and to have access to their traditional lands, it should be recognized that the tide of modernization is not, on the whole, leaving them behind. it was no coincidence that at the longhouse, we saw few men of working age; mostly old people, children, and some young women with families. one of the activities we participated in the longhouse was a presentation and participation in traditional music and dancing . during this, one of the few young indigenous men around was taking pictures of the dancing with his digital camera - he was clearly home on a break. we met a large number of youngsters that spoke flawless english and were getting ready for their big exams to get into secondary school and then, they hoped, into university. the interior of the apartments we saw were heavy with photos of graduates in caps and gowns; the resident's children and grandchildren. the longhouse itself - though poor by first world standards - had electricity, indoor plumbing, refrigeration , and satellite tv in many apartments. the level of material wealth present - compared, for instance, to rural africa - was very high. that malaysia - even in these outlying areas - is not a poor country comes back to the theme of this blog once again. the petroleum industry in malaysia is the engine. the petronas towers in kuala lumpar are one of the most impressive man-made sights i have ever seen in my life. these edifices were not built on palm oil profits, obviously. malaysia's "asian tiger" status is largely a function of oil wealth. their policies are leading to significant investment in education for its citizens, and economic diversification (towards the semiconductor industry for instance) which is wise. however, there is a clear sense of striving towards ever increasing material wealth that is already dramatically impacting the preservation of cultural diversity, as malaysians of all ethnicities embrace a homogenized cultural mieleu, seemingly centered on american pop music, japanese fashion, and the most impressive shopping malls one could imagine. it seemed to me that perhaps the most popular recreational activity for young malaysians of any ethnicity is to spend the day packed like sardines into a "cybercafe" where they play games (counterstrike, grand theft auto, and world of warcraft seemed popular), im, and watch youtube. at about $1 per hour to enjoy air-con, entertainment, and socializing it is indeed a good value. it is, frankly, an open question whether the rain forest of borneo can be meaningfully preserved in the face of this dynamic. hand in hand with this, preservation of traditional cultural knowledge is in question; of course, the dayak of borneo have and will continue to adapt their cultural response to circumstances. it is likely, as in other circumstances, that the young dayak will realize that their cultural heritage is fading and will work to reconstitute their traditions and identities. still, inevitably much will be lost - especially if the forest is destroyed. again, from the perspective of this blog, the question is whether renewable energy is working as a constructive and destructive force. for the dayak that have installed micro-hydro run of river systems and now enjoy electrification, this serves to strengthen their local economy and this in turn helps them preserve the forest. conversely, if the west sources it's biofuel feedstock from palm oil, borneo's transformation may be irreversible and complete. in this case, the fate of the dayak may follow that of other indigenous groups who's values, lifestyle, and location are not compatible with massive resource exploitation. let us hope that this does not come to pass. as a closing note, i can recommend the borneo project as a group that is doing great to help the various groups in borneo achieve sustainable economic activity and thereby preserve the rain forest. please donate (link at top). yesterday, the berkeley city council unanimously approved an ordinance that will finance pv systems and energy efficiency improvements for homeowners in the city. though the plan was announced last week, i haven't had a chance to blog so this is as good a time as ever to write a few words about it. when i first heard of this, it struck me as one of those "only in berkeley" type things and rubbed my libertarian streak the wrong way, leading to ornery thoughts. it's been a long time coming, right? how come the private sector can't get it together to provide financing for residential pv? it has always seemed like a fantastic opportunity for an entrepreneurial approach, so it seems like berkeley is competing directly with private enterprise here. but can you usurp private enterprise, if the service isn't really being offered by the private sector? i guess not. i've come around. the way this is structured is actually brilliant and everyone wins. so in a nutshell, the deal is that the city pays the upfront cost for the installed system. then, an assessment is added to the property tax, and through this assessment, the homeowner pays the city back with interest over 20 years. so here are the main points: first, (assuming the system is sized properly) the assessment is less than the utility savings, so it is cash-flow positive for the homeowner; and of course after 20 years, it's free power. second, the system and the assessment belong to the property, not to the homeowner. this is critical. it means that value of the system will be properly appraised as part of the property, so there is no risk of losing the value of the system upon sale of the house. moreover, whether an owner stays in the house for 1 year or 30 years, they still see all upside. third, the city is raising the money with a municipal bond; the lowest interest rate anywhere; passing this through to the homeowner helps make the economics compelling. fourth, the city gets a guaranteed revenue stream. the biggest issue that i see is that demand in berkeley is going to utterly explode. i have a hard time imagining that nearly every homeowner in berkeley who gets wind of this won't try to sign up. i don't know how any of the local installers will keep up, in the short term at least. this sounds like a nice problem to have, but of course the concern is that there could be a proliferation of naive, and in all probability (like in any "gold rush") some opportunistic new installers and service providers doing this work -- and doing a bad job. of course most new entrants will be honest and competent, but it's the inevitable bad apples that worry me. balancing exceptional industry growth and the need for installers to support that growth are the realities that properly installing 30-year service life equipment is not easy, there is a rather complex set of reliability, safety, and regulatory / rebate issues to grapple with, and customers who may not have realistic expectations due to relentless solar hype are not necessarily the easiest to please. the other substantive concern i have is if the contract with the city (and thus the assessment) includes periodic inverter replacements, or whether the homeowner is on the hook for it on their own. modules are typically guaranteed to product at least 80% of their rated power after 25 years, but most inverters carry a 10 year warranty. this means it is very likely that at least one inverter replacement at the owner's cost over the system lifetime, and possibly two, will be required. at a couple thousand bucks a pop (depending on size) this has implications for system economics. an honest and professional assessment of system economics should assume these maintenance costs as well as the slow degradation in power output. the inverter issue is quite problematic if a new owner moves in just before the inverter fails out of warranty, and then has to either shell out cash for the equipment, pay the assessment even though they are getting no benefit, or try to get the property assessment canceled (in which case the city is left holding the bag). the city says it will roll out the plan in about 8 months, so hopefully will have the foresight to address this issue. all that said, assuming this doesn't get bungled up in red tape or political shenanigans -- and there's never a guarantee there, especially in b-town -- it seems inevitable that this idea will spread quickly. one of the most interesting aspects of solar these days is the leadership of the states in successfully setting de facto national energy policy in the current leadership vacuum at the federal level. it appears that berkeley has taken this one step further. potentially, this initiative could serve as a seed crystal for a concept that could radically impact the way we produce electricity, nationally, even internationally - one town at a time. there is an excellent article on biofuels in the october national geographic . it does the best job i've seen in any mainstream publication - perhaps in any publication - of elucidating the importance of feedstocks to the sustainability and ultimately feasibility of biofuels. the article touches on both ethanol and biodiesel. with ethanol, the article focuses on corn, sugarcane (and the brazilian experience), and celluosic feedstocks and the tradeoffs of each. for biodiesel, soy is discussed but algae also gets significant attention, including a rare behind-the-fence photo at the greenfuels plant in arizona. i highly recommend picking it up for a read. it also includes a fascinating article about modern pirates in southeast asia. so you really can't go wrong. in other news, solar power 2007 was great last week. it was fun to see old friends and colleagues and there was a fantastic sense of momentum. my presentation on innovation drivers for balance of system components seemed a success, with some good questions, so that was very satisfying. i only made a couple of the other talks, the ceo forum and the closing plenary. the forum was quite interesting, with some good questions and it seemed, frank answers. main fact - national seia had a lobbying budget of just $20,000 last year and the goal this year is just $60,000. this was to me, just astonishing given the amount of money spent in washington by the mainstream energy industry. the highlight of the closing plenary was a tour-de-force presentation by the senior energy manager of wal-mart . i was not aware that they are far ahead of the pack in terms of energy efficiency in their stores, though of course i had heard of the solar roll-out. apparently this is just a pilot and if successful, wal-mart has a policy and track record of rolling out energy innovations massively. that is truly exciting stuff. i've been thinking about this next post for a bit now. i haven't had time to write anything lately but hopefully, i'll be able to post somewhat consistently over the next few months. what's on my mind is giving some advice to the those that seek a job in the solar industry. there are lots of opportunities out there for the right people, and it's a good time to get your foot in the door. at the same time, as has been noted before, the hype machine is in overdrive. so buyer beware, especially if your livelihood is riding on it. so let me first start with a cautionary tale. on friday, the entire board of directors and ceo of automatic tooling systems (ats) , the canadian company that owned spheral solar (and conventional module manufacturer photowatt ), resigned in the face of "dissident hedge fund" shareholders demanding a turnaround . ats's foray into renewable energy (as well as auto industry woes) was blamed for this sory state of affairs. spheral solar was actually shut down earier this year and ats tried to spin off photowatt in an ipo in late march, but failed . previously, spheral was touted as the best thing since sliced bread, an amazing technology that allowed them to make flexible modules, with significantly less silicon, that (in theory at least) boasted near crystalline pv efficiency. four years ago, the "new scientist" wrote this breathless article about " 'demin' solar panels to clothe future buildings"; and future pundit wrote that spheral would "start production in 2004" yet as late as january 2006 the " clean break " blog opined, referring to a deal between building products manufacturer elk (recently acquired by gaf) and spheral to make building-integrated roofing materials with the technlogy, that "the product is sold before it's even been produced. now that's the kind of certainty that investors like" . well, maybe so, but of course that only works out if the company manages to manufacture their technology on a commercial scale. if you've been following the solar industry for any length of time, you come to realize that announcements from a company of the intent to produce, or the ability to produce, or even signed contracts to manufacture and install their technologies means very little if they don't have a track record of doing so (especially if they announced, and then failed, to go into production two years prior). the point of this cautionary tale is that there are a lot of solar companies out there these days, and there are all sots of announcements and blog posts and what-have-you that make them look like just the greatest new thing. be skeptical, and be smart, because in the next 5 years or so i think we're going to see a significant shake-out occur in this business. if you are looking for a job, gut-check the risk level you are willing to take. if there are only a few employees, promises of lots of options, some venture funding and a prototype out in a garage - well, that's a high risk situation. potentially high reward if it actually does work out of course. but a day of reckoning will come for all start-ups, especially if vc funded. there are a number of well known, seemingly reputable companies that have been around for years now and have yet to set up even modest manufacturing capacity or field a market-ready (i.e. all required certifications) product. there's even one which shall remain unnamed, based in silicon valley, which is infamous for being extraordinarily well funded - yet no one i've spoken to has even seen a prototype of their breakthrough technology. that's all well and good for a while but after several years have passed, one must begin to wonder. conversely, there are more established players with a reputation, products, vision, and great growth potential; but less speculative upside. look at the bigger pattern, the fundamentals, if you will. there's nothing new under the sun (ahem). thin film was the the next big thing five or six years ago, unfortunately, there were some serious reliability issues and so much for that. now it's back in vogue. not coincidentally, this new generation of thin film technologies (most of which is not yet commercialized) arose simultaneously with a rather prolonged shortage of polysilicon, the raw material of relatively high-efficiency crystalline solar cells. same with concentrating photovoltaics, which saw a lot of effort in the '80s and up until the mid '90s, then largely abandoned as the price of 1-sun cells came down; but resurged with poly shortage driving silicon prices up. the high prices made thin film and cpv look good - trading significantly less silicon usage for low efficiency and mechanical / optical complexity, respectively. so now it's two or three years later. some of these new innovators have already fallen by the wayside, others are still working towards commercialization, and one german thin film company made it past the finish line in time and is raking it in (and good for them!). but it seems that in the opinion of most analysts, the poly situation is already relaxing as many new plants come online. the question is, will these thin film and cpv solutions still be attractive in a world that is not silicon-constrained? in a world where the pv market is being flooded by low-cost, mid-efficiency crystalline pv technology from china while a few of the more technologically positioned crystalline pv players duke it out for high-efficiency dominance, and where vertical integration appears to bring some distinct advantages? finally factor in that solar thermal powerplant technology (like the segs plants or, for a less proven example, stirling dishes) looks pretty attractive for the really big centralized solar power plant market. in other words, who's going to win? it's a tough one but that's a question i would recommend answering to your own satisfaction before choosing to sign on the dotted line. now the foregoing was perhaps more focused on the tech-type jobs but there are other opportunities out there. for instance, there are any number of installation companies out there ranging from mom and pops to installers that are becoming regional or even national players, catering to the residential retrofit and commercial markets. it's physical, outdoor construction work. if you have the right skill-set it's a good job and you're bound to learn something about solar. but still, do your homework, understand their business plan, and understand how the job might change if your employer goes public or gets acquired - and don't be shy about asking a potential employer about, specifically, what's in it for you in one of these cases. so - the best of luck to all those interested in getting a job in this space. if you are serious, i can definitely recommend showing up at solar power 2007 in long beach (september 24-27) and getting your own impression of the industry. there's even a career center and a " find your dream job in solar" seminar. ted global recently posted some extremely interesting talks from the june, 2007 conference in arusha, tanzania. among the featured speakers was william kamkwamba, the young man from malawi who built a homemade wind turbine for his family (see previous post ). i highly recommend the videos; two in particular are extraordinarily powerful and captivating. moreover, they are primarily focused on identifying and strengthing positive trends, which is a refreshing change from the litany of negativity often found when africa is discuessed. george ayittey , a ghanan economist, takes no prisoners in his powerful indictment of the corruption of africa's elites while la
Male: 100%, Male, because of the success of twister and storm chasers, when most people think of storm chasers, they think of supergeek alpha males hauling butt over the shattered debris of saner men as they skirt the edge of a city-eating tornado. while this is actually a surprisingly accurate description of a small number of chasers, what often gets lost in the editing is the sheer amount of miles that are driven in a given chase season. (in the two weeks that i tailed vortex 2, i racked up over 4,000 miles. i think the v2 total was over 10,000 miles -- that's three oil changes in the course of a month.) with those kinds of miles come breakdowns, especially in the case some of the more interesting vehicles, such as imax director sean casey's uparmored tank-like contraption, tiv 2. (in fact, if you've ever watched storm chasers, you know that it seems mr. casey's tivs break down all the time. while this may seem like weird workmanship, there's a reason why automobile eningeers get paid so much -- you start adding a few extra tons to the chassis of a stock vehicle and putting 15,000 miles of rough driving a year on it, you're going to have a lot of service stops.) above is a photo of sean defusing a bomb rejiggering some wiring underneath his tiv2 in kimball, nebraska, june 5, 2009. this was the day he (and project vortex 2) got a successful intercept in wyoming and the day that sean finally got the shot he'd been seeking for eight long years. today's photo is a shot of my usual chase vehicle -- nothing much to speak of, really, considering that i don't have any antennas sticking out of it or lightbars atop of it or anything like that. i don't keep much expensive stuff in it, either; i think next year i may even try to go without the laptop and rely entirely on an ipod touch on mobile wifi 
Female: 98%, Female, we did some more ringing in the garden this morning. when derek arrived it was raining steadily and we didn't think we'd be able to get any nets up at all. after a cup of coffee, things brightened up and we put up one 40' net.we stood in the kitchen and watched birds flying over, under and round the side of the net. it was pretty dispiriting! eventually we caught two blue tits and a great tit simultaneously, and then it got windy. so things weren't looking too good.fortunately, despite the wind and occasional drizzle, we did ok.we caught two reed buntings (we've had as many as 15 in the garden at the same time this week), which was pretty good. this one's a male. the pale flecks on his head will soon wear away, revealing smart, plain black feathers underneath.for a while it looked likely that the reed buntings would be the highlight of the morning. then we caught this bird:a great tit, you say. not very interesting, surely. well, the thing about this great tit is that it already had a ring, and it wasn't one that we'd put on. so it's come from somewhere else. in itself, that's interesting enough (we'll have to wait to find out where it was ringed).the extra-interesting thing was that the ring was a size larger than normal - a b ring (aas are the smallest, for things like goldcrests and willow warblers, then as, and bs are usually for birds like greenfinches).when young great tits are ringed in the nest as chicks (or pulli&nbsp;as ringers like to refer to them), they need the next ring size up. this is because their legs are actually fatter while they're developing!the ring still fits ok now that the bird is a thinner-legged adult, but hopefully the person who ringed it will be really pleased to hear that one of their pulli&nbsp;has made it to adulthood. the reason that great tits have such huge families (up to 9 eggs) is because many of them - 62% on average - will die in their first year. 
Female: 93%, Female, i remember years ago before i had a blackerry, before i knew anything about having this type of instant access to the worldwide web, to e-mails, to google, to bbm, i would look at my friends who would use their phones for anything else other than to make and receive phone calls or to send the occasional text as crazy or bored or lame or "too cool for school" so to speak. and don't let me get started on those who would do all this stuff while they were driving. those people were really crazy!!fast forward to a couple years ago and the acquisition of my own blackberry and i became/have become that person i so chastized. it's one thing to put one's phone to full use and by that i mean, go ahead have fun, use all the apps and gadgets on there but the thing i had come to dislike about my own phone usage was that i had become a culprit of doing these things while i was driving.the thing is i know better!! i've seen all the stories about the accidents that people have gotten into, the deaths that have been caused, that could've been avoided had that person not been fooling around with their phone. i've seen the mothers crying on dr. phil and i've seen the anguish that this basically self-serving, selfish act has wrought on the lives of so many. yet i, like so many others, just convinced myself that i was actually good at it. that it was just those people who didn't know how to text, bbm, google and drive.studies have shown that it is equally, if not more dangerous to do these things while driving than it is to drive drunk!! and that still didn't stop me. but something hit me, quite literally, when a friend of mine who drives and text

Female: 100%, Male, that was a great vacation from blogging.... o.k. folks time to get back to the kitchen....!!!!!!!! but first.... we have quite a few frustrated recipe submitters and i apologize for the delay in getting them up. will do the best i can over the next couple of weeks to cover them all. but first is first... remember the post on truly useless kitchen gadgets for the chef who has everything well quite a few people disagree with me..which is of course great! one wrote a letter and did not leave a comment, but here it is.... just wanted to comment on this not-so-useless device. if you do a lot of canning, you would like to have a sturdy jar lifter. after you have processed your preserves in boiling water for 15 minutes, you grab the wooden handles and put the red rubber curved ends under the boiling water around the neck of the finished jars and lift them out. this allows you to process the next batch without waiting for the water to cool enough to take out the first batch. your picture is upside down. elizabeth gleghorn, md director, pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition children's hospital oakland well this just goes to show you that one person's useless device is gold for another. and that is a good thing... so i apologize if i offended anyone with the useless devices in the kitchen, and if you think they are important then by all means... go for it!! well passover is upon us in a few days, so i got to go clean...ugh! but i will be posting recipes almost daily...so enjoy...and help! i have a fire in my kitchen is back..back..back! tags: cooking , baking , recipe , cooking related appliances , humorous stories , ingredients , kitchen appliance , parve (meat or milk) recipe , kitchen utensils , kosher , meat recipe , milk recipe , kosher home , spices , single parenting , vegetarian , cooking stories "help! i have a fire in my kitchen" http://fireinmykitchen.blogspot.com/ this is a new one on me. barbara over at " barbara's tchatzkahs " who recently sent in the recipe muffin meatloaf and potatoes a la barbara , now gives us a recipe from the "old country" and her grandmother. here is what she writes: today i was digging through more boxes from parents which i had in storage. my mother passed 7 years ago and i knew she had my some of nana's recipes in her things somewhere. my nana, of blessed memory, was one of the best cooks i have ever known. the oldest of 13 children and the daughter of 2 immigrants who ran from the pogroms in poland, she could make a gourmet meal out of a crust of bread and a carrot! well, almost. and i found some of them!! many of them are for baked goods (will share later) but i found her recipe for harvard beets in my nana's handwriting. while i only like beets in borscht, this was a favorite with most of the rest of my family. hope you can use this - i think she'd be amazed her recipes can be immortalized on the internet now! barbara o.k. all this is great. but first thing is first. i had to know why they are called "harvard" beets, and not just plain beets. so i went over to foodreference.com and this is what i found. harvard beets are cooked beets in a sweet and sour sauce of vinegar and sugar (with spices) and sometimes with butter and/or orange juice. supposedly created by a harvard student (or a yale student), there is also a story that they originated in a tavern in england named 'harwood' and the 'harvard' is a mispronunciation of the name. so there ya go. the reason for harvard in harvard beets. and now to the recipe! nana cecelia's harvard beets ingredients: 2 1/2 cups of diced, cooked beets 1/2 cup vinegar 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch 2 tablespoon(s) butter salt to taste utensils you need: pot for stove top recipe directions: dice and boil beets until the are soft all the way through (test with a knife) mix sugar, cornstarch and vinegar. bring this to a boil and add beets. cover and take off heat and let stand about 20 minutes. add salt to taste and butter and return to low heat until beets are warm. serve. really, is very easy. though i am not a beet lover. you can add orange juice which is also in most of the recipes i have seen as well. my father loved borscht with sour cream. i never did get a taste for it, but every time beets are served, i am reminded of eating sunday morning breakfast in "steinbergs restaurant" which was on the east side of broadway between 83rd and 84th street. amazing what memories a simple food dish can conjure!

i have a fire in my kitchen" http://fireinmykitchen.blogspot.com/ i find it incredibly revealing to look at the statistics on the blog from time to time. especially what people search for and what recipes they are looking for. consistently, over the year, two different categories rate the highest. the mac &amp; cheese recipes and lemon meringue pie . now, personally i do understand the desire to create a great lemon meringue pie but mac &amp; cheese is just so... well so easy, right? i am not really sure how to interpret this. we are talking literally way over 10,000 (ten thousand) hits during the year on mac &amp; cheese recipes! i would tend to think that simply put many people are looking for the simple, easy, and good recipes with which they can eat and feed their families without too much bother and fuss. and many of these people are simply not chefs and cooks, and want an easy way to make good food. which is something i suspected for a very long time. but i may be reading the statistics in a way i want to see them, however, nevertheless the fact remains the mac &amp; cheese recipes @ help! i have a fire in my kitchen are very popular with internet searches. so in honor of this we are going to present yet another mac &amp; cheese (coupled with mushrooms) today. macaroni &amp; cheese with mushrooms ingredients: conchiglie pipe rigate one bag of pasta - (i usually use either conchiglie (shells) or pipe rigate (elbow shells) - this should be about 1/2 kilo or 1 pound . you can of course make less or more, depending on how many people you need to feed! grated cheese - once again you can use any cheese you like. i use mozzarella and parmesan cheese. you will need around 400 grams of mozzarella (14 ounces) and 100 grams (4 ounces) of parmesan. olive oil - for the bottom of the pan that you put in the oven. fresh mushrooms (i really do not like the canned or bottled mushrooms - but you can use them as well!). 1 teaspoon fresh oregano (just a touch) or you can use the spice jar. 1 tablespoon of salted butter - my sister adds this, i do not. your choice. pepper &amp; salt to taste utensils you need: oven tempered pot or silver foil pan colander (food strainer) pot to boil pasta recipe directions: first you have to get that pasta (macaroni) ready. so put it on the stove in water, (cover the macaroni and add about another 1/3 of water to the pot. let it cook on the flame between 12-18 minutes. the macaroni should be soft to the touch when you are done but not soggy! so this timing is really a matter of experience believe it or not, cause it should be an almost exact science! while the macaroni is boiling on stove stop - cut up the mushrooms and get the oven pot ready by spreading a bit of olive oil on the bottom. pre-heat oven to 350º fahrenheit. when the macaroni is ready (remember soft not soggy! don't let it cook too much!) pick up the pot and pour it all in the colander so now you get rid of the water. now put the macaroni into your oven ready dish. take around 100 grams of the mozzarella cheese and put on top. if you are going to add butter just drop it on the top add the oregano on top. now mix it all together - (cheese, butter and oregano.) now mix in all the cut-up mushrooms. ( ack! forgot this step! kali found the omission! ) now take the rest of the mozzarella and sprinkle it all around the top. don't mix it in. this is the cheese cover. now take the parmesan cheese and sprinkle it around the middle or around the sides, any which way you like. (see the photo above) in the end you should have a cheese top. now cover the dish with silver foil - do not put that dish in the oven without it being covered! otherwise the cheese will not melt at a rate that the macaroni (pasta) is cooked. now believe it or not, this depends on the temperament of your oven. when my oven is having a bad hair day it needs say 60-75 minutes. on a day when the oven is in a good mood and does not want to do some nasty stuff to me it takes 60 minutes! what you want to end up with, is a melted cheese on top and the pasta cooked evenly. i use a glass dish so i can see the macaroni next to the glass. my kids like it crusty! now take that silver foil off, and let the dish cook for 5 minutes, so the cheese turns a nice light golden brown. don't burn it so be careful here! take it out - serve or let it cool off and put in the fridge until ready to be heated up and served. by the way this is one of those special dishes that i say - go ahead and nuke a part of it when you want to heat it up real fast and you take it from the fridge. (2-3 minutes in the microwave is usually enough!) there ya go - another mac &amp; cheese! enjoy. i love rating my own recipes. our insane cook paula cannot say a thing. hah! but this is really a two - i kid you not. not hard, easy on the hands, concentration and kitchen. enjoy it!

i have a fire in my kitchen" http://fireinmykitchen.blogspot.com/ the big book of diabetic desserts decadent and delicious recipes perfect for people with diabetes by: jackie mills (---due to layout of this review, if viewed in an rss reader, certain sections may seem duplicated.) before we begin, the review of the the big book of diabetic desserts the normal disclaimer from help! i have a fire in my kitchen. this book review was solicited by the publicists of the the big book of diabetic desserts and contains my personal opinion of the book. for kosher readers of help! i have a fire in my kitchen - this is not a "kosher" cookbook though the majority of recipes in the the big book of diabetic desserts can be used as is, or with just a few sane and healthy substitutions, can be kept kosher. it is not that difficult to find equivalent and healthy kosher substitutes these days, especially in the united states. author &amp; book details: the big book of diabetic desserts is the second diabetic cookbook written by jackie mills, ms, rd. the other one is type 2 diabetes cookbook: delicious recipes for healthier living (published by: american medical association) . of course these two books together should give the reader some idea as to where the interests of jackie mills lie when it comes to the kitchen. jackie mills, ms, rd, is an experienced writer and food/recipe writer. she contributes to many national magazines, including cooking light, family circle, cottage living, and coastal living. she was the recipe developer for the american medical association's type 2 diabetes cookbook and has contributed to weight watchers cookbooks and christmas with southern living annual cookbooks. jackie is the former food editor at redbook magazine and worked as an associate food editor at southern living magazine. she lives in new york city. the book itself: some of these recipes are absolutely incedible! forget the word diabetes for a moment. they really are impressive. man, oh man, just the names of these recipes gets your stomach juices running. but the recipes themselves are truly an art as well and jackie mills does not disappoint! there is no doubt jackie mills comes with qualifications to write such a cookbook. this is though, the first time i am actually faced with the old yet very important discussion of form versus function . one gets used to and is spoiled by incredible photographs in cook books of almost every single recipe published. indeed, it is almost a prerequisite these days in the cookbook publishing industry. and to be honest i was at first a bit disappointed that the big book of diabetic desserts did not have such pictures, especially since it deals with the topic of desserts as they usually do make the best pictures. instead the publishers opted for a few pictures in the middle of the book. so as in regard to form i was somewhat surprised. but, and this is a big but , the big book of diabetic desserts has an important function , and must also be judged on whether it fulfills that function as well. pictures will not make or break your needs of food especially if you are a diabetic, but certainly recipes will. the better the recipe the more encouraged a diabetic, or someone just interested in making sure they stay healthy, and on the lighter side of sugar, will continue using the book - and more important continue on their specialized diet. there is one more confusing aspect of this book, and though the book itself will get high marks, as it truly does contain "decadent and delicious recipes perfect for people with diabetes" this is an oversight which really has no excuse. there simply is no overall "table of contents". though the book itself is divided into sections, and each section has its own table of contents of the recipes in it, the only real way to find anything is to flip to the back index and begin to look quickly. indeed in order to discover all the yummy sections in the book, i had to flip through, page by page to mark off each section when i found it. so you will have the benefit of my work! the big book of diabetic desserts has an important function, and must also be judged on whether it fulfills that function as well. pictures will not make or break your needs of food especially if you are a diabetic, but certainly recipes will. the better the recipe the more encouraged a diabetic, or someone just interested in making sure they stay healthy, and on the lighter side of sugar, will continue using the book - and more important continue on their specialized diet. however, this is really an oversight of the layout artists, though it is a mistake and an important one that should have been caught before the book was published. cookbooks require a table of contents at the front. simple as all that. yet, and while some of the readers of help! i have a fire in my kitchen may not agree, i am willing to go easy with the lack of the table of contents because the book's function is to produce recipes for the diabetic population, and it is published by the american diabetes association and all proceeds from the book go to this worthy charity. thus, major mistakes which would get me to cringe in a recipe cookbook where the author is making all the royalties, will in this case get a mild critique and one should be willing to forgive such things in this case. so let us get positive now. the public relations piece that came along with the book is quoted below. we tend to dismiss such things, but in this case the book deserves it and you will see why later on. from chocolate souffles to blackberry-pecan tarts, new cookbook offers dozens of sumptuous desserts that are low in sugar and fat whatever treat one's sweet tooth craves -- cakes, pies, cookies, puddings -- decadent desserts are often the hardest thing to give up when on a diet. whether someone is watching calories and fat, or is living with diabetes, limiting sweets has long been the rule -- and those who seek to substitute with sugar-free, fat-free versions of their favorite desserts are often sorely disappointed. this no longer need be the case. the big book of diabetic desserts , decadent and delicious recipes perfect for people with diabetes, by dietitian and former redbook food editor jackie mills, ms, rd (american diabetes association, november 2007) offers dozens of delicious concoctions -- all developed to be lower in carbohydrates, calories, and fat. from mocha fudge sheet cake to banana meringue pie and from cappuccino crème brûlée to crispy oatmeal-raisin cookies, most of the recipes in the big book of diabetic desserts use a combination of granulated sugar, brown sugar, honey, or molasses along with the no-calorie sweetener sucralose (splenda®). the limited amount of sugar makes the desserts mouth-watering and enjoyable, but with carb counts that enable them to fit into a balanced meal plan. in addition, all the choices in the new book contain less than 1.5 grams of saturated fat per serving and virtually no trans fat. despite the drawbacks mentioned above, there is a great deal of good to say about the big book of diabetic desserts. all in all it is a cookbook well worth the effort and price, especially if you have a diabetic to feed. no one is going to believe these deserts are for diabetics anyway. so you will only gain in your reputation as an incredible cook by using these recipes. jackie mills certainly shows us that diabetic eating has certainly changed and can be quite enjoyable. in the big book of diabetic desserts, mills explains precisely how sugar functions in baked goods and in frozen treats, and offers tips for indulging one's sweet tooth in healthier ways -- such as brushing molasses, real maple syrup, or honey on the tops of warm muffins, loaf breads, or cakes; sprinkling a tiny bit of ordinary confectioners' sugar on a cake or batch of muffins; and using in-season, ripe fruit to accompany desserts, especially in place of high-fat and high-sugar frostings. she also includes advice for making the most of small servings of nuts and chocolate and for using spices to add wonderful flavors and aromas to desserts. in addition to the dozens of mouth-watering recipes, mills offers helpful guidelines for better baking -- advising buying the proper pans (shiny-surfaced, heavy-gauge aluminum), using parchment paper, and stocking one's kitchen with pastry brushes, offset spatulas, and a cookie scoop. she also offers pointers for creating low-sugar, low-fat desserts, including tips on: how to test for doneness (the same timing and visual cues don't work with low-sugar baking as they do with traditional baking); how to work with a more delicate, low-fat pie crust; and how to store baked goods made with sugar substitutes (they stale faster). "you can and should enjoy desserts without feeling that you're having something second rate or that tastes 'good for you,'" writes mills. the big book of diabetic desserts offers desserts so satisfying and delicious, they are ideal for anyone craving a sugary indulgence -- whether or not they need to watch their carbohydrates, calories, and fat. the big book of diabetic desserts is divided as follows: great cakes - page 13 quick breads - page 49 sweetie pies - page 77 smart tarts - page 107 fruity desserts - page 131 custards &amp; puddings - page 163 cookies &amp; bars - page 189 pleasers from the freezer - page 213 (i included the pages because of the lack of the toc when you buy the book!) each recipe has listed: calories calories from fat total fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium total carbohydrate dietary fiber sugars protein this is obviously kind of important for diabetics but also equally important for anyone who wishes to be careful about their food intake. let me say this. some of these recipes are absolutely incedible! forget the word diabetes for a moment. they really are impressive. man, oh man, just the names of these recipes gets your stomach juices running. but the recipes themselves are truly an art as well and jackie mills does not disappoint! i have been allowed to reproduce one recipe here. chocolate-drizzled peanut butter cake makes 9 servings • serving size: 1 (2 1/2 inch) square for a lunch box, an after school treat, a bake sale, or a coffee break, this cake is a pleasing sweet for peanut butter lovers of all ages. 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup natural peanut butter 3 tablespoons canola oil 1/3 cup granular no-calorie sweetener 1/3 cup light brown sugar 1 large egg 3/4 cup low-fat buttermilk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 ounce semisweet chocolate baking bar, chopped in addition to the dozens of mouth-watering recipes, mills offers helpful guidelines for better baking -- advising buying the proper pans (shiny-surfaced, heavy-gauge aluminum), using parchment paper, and stocking one's kitchen with pastry brushes, offset spatulas, and a cookie scoop. she also offers pointers for creating low-sugar, low-fat desserts, including tips on: how to test for doneness (the same timing and visual cues don't work with low-sugar baking as they do with traditional baking); how to work with a more delicate, low-fat pie crust; and how to store baked goods made with sugar substitutes (they stale faster). preheat the oven to 350ºf. coat an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with cooking spray and set aside. combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk to mix well. set aside. combine the peanut butter and oil in a medium bowl and beat at medium speed until smooth. beat in the no-calorie sweetener and brown sugar. beat in the egg. add the flour mixture and buttermilk alternately to the peanut butter mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture, beating well after each addition. beat in the vanilla. spoon the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. bake 20 to 25 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. remove from the pan and cool completely on the rack. place the chocolate in a small resealable zip-top bag and seal. place the bag in a saucepan of hot water. let stand 5 minutes or until the chocolate melts. snip a tiny corner from bag and drizzle chocolate over the cake. the cake can be covered in an airtight container and stored at room temperature up to 3 days. exchanges 1 1/2 carbohydrate • 2 fat calories 193, calories from fat 86, total fat 10 g, saturated fat 1 g, cholesterol 24 mg, sodium 204 mg, total carbohydrate 23 g, dietary fiber 1 g, sugars 11 g, protein 5 g of course you have other great recipes as well. ice cream cakes fruit filled layer cake with white chocolate frosting chocolate chip banana bread devil's food snack cake tropical blueberry muffins peaches &amp; cream pie cherry &amp; toasted almond pie strawberry cream cheese tart blueberry-lemon curd tart fresh berry terrine blackberries with lime cream cherry orange cobbler chocolate velvet pudding cappuccino crème brulee raspberry lemon pudding cake flan &amp; pudding these are just a few of the recipes you will find in the the big book of diabetic desserts . so despite the drawbacks mentioned above, there is a great deal of good to say about the big book of diabetic desserts . all in all it is a cookbook well worth the effort and price, especially if you have a diabetic to feed. it gets 4 stars and if there had been a table of contents even with the lack of pictures for every recipe, i would have sorely been tempted to give it a five star rating. no one is going to believe these deserts are for diabetics anyway. so you will only gain in your reputation as an incredible cook by using these recipes. jackie mills certainly shows us that diabetic eating has certainly changed and can be quite enjoyable. couple this cookbook with some other cookbooks we reviewed here at help!

i have a fire in my kitchen" http://fireinmykitchen.blogspot.com/ i can possibly get in a lot of trouble for this, as it appears on the web site of the international herald tribune . i actually read this editorial by alex beam in the friday, december 14, 2007 edition of the international herald tribune . however, this piece so belongs in help! i have a fire in my kitchen , i am just going to go for it, and hope the powers that be realize that i am posting for readers who would never have read it otherwise, with all the links and with clear note that it is from the international herald tribune. (click on the title and you will be taken to the article in iht. all pictures below were added by yours truly and not part of the original editorial.) a steady diet of blubbering about fat by alex beam boston: a year-end fixture from the newsmagazines is the year in pictures, a roundup of the past 12 months' worth of photojournalism. playboy, i'm told, used to run a feature called the year in sex. maybe they still do. so here is my annual contribution: the year in fat. 2007 was another banner year for misinformation, swamp remedies, idiocy, and plain outright lies about diet and weight, subjects that obsess americans far more than the future of iraq or the solvency of social security. if only oprah could promise new hampshire voters that they would lose seven pounds - overnight! - by voting for barack obama, then mike huckabee would have to fold up his revival tent and go home. where to begin? this spring, word arrived that victoria beckham, the former spice girl now married to underperforming soccer star david beckham, had put her husband on a "daughter diet," in the hopes that she might conceive a female child. supposedly ms. beckham insisted that david cut back on dairy products, red meat and coffee, and instead chow down on steamed vegetables, salads, asparagus, avocado, peppers and fish. of course you laugh at the intellectual mendacity of a pseudo-diet that purports to link eating habits to your chances of conceiving. but when you are talking intellectual mendacity, don't forget the harvard school of public health! without apparent irony, two of its docs, jorge chavarro and the ubiquitous walter willett, are hawking "the fertility diet," which says "10 simple changes in diet and activity can have profound effects on fertility." here is an excerpt: "the plan described in the fertility diet doesn't guarantee a pregnancy." posh spice isn't offering any guarantees either, but at least she's not charging $25. the main event of the year in fat was the publication of gary taubes's title-heavy, 600-page treatise "good calories, bad calories: challenging the conventional wisdom on diet, weight control, and disease." let's not pretend that either of us has read this book. but one of taubes's widely bruited, heretical conclusions is that big medicine has oversold the terrors of fat consumption and undersold the virtues of eating fewer carbohydrates. but wait. didn't the late dr. robert atkins preach precisely that, only to be greeted by catcalls, howls of derision, and brickbats from the medical "establishment"? maybe it's time to revisit the zone diet. the quacks are back! later in the year, the new york times food writer jane brody dropped a bomb on all those nordictracksters who thought they could "work off" the fourth slice of bûche de noël. exercise is valuable, brody opined, but not necessarily for losing weight. you'll probably eat more to compensate for the few hundred calories you burned off, plus "if you exhaust yourself by overexercising, you may do less routine activity for the rest of the day, reducing the caloric benefit of your workout." hungry for a second opinion, i consulted eileen kennedy, dean of tufts's friedman school of nutrition, who confirmed that "weight loss is unlikely to occur simply from physical activity by itself." i haven't risen from the couch since. where to end? in october, my colleague judy foreman wrote a column headlined "let the post-diet era begin." judy posed the question, "is permanent, significant weight loss really possible?" her answer, in a word: no. shortly after that column appeared, i received a press release from "renowned physician, author, and weight loss expert dr. sanford siegal" touting his "hunger-controlling cookie diet." perhaps this is worth trying. i have been self-prescribing cookie diets from dr. famous amos and nurse fields, with equivocal results. next came a missive from dr. constantino mendieta, a plastic surgeon who boasts of graduating "magna cum laud," possibly from a medical school. mendieta claims to be the "pioneer of 'the triple threat,' a buttock enhancement, waist minimizer, and lower back sculpting" procedure that requires patients to gain weight "so that [mendieta] can harvest the fat through liposuction on the flanks, outer legs, and upper/outer buttocks." aha. "he then adds an antibiotic, injects the fat into the trouble zones, and starts to craft the shape," a procedure deemed to be "not only efficacious, but safe as well." it sounds extremely safe, very simple, and costs a mere $13,000. i only hope that carl hiaasen, author of the brilliant parody of plastic surgeons "skin tight," isn't reading this column. mendieta might become even more famous than he would like. alex beam's column appears regularly in the boston globe. tags: cooking , baking , recipe , cooking related appliances , humorous stories , ingredients , kitchen appliance , parve (meat or milk) recipe , kitchen utensils , kosher , meat recipe , milk recipe , kosher home , spices , single parenting , vegetarian , cooking stories "help! i have a fire in my kitchen" http://fireinmykitchen.blogspot.com/ as readers of help! i have a fire in my kitchen know, i love meeting new people through this blog. it is often a great experience and certainly expands one's horizons. barbara sent in these two recipes below. she is a fairly well known blogger with quite an interesting background. so let me first introduce you to barbara (don't call her barb though, only barbara or b!) through the two blogs i know she runs.

Female: 100%, Female,  i was sorting through some papers i need to file away and i came across this picture i cut out of a gardening magazine. i may have shown you this one before. i think it is a gorgeous combination. as i admired it all over again, i realized that i had just ordered one of those big black elephant ears! whoo hooo....i am going to create a look alike of this planter. i even have a container in a similar blue color. this one.... i think it will work, though it's a bit smaller than i would like. now i just need to find some hakone grass (hakonechloa macra 'all gold'). i think i saw it for sale around here last year. of course that does not mean i will find it now that i want it. i often buy a plant and the next year it's no where to be found. i guess i could use any plant with grass-like foliage in a chartreuse color...of course, i can't think of any other..........can you? i am really beginning to get excited for planting time! for the past two years i have been wanting a black (really it's dark purple) elephant ear plant. i could not find one any place in my town. so when i got breck's offer today, i immediately ordered this collection: i will get one each of the following varieties: hilo beauty - heart-shaped leaves in a unique camouflaged pattern black magic - mysterious dark purple foliage up to 2 feet in length persian palm - serrated leaves up to 42 inches long pointing outward as an added bonus, they include a free polly elephant ears. they are small; just 18inches or so high. i already have one of these in a combination planter i bought last year and keep inside. i did not know what it was until today. elephant ears go quite nicely with my other tropicals -- cannas and calla lilies. if i spent $50, i got $25 off, so i also ordered another rembrandt dahlia collection. it was basically free - just tax and shipping. i really enjoyed the splotchy paint-like splatters on the ones i got two years ago. so now i am gung-ho on planting the deck containters. it's still two months away for me, but it will go by fast. i probably won't be buying any annuals again this year because i won't have room for any. anybody else ordering flower bulbs, corms, etc? i have had my eye on this vivid flower pin for some time. i think it's cute as a bug's ear, as they say down south. it's 3.5 x 4 inches across. it's made to pin to a jacket or sweater and wear like a brooch. but that is not what i plan to do with it. my thought is to affix it to a big hair barrette and wear it with some of my bright spring jackets when i pull my hair into a short, stubby ponytail. i think it will go with that bright star handbag i made a few weeks ago. this one... whoa......they will see me coming for a mile in all directions! if i like it, i will make a bunch more of them. it looks like it's pretty easy to make. my plan is to use denim and matching fabrics for the bags i've made. and if i don't like it.....well, it was on clearance for only $4.99, so i won't be out much. thank you all for the kind comments on my last post! i am finding it very rewarding to make bags to match individual outfits. i have not actually used any yet, but they are fun to design and sew. they are not the kind of bags i would take to work, but i think i will have a ball using them for my leisure activities this spring/summer. i was surprised to see a comment from my mom asking for a bag. yes, mother, i would be happy to make you a handbag. just let me know which color tulip you would like. i can be your personal handbag designer---look out louis vuitton -- zoey bags may soon be all the rage! since i am answering questions in this post, i shall answer one more: yes, dianne, that umbrella seems to be full size. if anyone makes one of these, please let me know. i would love to see what yours looks like! of course, if i do make one, i will let you know how it turned out. i ordered a safari print jacket this week. it has not arrived yet, but i printed its picture and began searching my stash to see what i could find to make a coordinating handbag. i found all of this stuff that i think will work--animal print fabric, leather, black bead trim and even a black boa! i just might run that around the top of the bag. i even have handles that are perfect - black and bronze beads. so far i have only been looking for items to use -- i have not even begun to make the bag. i'm still in the mental designing mode. i probably should wait until the jacket arrives before going further. sometimes the colors are quite different when i get the jacket than they looked on my monitor . so far this week i have made two bags and have all the materials to make #3 and i have not had to go out and buy a single thing! i love using up my stashed items--especially all those handles i bought last fall when joanne's had a 50% off sale. i have almost used them all up. i hope they have another sale soon! is this not the cutest, most creative use of an umbrella you've ever seen? it was in this month's issue of midwest living along with this watering can creation. i think they are both simply adorable and i will probably be making them soon. in the meantime i am still recycling slightly used jeans into handbags. i made this one with leather accents first: last night i finished this tulip/denim handbag. can't you just see this one with denim capris, navy shell and pink jacket? maybe some denim flip flops with 10 pink-topped toes....ah, what fun i am having making these to coordinate with the clothes i already own. i hardly ever wear those jean jackets in the first picture...i rarely wear jeans, but i think that may change this year. i am so happy to report that i received my 1 cent usb cable from amazon and it works! so now i can get back to blogging on a more regular basis. the cable postage was only $1.56, so i guess you guys were correct in saying they made their profit from the shipping ($7.49). but still it was a reasonable price and i am a happy customer! i am still waiting for the camera cord. i got an email stating that it has shipped, so i am pretty sure it's not a scam. it said it would arrive between feb. 28 and march 15. march 15! i hope it's not that long. in the meantime, i found a friend's laptop to use to pull up my pics without the cable. i've been cooking a lot. last sunday i had an oven full of ribs, baked chicken,blueberry muffins and oven-roasted carrots. there is nothing like an oven roasted carrot--they were like eating candy! all i do is toss with a bit of vegetable oil, salt and pepper and bake in 350 - 400 degree oven. this time i used 350 since that's what the other items needed. i had them on the top shelf before i put the ribs in. we've been eating this food all week. i won't have to cook until friday night when i have to do fish. no cooking during the week gives me more time to play after work. i made this handbag and am now working on some denim projects. i can't believe that this week is almost over already! who sells a $40 cable for one cent? is it just a mistake? my kodak camera usb cord has a short or something because i have not been able to pull pictures from my camera for the past week. every time i plug it in, it kills the usb port (and my internet access) and i have to restart the computer to reset the usb and internet access. i am not sure it's the cable. the camera itself could be toast, that's why i have not been posting. what's a post without a picture? i bought my camera about two years ago at staples. i went there today and they were no help at all. the young man said they could not order a new cable. what's up with that? i bought it locally instead of online so i could get service. i guess i may as well just buy online. if i can find a cable, they should be able to. after i got home, i googled it and found that amazon had the usb cable and it was 1 cent. yes, 1 cent! i thought this must be a mistake, but i ordered it anyway, thinking that if it's really a few dollars more, that's o.k. because i need it. who would bother to sell something for one cent? it's not even worth typing out the address label for one cent. when i finished the order it indeed came up as one cent + $7.49 shipping. the total price charged to my credit card was $7.50. now i am worried that it's some sort of scam. does amazon have scams? do you think i will really get this item? my time has been consumed with getting the piecing of this quilt top finished. it consists of 196 3-inch pieces, which took a lot longer than i anticipated and i cannot find the words to convey my level of happiness to be finished with the piecing! i tossed it over the table to see how it looked with my valentine flowers. in between sewing bouts, i read blogs, where through the wonder of the internet, i learned a new skill. not in a million years would i have thought that i would be surfing the recent updates to quilting blogs and learn how to do this... yes, i learned how to fold the dangling end of my tp into this lovely little fan. what fun! now that is worthy of a domestic goddess label! :)i can't wait to have company over so i can test out their reaction. . . lol. i can just hear my burly brother-in-law if he should be lucky guest number 1 (because it's only good for the first person in and then it's gone). you can learn how to do this, too. just visit this post at spun sugar qults. one afternoon i streamlined my morning jewelry hunt. i was storing all my costume jewelry in the little boxes they came in. the trouble was that i had to open them all to find out what was inside. that wasn't so bad when i only had a few. but as you can see i have amassed quite a collection in the past two years. i did not even remember what i had. now they are all out of the boxes and into clear bags so i can tell at a glance what there. now that i have finished the quilt, i hope to be a better blogger. 
Female: 98%, Male,  so this photo has finally run in vogue girl korea so i can finally share it with you. back in april i was in milan shooting the albero for vogue girl korea. it was saturday, the last day, and the fair was slowing down so i took a lazy walk around the giardino. i was on via giocatollonuevo when i looked up and saw armeowni walking down the street. actually, i saw armeowni's giant bodyguard first but armeowni was about four steps in front of him. anyway, i stopped armeowni and began to ask him, and quickly began asking the bodyguard (that guy moves quick) if i could take his photo. he asked for a business card ,which i didn't have on me, so he looked me over and agreed to let me take his picture. armeowni still looked a little hesitant but i have seen him in action enough backstage at his shows that i know he likes to be shot against a light backdrop to highlight his dark ears. he began to take his one of his trademark poses but i motioned that we should move off the street and in front of a nearby building with a light background. i motioned to his ears and said something like "bene constrasto" (not to be confused with "bene catnipo"). this instantly won a few big points with him and he was very patient while i got a couple of shots. funny thing, one of the reasons armeowni has built such an incredible empire is he is very careful with every aspect of his image. for example, when you take a photo of armeowni he will not look up at the camera until he has set his pose and checked every element of his look. you cannot take a picture of him until he is ready. as a photographer this is a pain but it is a perfect example of how he continues to worry about every little aspect - i have tremendous respect for that. the guy is in his 10's and is still sweating all the little details. this picture is for everyone who has told me that accessories are too distracting. i ask you, could she look more refined? whenever you go out shooting you'll never know who you will run into! while shooting in a new neighborhood i met silver, an assistant to rei meowakubo throughout the eighties and who helped design some of her most famous deconstructed pieces. most people wouldn't even consider wearing such an obviously dated piece but silver reminds us than every garment has it's correct context (while making it look completely effortless!). as we enter 2010, it is my wish that people will take more risks, worry less about seasons, and enjoy the playful side of fashion.

Male: 100%, Male, i seldom remember my dreams; but awoke from a strange dream (are there any other kinds?)this morning. in it i was reading a newspaper story about the titanic and in the story the titanic had drawings of various tall ships surrounding it, barques, schooners, brigs etc.apparently i was reading the story in a class of some kind and the instructor announced there was some controversy in the article regarding me and would i bring a copy of the paper to the front of the class.and that, of course, is when i awoke. i don't know about you, but i don't think stories that connect me to the sinking of the titanic are, necessarily, good omens. then again, what were all those tall ships about?and where is freud when you need him?judge of your natural character by what you do in your dreams--ralph waldo emerson 
Female: 100%, Female,  march 2002. it's march, and as such, i am going to pay homage to my little sister, katie. for some reason beyond my comprehension, my little sister is such a muse to me when i'm making a cake. for example, she inspired this beauty of 2008. march 2008. and last year i designed a cute little button-themed cake that i never got around to actually making. :( she did get a cake, so don't worry about that! she and her winterguard cohorts celebrated with a publix cake that day. this year, i definitely plan on making her another fabulous cake, since i'll be home for spring break, but i'm digressing... one of my favorite cakes ever was also inspired by and created for katie: march 2007. isn't it a beauty? all those different elements... the royal icing cauldron, the fondant leprechaun, the hard candy rainbow... if you were wondering, yes, i did make that rainbow all by myself. i made &amp; colored the hard candy all by myself, i melted it in the oven and made a rainbow shape and made a second one just in case this one broke... all on my own. and let me tell you, it was a lot of work! but so, so worth it, right? i can't take all of the credit either... little sisters aren't good for much... ;) but my little sis has the ability to push my skills and talents past the limit and help me grow as a person... or at least, a cake decorator. so, katie, this one's for you. for taking me out of my comfort zone and asking for the craziest, wildest cake ideas and believing that i'll actually be able to create them. love ya, chica! if you noticed, there was recently a poll on the blog about your favorite cupcake flavors. according to tlc cooking , these are the 10 most popular cupcake flavors: chocolate &amp; vanilla-- it's classic, simple, and has something for everyone. red velvet-- 'nuff said carrot cake-- vegetables in cupcake form? oh yeah. peanut butter-- why didn't i think of this combo?? lemon-- if life gives you lemons, make lemon cupcakes chocolate-- a personal favorite coffee-- one of the few times i love coffee banana-- i love banana bread but never tried a banana cupcake pumpkin--&nbsp; one of my favorites vanilla-- booooring ;) and according to my blog readers, these are the favorites: chocolate/vanilla combo-- surprise! but what do you like better: chocolate icing with vanilla cake, or vanilla icing with chocolate cake? chocolate with chocolate frosting vanilla with vanilla frosting-- apparently y'all aren't very adventurous with your favorite cupcakes. chocolate...vanilla...chocolate...vanilla... but the people have spoken! strawberry and&nbsp;red velvet tied for fourth german chocolate, lemon, and banana are fifth carrot cake, coffee, coconut, and peanut butter all got one vote each for 6th place mostly i was just curious about what other people think of cupcakes. in my family it's pretty biased: the majority wants a chocolate cupcake, but there are strong contenders for lemon and vanilla. however, depending on how things go, i might put this information to use when (if) i participate as a vendor in my town's annual arts &amp; crafts fair. i want to sell cupcakes, cookies, and cake balls, but i'm not sure if i'll be able to, due to time constraints and the like. i'll be sure to keep y'all posted though! i haven't posted in a while, so i thought i'd share some of my older creations. first up, we have the truck road race cake i made for james' fourth birthday. he's 11 now, so that was seven years ago. (wow! that was really long ago) what do you think? has my decorating skills improved since then?? ;) next up is a haunted house. i think i made this one four or five years ago. i was still learning about piping and coloring icing... so the coloring is a bit off. but those are some awesome ghosts, right?! and finally, the pirate cake. man, oh man, i remember this cake. i definitely made it three or four years ago, and my blood sugar was screwing up, so i wasn't in my best creative mood. and the icing had little chocolate chips in it, which was way too frustrating. ta-da! not too shabby, all things considered. that's all the cake i've got to show off for right now. :-) i applied for some jobs this week, since i have a car now, so send some good wishes and prayers my way! i definitely want to start decorating cakes on a more regular basis. so these are the first ever superbowl cookies that i ever made, way back in 2007. in '08 i made little footballs in '09 i made footballs and helmets as you can tell, i've come a long way since the bears played the colts. &nbsp;i now use royal icing instead of buttercream (and the proper consistency of ri) to decorate the cookies, and i found appropriate cookie cutters. if the horse looks a little funny to you, it's because i had to find a picture off the computer and trace that-- i didn't have a horse cookie cutter! (i do now, though, thankfully!) this year, unfortunately, i won't be able to make superbowl cookies, since i'll be away at school, instead of attending the annual church party like i have the past 3 years. but i hope you enjoyed this little flashback into the past, and enjoy watching the game tomorrow night! (or, not. i don't even think i'll be watching it, but who knows?) today, two of my friends told me that they're working on a new project, involving their future career and/or favorite hobby. and i thought, i need a project of my own . so... if anyone could loan me an oven, a few pieces of wood, a jigsaw, an industrial-size mixer, and probably a blowtorch, i'll get to work on it. or maybe i've just been watching too many episodes of ace of cakes? but in all seriousness, i did come up with a cool new cake design which may or may not defy the laws of gravity. it might have to be a summer project though, because it is seriously epic. more details later :d everything hurts: my back is sore from leaning over. my legs and feet ache from standing up all day. my arms tire from kneading. my clothes and face and new apron are covered in sugar. but i couldn't be happier. i got to bake. and i believe, without a doubt, that baking is the surest way to cure stress. for me at least. there's just something so relaxing about going through the motions of rolling out dough, and thinking on your feet when you can't find an ingredient, solving problems like too-hot ovens, and finding the best creative way to decorate. i can just let go of all of my problems (and let me tell you, last week was problematic for me) and focus on that task in front of me. so thankfully my very good friend joy took me home to bake with her and megan and her awesome parents bought cookie mix and let me have run of the kitchen :) it may not have been the weekend i was hoping for, but i have a fresh outlook on life. especially since there is a tupperware of a couple dozen sugar cookies (decorated with marshmallow fondant ... i actually did a pretty stellar job this time! i don't think anybody ever tells you what a sticky, gross mess it makes at first and how long it takes to knead, but by god, i did it right!) and a popcorn cake in my dorm. life is good. i would like to sell some of my baked goods (cookies, cake balls, cupcakes, etc) this summer at our city's annual crafts fair. i remember last year i thought about selling crocheted items, but that is a lot of time to invest so i sorta scratched that idea. and i like cookies better anyway. :-) but i don't know what the laws are like in my state (georgia)... do i need a licensed or commercial kitchen? or is my home kitchen sufficient? do i need a permit to sell at this festival? it's just a one-time deal, maybe i'll do it again the next year if it's a success. so if you know the answers or where i can find information, i would love to hear your thoughts. thanks!!! xoxo, kelsie ta-da! here are the finished cupcakes that i alluded to yesterday, and they are all in their entirety (unlike yesterday, when i started eating the gingerbread man before i took a picture). oh, wait. that guy in front looks a little crippled. &nbsp;well, to be fair, they are irresistibly yummy. i started out with a box of turtle brownie mix that my grandma gave me, and a sleeve of 500 christmas cupcake liners. and so, the idea of brownies that look like cupcakes was born! plus, it was a snow day, and i was stuck inside because of the below freezing weather and icy road conditions. be warned, though, that the brownies stuck to the cupcake liners. maybe it was the caramel? or maybe i should've sprayed pam on them first? i'm really not sure about that odd phenomenon, but if you have any ideas, let me know so i can improve next time. then, since i had this really cute idea in my head about snowflake sprinkles and tiny gingerbread men, i wanted to decorate them... you can't really tell, but that's a 2-foot piping bag i've got in my hands. when i decided i needed a bigger bag to ice cupcakes with, i figured i'd just go with the biggest size available. well... maybe an 18" bag would've done the job just as nicely, but without being quite so intimidating. then came the sprinkles... and finally, the finished product! and many thanks to sarah, who helped me out and decorated some of these cute little guys with me! i must warn you, though, that these are really sweet and rich. i think a normal chocolate cupcake would fare better with all the decorations, and leave the brownie cupcakes to stand on their own merit, with maybe a small swirl of fudge icing for garnish.

Female: 100%, Female, almost a year ago today, i was told i had less than a year to live. after two months of deteriorating health, unsure diagnosis, wrong diagnosis's, different medications, and a mind full of questionable thoughts i was told what i feared the most. i didn’t cry that day, or the next. i accepted my fate and i remember just trying to show everyone in my life that it was okay. i came to really realize what the meaning, ‘everything in life happens for a reason’ truly meant. i figured that there was nothing but hard times to come and honestly i was okay with that. this past year has been difficult in many different aspects. i’ve watched my family and loved ones cry with tears of sorrow and tears of joy. i’ve had breathing tubes put in and taken out. i’ve struggled with learning to walk again, and being able to hear my own voice after four weeks of being unable to speak. i know that the ups and downs i faced last summer are never going to even compare to the things i’m going to encounter in the future because nothing was that difficult. if i were to experience this again, i would accept it as i did the first time around. despite the hardships that came with what happened, i was surrounded by loved ones every single day. and if things were to happen differently, if things were to be worse, then that would be fine because i can’t change what’s already going to happen. the only things i can change are my attitude about it, and make the most out of what was to come. to be honest i never thought i would have had such a great turnaround. i remember thinking in the hospital that there wasn’t anything i could do, but when things started to look better, when i was still able to lift my left hand up, when i was starting to regain a little strength i knew i couldn’t waste it. i knew that i had to keep trying, keep fighting, and keep doing my best to get past whatever it was that was holding me back. even to this day despite multiple doctors’ visits, mris, cardio appointments, etc, the doctors are still unsure of what exactly happened to me. they think it’s an isolated case, a onetime occurrence, but they said they couldn’t say that for certain. all i know is that without the love and support of the people around me, the people i don’t know, the amazing hospital staff at children’s (21 is the age limit there! aha!) i wouldn’t be where i am today. you all made me keep fighting, you all gave me the strength i needed to push myself, your support kept me from giving up in the moments where that’s all i wanted to do. so thank you for your thoughts, for your prayers, and for just showing me love in the time where i needed it the most. and i hope that you all know i appreciate everything you’ve all done, and i care about each and every one of you (even if i don’t know you, or we don’t speak anymore). i wish you all the best, and i will keep doing my best to make a difference in this world and to show you all that your thoughts weren’t wasted. hi everyone, i haven't updated this blog much lately on account of there isn't any news for me to share with you all in regards to my health, plus i update my personal blog. other than the good news of my life has returned to normal, and whatever in my brain has been shrinking, there isn't much for me to add. i have a math final tommorow, and this quarter is pretty much over and done with. also been working around 4 days a week. been saving up money for my big trip. i thought you might all want to see the mri's i had done, these are just two. my first one ever taken, and the circled red area is actually the inflammation (what i shall refer to it as) its' really big that's why the doctors were so insistant that it was a tumor. this was taken in june of 2008. this second picture is a different angle, and the circled area is the spot/what's left of the inflammation. it's pretty much smaller than a pea, which is great news. this picture was taken october 2008. a very big change in 5-6 months. i just wanted to say thank yuo all again for everything, and for keeping me in your prayers. also i cut off about 3-4 inches of my hair yesterday, so here's what i look like as of right now! maybe i should upload a video of me doing a strenous exercise or something to show you guys my progress! first of all, i feel exteremy lucky and blessed to able to share good, no great news with you all. it's almost as if i've been given another chance to make the most out of my life. god has blessed me with great people, and a challenge, that i am overcoming. today i went to childrens to get the results of my mri from last week. the neurologist told me that they still don't have a clear idea of what it is, or what made it occur. the tests they sent out over the summer with my blood, etc all came back negative/normal. so that's a pretty good sign. then she showed me pictures of my brain. she showed me the original mri picture from back in august which showed a very large white spot in my medula, and then she showed me the picture from last week's mri, and the white spot seems to almost be gone now. which means that my brain is getting back to normal (the color), and it's only got a very little spot of gray/white left. so everything is getting better, and they want to keep me on surveilance for awhile. my next mri is going to be in january before my trip, and then after that i only need to get an mri every 6 months, so things are going good! also on another note i recently came into news in regards to some people that i do not know. and it's really sad because sometimes its so hard to believe that some people are so unhappy to the point where they need to end their own lives. i know people suffer, and people hurt but i just wish people didn't hurt to that point, that extent. life is so precious and we're all only given one. maybe someone had a bad day, maybe someone had a lot of bad days, maybe it was just a fluke. i don't know, what i do know is that we all have the power to make other people feel better about their situations, whether it be by offering a smile, giving wave, being courteous, or even holding a door. we all have the power to do something and to brighten someones day, so we should. why let people suffer quietly? why let people harbor pain? why let people think that no one cares when we do? this whole sitaution has changed my outlook on life, and the values of family and friends. there's never a moment now where i don't want to do something for other people, and it's not because oh 'i should', it's because i want to. and i hope you all want to bring happiness to others, even if you don't know them. sometimes all they need is one person to show them that things can be okay, and that strangers care. you've all shown me you care and for that i am eternaly thankful, without it i don't know where i would be. for the past two or so weeks i've been having headaches, they're not bad headaches, nor do they hurt. they're just annoying, and on the same side of my head every time. so my follow up mri and neurology appointment isn't until november 17 and 18, however i saw my doctor on tuesday and she made a call and i had an mri this morning at 7:15...which was very early, especially for me. i had to leave at 6 am! but the mri went well, and i'm just waiting to hear from neurology in regards to how the scan/my brain looks. i hope that things continue to improve for me, and apart of me knows things will, things always get better. but if they don't, then that's okay too, becasue everything happens for a reason. i'm not scared or worried in regards to any of this business going on, i'm just trying to make the most out of everything in my life at this point. school's not bad, but doing a full load online sure is not that fun! i started working again too, 4 days a week, it's not bad either. i need something to keep me busy. my friends have been great, hanging out, treating me like i'm normal again. which i'd like to think i am, other than the fact that i have to take heart medication. i feel like things are normal for me again, and i feel my old life habits resurfacing. althoguh some are difficult to ignore, others aren't. i still am striving towrads a better life, etc. and today i realzied what one of my possible careers is/will be. i have a few, but this one i really want to see out. i'll update once i get the results of my mri. thank you for checking this blog, and for praying for me. i cannot stress enough how much i appreciate everything you have all done for me. the world needs more people like this. also dont' forget to vote! hey all, some news for you, (finally an update) i had a cardiology appointment a week or two ago, and they said that basically i'm giong to have to stasy on my heart medication. i had a few episodes when i was in the hospital where my heart would beat up to 200 bpm. so anyway my heart still does a fast beat sometimes out of nowhere but not anywhere near as bad, almost like i went for a run and its beating, trying to slow down. i had a followup appointment wtih the whole rehab team today, and basically i'm doing really good. my strength's come back, etc. they even told me that they hadn't ever seen such a big turnaround ever. so my appointment went well, and i'm basically cleared for driving/traveling. even though i started driving again a few weeks ago aha! i have a followup with neurology in november and another mri in november, and hopefully it shows another improvement! on another note, tommorow is my last day of physical therapy! :) thank you all for the continued prayers. sorry for the delay, it's hard to come up with things to say especially when your days consist of physical therapy, exercises, and hanging out. i thought it would be boring and repetitive to tell you all the same thing, over and over again. anyways i've got a slew of doctors appointments coming up in the next few weeks, (probably something i mentioned before). things are going well for me, i'm still trying to do my best. i find myself growing snappier at my family over little things, and i'm trying to stop that because it's uneccesary. and besides a happy wennie is a better wennie! :) on to some intresting news! i finally got my new tattoo yesterday, i was stuck between two choices. the first was the word 'rescued' because i feel like everything that happened to me in a way saved my life. i mean it sounds stupid, but apart of me really feels as if this was supposed to happen. almost like the life i was living before just wasn't good enough, and this thing that happeend to me, forced me to accept things that i didn't want to or could accept before, forced me to push harder, forced me to just be better, to live better. that's why i feel like this thing that happened inside of my brain rescued me, it rescued me from my own life. i don't care if people think it's stupid, or dumb because it's got meaning to me and that's all that matters. it's a reminder of what happened, and what i need and should strive towards. it's also on my right arm because 1) i've already got a tattoo on my left side and 2) its right under where they give me my iv's for my mri's (just another reminder that i've still gotta keep pushing and giong). i'll try to come up with more intresting things to tell you guys, therapy is going well and the strength is returning and almost equal at least in my legs. i think it's almost the same in my arms too! i feel like my health is improving, and i'm putting on weight! below is a picture of my new ink. thank you for your continued prayers and good thoughts! i will do my best to update more frequently! hi everyone, i've been home for almost two weeks now and things are going very well. the tingling and numbness i felt before i entered the hospital have gone, and i feel my body becoming normal again (back to what it used to). i still do physical therapy and i'm diong it three times a week, and after next week it'll be reduced down to two times a week. i'm able to sprint now and squat down, which dosen't seem like much but for me it's a big improvement. i remember the first time i tried to squat down i fell, also the pain in my legs is gone when i walk so it's easier for me now to be walking a lot. i have another followup in two months for my mri, and a cardiology appointment in the next few weeks to see if i need to stay on my heart medicine, and a follow up with the rehab doctors (all my therapists too!) at the end of september to make sure i'm on track. i plan on doing a full course load at school this quarter, joining a gym, working on my business, and getting a job as a mentor at a non-profit clinic. things are looking up and i'm pretty happy. below is a picture i put together from my time in the hospital to show yuo all the differences. thank you all again for everything yuo've done for me, and for praying for me and keeping me in yuor thoughts. i'm home! i've been home since yesterday and it's so nice to be back again. things have been going pretty well here, i start physical therapy at olympic on tuesday for 3 days a week, my previous pt therapist only thinks i need it for a month so hopefuly its only that long! no traveling at least until january but that's okay, i decided not to drop out of school and continue to do a full load this fall all online though! the doctors still are unsure of my diagnosis. i had an mri yesterday and it showed another slight improvement. my next one is scheduled for two months from now, which is when my follow up appointment is. hopefully things continue to progress at this rate. :) thank you all again for everything you've done for me! 
Male: 100%, Female, slickly produced programs were provided on chairs, but it was too dark for ad broads to read, even by the light of their iphones. so i had no idea that ad broad was a finalist. honestly, hadn't seriously considered that a blogspotter who can't speak a speck of html could be thought of as a "hero of the internet." halfway through the ceremony, my companion and housing host announced she wasn't well (maybe the chicken-fried chicken?) and i drove her home. what a thrill to receive news (via twitter of course) that ad broad won in the advertising blog category.congrats to all winners including deep focus, firstborn, rga and others. lucky for us and appropriate to the category that prizes are items more practical than dust-gathering engraved statuettes: flash drives. thanks to you who kindly voted on this proposed panel last fall, i'm on my way to austin where @bettydraper will be presenting a session on brand fiction: what the heck is it? what can it do for your brand? how to integrate it into current marketing efforts? it's been recommended as a top sxsw panel for business and highlighted in sxsworld and by the sharp folks at razorfish. if you're putting your sxsw schedule together, hope you'll consider joining @roger_sterling (michael bissell) and me at 3:30 on saturday for "rules of brand fiction from twittering mad men." a little fun before happy hour! brilliant marketing move for two companies: the newest line of barbies will include men-mad men. according to the new york times today
Female: 88%, Female,  some gorgeous flower pcs made by rita saardi as a premise of beautiful dancers wearing silk dresses for peter copping / nina ricci. i had blogged about rita's beautiful work in a previous post here . this talented budding fashion designer (who is definitely going places) was recently invited by the house of nina ricci to collaborate with head designer peter copping for the fall 2011 show. you can follow this exciting adventure with her on her blog here . you go girl! x designed by georg bohle , this cool oak dining table neatly conceals an electric piano. just lift up on the wooden tablet cut into one edge and you are ready to dazzle your dinner guests (via cribcandy ). i am so fantasizing about being living in a house like this. i love everything about it, everthing down to the pirate flag. (photography by anitta behrendt ) i simply love these dino wallpaper by paperboy , the wallpaper specialists for boys. would be lovely if they also had the decal versions of this of these dinosaurs! available here ! i love these vintage lamps by kathleen hills. the vintage glass shades have been sourced by kathleen and given a contemporary twist. i think thse beautiful hanging lights will add just the right touch of soft vintage style to any bedroom. i love the simple and modern look of these chairs by american designer von tundra . built with domestic white oak, these chairs (named the prairie chair) are inspired by reductive modernism and the farmer-made furniture of the american midwest. designed by elding oscarson, the interior walls of this graphic design office in stockholm are made up of literally thousands of magazines. i like how this original idea for a wallpaper reflects on the business of the graphic design company. simple yet stunning! this grass green carpet is a perfect present for any football fan (young or old) and is designed by karin mannerstål. karin is a multi-talented designer who is working with many different materials and media. she has, among other things, designed things for ikea of sweden. available here 
Male: 96%, Male, i received a fun email yesterday from lindsay, telling me about the "co-ed bent objects birthday party" she had. she and her friends created some pretty good bent objects-like scenarios (i especially like the burrito one), and i'm flattered that she chose my work as the theme to her party and to have fun with.also, i shared on my twitter a while back a link to szymon's inspire me now blog. it was quite a hit. need some inspiration, or just feel like checking out other people's awesome work? you should go there. right now.speaking of being inspired by things on the web-i've been thinking a lot lately about how i believe that the web is speeding up creative's progressions. of course, it's speeding up learning and sharing in every field, from scientists being able to share findings with each other in real time, to people sharing info on twitter to form instant political protests. my particular interest is about creativity though. no longer do artists have to wait to have a gallery showing to get a lot of feedback. they can join an internet group and show others their work, and have discussions about it. no more waiting on a certain book or even a certain magazine to come out to see what the rest of the world is doing. the give and take between people who create is now happening on a daily, hourly, and instant basis. i find this all kind of mind-blowing whenever i think about it. if you love art, design, crafting, film, animation, etc, these are extremely exciting times
Female: 100%, Female,  post note: little bunny died about three hours after i brought him in house. i'm sure the stress was just too much for him. he seemed to be picking up some speed at one point. it is all for the better. he was warm and cared for. i found a wounded bunny near a hay pile i was moving by the lamb stalls this morning. he had tucked himself into the safest spot he could, and squeaked when i was near by. his hind leg has a puncture wound, through to the bone. he's alive, but i've had my dr. quinn episodes with bunnies, wildlife doesn't fare well with human interference even when well intended. i imagine a cat got him. i iodined it after saline bath. he is more alert than when i found him, and i have him at my desk safe from puppies and wandering felines. not sure if he will make it. he'll die attended though, although the sounds of the dogs playing is probably not helping. he is calm when held. the wandering array of life continues, as does pending death. these little episodes are not meant to distress, but to remind us of the bigger picture. life is temporary, and can be snapped away in a bite by man or beast. the conflict of having compassion for but raising livestock to sustain me, the conflict of helping a bunny that eats my food...intertwined. lilly had her lambs last night. she finally started labor around six p.m. and we came to the barn a few times to find her still in pre labor. this early morning we arrived to find lambs, two beauties. the male is very large, and already eating a little grass this usually doesn't happen for a few days or more.] the girl is this wonderful strawberry blonde. sadly, on my second trip to the barn, she had torn her eyelid on a piece of the lambing pen - i treated with saline and antibiotic and think it will heal fine. lilly is one of our work horse sheep - always calm, and stoic. she's a big girl who throws strong lambs. i was concerned she had held out this long, as we never have lambs past 3/12...and of course my over active imagination drummed up all sorts of possibilities. i tortured myself by re-reading my sheep books about possible causes, and lay in bed last night with visions of lilly lying in breach birth trauma...but i guess mlle. nature just wasn't ready to pop those two out, and they arrived very mature - with ears already standing by morning. normally i wait at least one day to put mom and lambs out, but it's sunny and warm, and lilly is an old pro. it's less stressful than being separated from the flock. they develop so much faster - i find - when they can go outside. i want to thank all the nice thoughts people held for us this season- i have to say, i feel like a boulder has been lifted off my chest. the trauma of last year really made a mark on me, and martyn, and it showed this season. we lost the stillborn girl, and i still fret about the surviving twin's rattle, but all in all, we are pleased. and relieved. as the last ewe to lamb, lilly rests, and waits. and one of audrey's boys catches some sunny zzzzz's. on what most likely was a chilly march 10th in 1958, in a hospital room at st. mary's in rochester, minnesota, i came bolting into the world at precisely 10:18 pm. and so begins the story which over the years has reached mythical proportions- how i almost killed my mother on my birthday. perhaps it is one reason i chose to never have children - my own mother terrified the heck out of me with my own birth story. in all seriousness, my mother did almost bleed to death, and i have this scar she likes to point out on my forehead from the momentous occasion. supposedly my father looked pale and upset when he saw me because i was pink and red and lobster like, where as my brother came out a year earlier looking like jfk - seriously, for years my mother compared my brother's looks to jfk. i was compared to a lobster. and hours before i barged out of the womb, my father had been called to the morgue, where his 57 year old mother lay dead, of a heart attack, diabetes related. her untimely death led me to receive her name, katherine, instead of bridgette which my mother had picked out. i cant imagine being named bridgette, although as a child i liked to tell this story, since bridgette bardot was all the rage, and as a chubby little redhead, i thought bb was quite the cat's pajamas. so i can only imagine the yin and yang and surreal quality of that cold march night for my father. i wonder if there were things that brought it all back to him as he aged. did the sound of heels on a linoleum floor late at night bring back a sensation of the events he dealt with that night? as i get older, 52 years older to be exact, i can understand how this moment is burned into my mother, or father, in some kind of post traumatic stress way. but being true minnesotans, we carried on, and every year, my mother made me one of my favorite layer cakes- at the time it was white cake with pink butter frosting. in time, my tastes changed to german chocolate, or her white cake with chocolate frosting. i still have the same recipe cards she hand wrote so many years ago, all spotted with vanilla stains. while i appreciate that i was born, i am not one of the people out there saying that birth is beautiful. in fact, i couldn't disagree more. it's an intimate moment of a mother creature being out of control of her body. miraculous, yes, but not beautiful. i get just about as much birth as i need on the farm, thank you very much , and all the blood, after birth and vaginal prolapses that come with it. i think birth is traumatic, terrifying, bloody and completely chaotic. it's a mess. in fact, it makes no sense. a creature pushed out of a keyhole - that's not beautiful, it's bizarre. it's a miracle, but it's not beautiful. but it's the only way to get a foot in the door, isn't it? staying in a womb all your life would be safe, and warm, and inexpensive - no taxes, no maniacs on the radio shouting at you. but there would be no grand entrance, no kisses, no pie made with the first strawberries, no front row seats to neil young. no puppies. no showers on a hot day. no hand to hold when a father dies and no little mouths to feed when a mother dies. no matter what creatures come into your life, mothering is the beautiful part of birth. that some one would go through that trauma to give another creature a way to get their foot in the door of this big, messy place called life. the winds have come in, it's bone chilling. all day i was carried back to a place i liked to hide when i was little, a grove of sumac bushes out behind our house. alone, i felt protected, but spooked at the same time. rushing back to the house, i'd hear the wind blowing buckets and roof tops, and it felt scary like the wizard of oz. but home was warm, there was homemade cake even on my non birthday. it wasn't messy. it's like that today - the sounds of the barn roof rattling in the wind are spooky, but i feel safe in the barn, surrounded by my mothering ewes. together with my flock, i experienced the trauma of last year's lambing, and just like my mother did after my birth, i carry that trauma with me in a little surface wound, in danger of getting reopened if i bump it just right. i realized it's my very own birth story, and it's required if one expects to find a sense of place in this messy world. march 10, post note: daisy presented my with two healthy lambs this morning, a perfect way to start my birthday. they've made it 8 hours...we'll hope they do well tonight. they appear okay. i saw some tail wiggling while at the udder [ asign they are getting milk]. when i saw these pictures, i was quite amused at their expressions. amazing how they adapt. we are grateful for the sun and warmer weather, to help our lambing week along. these are fern's lambs, now one week old. we had hoped more of the girls would lamb this weekend - perfect weather. i knew everyone of the 5 ewes was ready to pop, but i like to keep them up and atom until they really go down into labor. the new mothers can surprise you though - i once had a new mom waddling casually back to the barn with her baby half way out. so last night i was pretty sure nelly moser would lamb. and she did. i have been somewhat concerned about what type of mother nelly would be- of all our sheep she is somewhat flighty. arriving at the barn, there she was with two fresh lambs, probably born around 8 am. but she wasn't caring to them very proficiently- she wasn't licking them or chortling much. one was quite dopey looking and chilled, not a good sign. i checked her udder and she had milk, and both ram lambs did suck on my finger, another good sign. i opted not to tube them [a procedure where you insert a stomach tube and force feed], and gave him milk from my finger instead. i decided to take them outside since it is sunny and much warmer outside than the cool barn. nelly was just a bit clueless, but she's adapting. she is chortling more, and can get them to the udder, but she's not as good as the pros at helping them 'get it". she did not dry them off well either, and i had to step in and help. within a half hour, i had them warmed up, thanks to the towel and the sun. we will just have to watch them and see. in the last 3 hours, i think both mother and lambs are adjusting to the newness of everything. and the other girls wait...here's lilly, who i'm sure will go soon. in fact, they are all showing signs of pending labor. the rules of this game are simple: wait...watch...then run with all your heart to where ever the guy in front of you runs. 
Male: 73%, Male, today was the eastern star school of inspection here in ames. our instructor (on the right) is jean who threatened me with a lawsuit if i put her pictures on here. not to worried about it. on the left is the secretary of the board of custodians and a past grand matron of iowa. these women have memorized the entire eastern star ritual opening, closing, initiation and they come once a year to sure that the chapters are doing the work correctly.
Female: 100%, Female, i've just got back from the hairdresser's, and talking to you. i left at 5.00, and have just got back. i don't know whether i should feel ridiculous or relieved. maybe (and you know who you are) you'll email and let me know. 1 january 2010 from john o'donohue (1956-2008), a blessing for your new year: beannacht ("blessing") on the day when the weight deadens on your shoulders and you stumble, may the clay dance to balance you. and when your eyes freeze behind the grey window and the ghost of loss gets in to you, may a flock of colours, indigo, red, green, and azure blue come to awaken in you a meadow of delight. when the canvas frays in the currach of thought and a stain of ocean blackens beneath you, may there come across the waters a path of yellow moonlight to bring you safely home. may the nourishment of the earth be yours, may the clarity of light be yours, may the fluency of the ocean be yours, may the protection of the ancestors be yours. and so may a slow wind work these words of love around you, an invisible cloak to mind your life. sorry haven't been here for a while. trying to go forwards...hope you are all well and using up the last of the year well. during the week i got onto a tube in london feeling very tired and despondent, as you often do cramming onto a tube at rush hour, and without a book to read i stared up at the adverts and amongst them was this poem. it is called 'prayer' and was almost in answer to one in that moment, and was so lovely i thought i'd put it here. i hope you think so too... prayer - carol anne duffey some days, although we cannot pray, a prayer utters itself. so a woman will lift her head from the sieve of her hands and stare at the minims sung by a tree, a sudden gift. some nights, although we are faithless, the truth enters our hearts, that small familiar pain; then a man will stand stock-still, hearing his youth in the distant latin chanting of a train. pray for us now. grade 1 piano scales console the lodger looking out across a midlands town. then dusk, and someone calls a child's name as though they named their loss. darkness outside. inside the radio's prayer - rockall. malin. dogger. finisterre not sure why, but this poem seems appropriate today. sonnet to orpheus oh you gentle ones, every once in a while step into the breath that is indifferent to you, let it be parted on your cheeks, behind you it trembles, reunited. oh you blessed ones, oh you whole ones, you who seem to be the beginning of the hearts. bow of arrows and target of arrows, your smile beams eternally with tears. do not fear to suffer the heaviness, give it back to earth's weight: heavy are the mountains. heavy are the oceans. even what you planted as children, the trees, have long become too heavy; you could not carry them. but the breezes... but the spaces... psalm 91 for my sins, this for pleasure. i wish i had written it... to an english friend in africa — ben okri be grateful for the freedom to see other dreams. bless your loneliness as much as you drank of your former companionships. all that you are experiencing now, will become moods of future joys. so bless it all. do not think your way superior to another's. do not venture to judge, but see things with fresh and open eyes. do not condemn, but praise when you can, and when you can't, be silent. time now is a gift for you. a gift of freedom to think and remember and understand the ever perplexing past and to recreate yourself anew in order to transform time. live while you are alive. learn the ways of silence and wisdom. learn to act, learn a new speech. learn to be what you are in the seed of your spirit. learn to free yourself from all the things that have moulded you and which limit your secret and undiscovered road. remember that all things which happen to you are raw materials. endlessly fertile. endlessly yielding of thoughts that could change your life and go on doing so forever. never forget to pray and be thankful for all things good or bad on the rich road; for everything is changeable so long as you live while you are alive. fear not, but be full of light and love. fear not, but be alert and receptive. fear not, but act decisively when you should. fear not, but know when to stop. fear not, for you are loved by me. fear not, for death is not the real terror, but life magically is. be joyful in your silence, be strong in your patience. do not try to wrestle with the universe, but be sometimes like water or air, sometimes like fire, and constant like the earth. live slowly, think slowly, for time is a mystery. never forget that love requires always that you be the greatest person you are capable of being, self-regenerating and strong and gentle--your own hero and star. love demands the best in us. to always and in time oversome the worst and lowest in our souls. love the world wisely. it is love alone that is the greatest weapon and the deepest and hardest secret. so fear not, my friend. the darkness is gentler than you think. be grateful for the manifold, dreams of creation, and the many ways of the unnumbered peoples. be grateful for life as you live it. and may a wonderful light always guide you on the unfolding road. today it was the smell of lilacs that got me. i turned a corner, on a road i'd never walked down before, quite close to home, and bang... there i was a child of seven or eight again, dragging her feet on the way to the big houses under the railway bridge, where on some sunday mornings, a tiny lady who lived in one of them sold us rhubarb, and bunches of mint for potatoes. delicious smells...but before we got to them, we walked with our huge bundles of rhubarb along a crescent-shaped road that was full of (what i now know to be) lilacs, and the smell cleared everything else from your mind. for a while, everything...one of the saving graces of childhood. to this day i love lilac - the colour, the smell, the look of them...and of course the way they make my mouth water for rhubarb crumble. i am at a writing course this weekend, given by the legendary robert mckee — the los angeles writer of the book story. he is an amazing teacher. i did the london course 2 years ago too, and read his book (a month or so before my own book came out), but it has taken all this time to absorb what he had to say on the level it needed to be known at; i feel like i am finally mastering story, and all that instinctive way of writing is being tamed by proper plotting and structure. i am really excited that bits of the craft are finally slipping over from right to left brain; very excited... but as he says in his book, no matter how much you think you've got it sussed, you can't do it properly until you have actually done it! here's something i re-read from his book last night, and which has stayed in my head all day. it's commonplace but something that really hit home...he says, once you've mastered the rules of story and the conventions of the genre you have chosen to write in, put away the rules and "write only what you believe. write your kind of story. the kind of story you’d stand in line in the rain to buy." what fantastic advice... '...the kind of book you'd stand in line in the rain to buy." (well, actually he says "...the kind of film you'd stand in line in the rain to watch." because his course is also for screenwriters, but it's relevant for all forms. just a word of warning if anyone is thinking of going to his next course (and he does them in countries around the world)...two years ago i got lambasted by him because my phone went off during the first day of the 3 day course, when he had forbidden us to have phones on in the auditorium. he fined me £10, the total sum of money i had on me for lunch, but he made me hand it over. (to this day i swear i don't know how my phone switched on, as i'm convinced i turned it off...). i was emotionally raw because my book was about to come out, plus all that ugly stuff that was going around about me at the time, false and malicious though it all was, had finally got to me, and so the emotion his 'telling off' brought about almost knocked me for six. i wouldn't have believed it possible to feel that much over 'relatively' so little...i must have been holding all that emotion in for all that time waiting for my book to finally go public, and there in that lecture theatre i almost went into meltdown. i had shut myself down over the years, especially all those months that i was living in the car, and almost never cried anymore, about anything.... but during the 3 days of the course, i couldn't stop. i just couldn't hold back the tears, and in fact it got so bad, that on the afternoon of the last day, as we all settled down for the screening of casablanca, i had to leave. the crying was silent of course, or as much as i could make it, but it felt like a hand had passed into my chest and was squeezing my heart over and over again, big fist-sized handfuls of it, kneading it over and over like dough, and i almost couldn't see for the tears, or breathe for the pain of it. and although no one else in the lecture theatre seemed to notice (who doesn't cry at casablanca?) it felt like somehow he knew...i don't know how, but it felt like he did...and as he passed behind my seat as he briefly left the theatre for a few minutes while we continued to watch casablanca, he slowed down and seemed to look directly at me and tears were just streaming down... he must have thought i was mad...having a slight overreaction anyhow...i think he recognises me this time too. maybe i am just imagining that, but... anyhow, this year i have been smart enough to leave my phone behind — for that read, so terrified of it happening again that i didn't dare bring it along...the man's a genius, but you don't want to see his dark side...so be warned, if any of you decide to go to his next course, and i would absolutely recommend it, switch your phones off! you have been warned... i'm sitting here typing this under blue skies. the busy city street below my window is full of the smell of warm blossom and, now and then, when there is the occasional lull in traffic and all you hear is the slow swish of trees from neighbouring gardens and the call of birds in flight, you can close your eyes and think yourself almost anywhere. i love days like today. 
Male: 100%, Male, owser speed test.to learn more about the mandelbrot set, see the wikipedia article on the mandelbrot set. this holiday weekend, i decided to compose the google chrome logo using the browser's own source code. i used a combination of ruby, imagemagick, and a heavily hacked pdf library to generate this poster.this is the icon that i used:here's what it looks like zoomed in:and zoomed in some more:download the pdf in all it's vectorized glory. (approx 1.5mb. please don't link directly to the poster.)take it to your favourite print shop. since it is based on vector graphics, it can be scaled up trivially without losing quality.happy holidays!p.s. if you ask me nicely, i might send you a 24-page letter-sized split of the poster so you can print it at home. (at nearly 50mb, it's too big for me to host here.) so, i was looking a place to store some of my private data, such that i could access it conveniently when i needed to. by "conveniently", i mean over a web browser at a friend's place, or in an internet cafe.it turns out that outside of setting up an encrypted filesystem on a remote server (or doing something similarly convoluted), there really aren't any other options.the type of information that i need to store is usually of the personal kind, e.g., passport numbers, emergency contacts, financial or health information, etc. basically, i'd like to have easy access to any information that comes in handy during an emergency but can't be easily carried around.i also really wanted
Female: 100%, Female,  i'm on the train as i type heading to chicago on my way to meet up with betsy greer for programing at columbia college this afternoon. it's so easy to forget that milwaukee is only 1.5 hours away from chicago, even after 9 years of living here it slips my mind. i can't wait to catch up with betsy, i can't remember the last time we saw each other...but i think it was at the portland premier of handmade nation last spring. man a year sure goes by quick. east coast peeps tell your friends that on monday evening (march 8th) i'll be doing a screening at syracuse university in the watson auditorium at 5:15pm, free &amp; open to the public. have a good weekend everyone! i'm at my hotel in baltimore . just had a great screening at mica that was full of really great folks. tomorrow i head back to milwaukee (fingers crossed the weather stays on my side) until next thursday. in international news i just received a pdf from vida simples magazine who did an article on diy featuring the picture of knitta &amp; happy owl glassworks from handmade nation the book and also sabrina's book knit knit . and and and i got my tickets for my trip to scotland this june where i will be doing screenings and workshops in aberdeen and dundee ! i am so excited, i've never been to scotland and can not wait to soak it in. next thursday i will be on a train to chicago to the cultural studies colloquium at columbia college chicago with my friend and colleague betsy greer . the programing starts at 3:30 with a screening of handmade nation and lecture by betsy. it's free and open to the public. i'm off to slumber land, the wind here in baltimore is howling louder then hounds. quite down wind, this lady is sleepy. well, it was official before but now with a new blog , twitter, flickr and facebook fan page it's the real deal. i start shooting with my co-director sam macon the end of march for the sign painter movie . for those of you who are interested you can now download handmade nation from amazon.com i haven't tried it, but here it is: i will be hitting the road again on thursday jumping a flight west to san francisco. i am staying with the lovely lisa congdon and will be screening in oakland at rock! paper! scissor! this friday at 7pm. do pass the word on and hope to see you soon! part of my job is to stay on top of what's new and exciting going on within the creative world. i have found this to become more and more difficult as i struggle to keep up with handmade nation and the amazing opportunities that have come out of making the documentary, including the immense travel schedule that has become a part of my life. there is just so much out there, you know? so many of you are making exciting new things and documenting them in such beautiful ways. so my question is, where is the time in my day/week/month to read all of your blogs, ingest all your amazing lifestyles and inspiration? i mean, it's not like i'm out of touch at all, it's just that there is so much more than i can wrap my brain around. with this said, a few weeks ago jan from poppytalk (one of my favorite reliable blogs) got in touch as asked me to be a juror along with some other amazing ladies for her new awards she set up called " the poppies ". of course i said yes. the thing is, i often say yes to things i don't have time for but really want to do and per usual, i didn't think about the time involved with going through what ended up being 100's of links of those who were nominated for the categories. as a juror we were asked to pick 3 out of each category. each category had anywhere from 20-50 nominations. there were so many amazing things and people who i hadn't seen before, it was really difficult to stay focused while clicking through all the nominee's. i had to develop a system so i could narrow it down a bit, so i made lists for each category of my favorite picks to then pick 3 from. the entire point of this post is to share with you my lists i made. i think there was so much talent showcased for the poppies and if you want to see the jury choice winners go here. and the people's choice winners go here . below are my "working" lists from when i was in the zone of going through 100's of blogs, shops and sites. i got really inspired &amp; hope you do too. unfortunately i used my "stickies" to save my lists and they didn't save the hyperlinks, but i have linked each category to it's page so just scroll down once on each page and peep away!

you can see this feature with your's truly as well as interviews and artwork by a ton of people. there is also an amazing spread on jumping photos, which i am always a huge fan of (see below). a screen shot of my spread in blanket magazine here i am jumping on my bed in melbourne last year my time out east was fantastic. like, super tops in all manners. here is the quickest rundown possible of my 5 day jam packed trip. this is a long one.... january 15th, day #1: the show i curated " new work by merrilee challiss and margaret oomen " at craftland gallery opened. merrilee flew in from alabama and we all got to hang out. the show looks amazing, the work is stunning and i'm glad my hunch for showing those two together was correct. read more about the experience here . margaret oomen, covered sea stones margaret oomen, covered tea saucers merrilee challiss, babylon garden merrilee challiss, temple note : artwork is available for sale online here + read about margaret donating her sale proceeds to haiti on her blog here . january 16th, day #2: i got to do some putting around providence with merrilee before i dropped her at the airport before my screening later that evening. deb dormody recommended we swing by wolf e. myrow. if you are curious about a magic place filled with amazing things read more about it here . later on in the evening i had my screening at craftland, 2 sold out shows of 40! goccoed tickets by heather toupin craftland january 17th, day #3: said goodbye to providence and drove through 4 states (this blows my mind since i live in the midwest) in 2 hours to get to portland, me. i drove straight to eli phant (one of the event sponsors) to check out their store. if you get a chance go there the owners sally &amp; peter have curated an amazing shop that has all sorts of perfect handmade goodness. i can't tell you what i bought or it will ruin someone baby shower surprise.... i got a chance to finally see ferdinand in person, have some amazing tea, eat an incredible dinner then we all zipped over to space gallery for the screening. 150 people came out for the event. it was awesome. space gallery right after the screening i drove off into the night as to wake up at my friends house in belfast maine.... january 18, day #4: i have a group of friends who have decided to make belfast their home . i was there for the wedding ceremony last year and my second time back was just as amazing, just much chillier. one of the best parts of touring with my movie is i get to stay in touch with old friends, this is the perfect example. so breakfast was had then i headed over to waterfall arts for my sunday matinee. belfast, me feather, the three legged cat skunk man waterfall arts is this rad space with studios and a gallery. i was excited that 50 people came out on a gray sunday afternoon to watch handmade nation . i drove for three hours after the screening since i was due in boston the next day and there was supposed to be a big ol' snow storm. there was. january 19th, day #5: i woke up to this: lucky for me i was only an hour away from boston. i was extra super excited because i was on my way to meet up with the lovely meighan o'toole who does the art blog my love for you . meighan and i had never met, but we have had many online discussions so both of us were really excited. she was sponsoring the boston screening that was happening at 4th wall gallery that night. needless to say meighan &amp; i hit it off super hard, so hard in fact i didn't take one single picture of her since we didn't stop talking the entire time. 60+ peeps came out to 4th wall for the boston screening that night, it was awesome. 4th wall gallery january 20th, day #6 so tired from hanging out for a week straight, i had lunch with my uncle hal &amp; flew home to milwaukee. thanks everyone who came out last week. it's much appreciated. mucho much. the end. {more photos from the trip are here } first off, remember when cortney heimerl (co-author of handmade nation the book) was preggers last year and couldn't finish the last few dates of the book tour? well, check out abraham edward at his glorious 7 months and how flipping cute he is. i'm a huge fan. second, i am very much looking forward to my trip this week to providence , portland me, belfast me and boston for screenings ((details listed on the sidebar to the right)). i am super extra excited for these reasons: #1. i curated a very exciting show at craftland shop with two amazing women, merrilee challiss &amp; margaret oomen and i get to be there for the opening and merrilee will be there from birmingham, al where she lives and runs the bangin' spot bottletree . i haven't seen merrliee since she had a show at my gallery a few years ago and it is going to be fun. so, if you know anyone in providence, tell them to come to the show on thursday, all the information is here . #2. i get to hang out with deb dormody who is one of the coordinators at craftland, and also the talent behind if'n books + marks . her dude alec is also a treat to get to see. actually providence is full of magic, it's one of my favorite places in the united states. i'm so hyped for the screening on friday there. #3. i am hanging out in portland maine for the first time ever. #4. i get to go to belfast to see my friends new baby olai and do a screening at the same time. last time i was in belfast i went to this amazing wedding. #5. on monday in boston i finally get to hang out with meighan o' toole from my love for you , who organized the event there. that will be a treat. i'll do my best to update you from the road....then it will almost be february. holy crap. back to work. everything is a little backed up around here, i took some for reals time off the past two weeks. had an epic dinner party at my house, took a trip to ny and ate a whole lot of amazing food. yesterday &amp; today just sifting through emails and seeing where i left off. i'm feeling really good about this trip east coming up, so many good people to visit in boston ma, providence ri and the state of maine. i am crossing my fingers that the weather agrees with my travel plans and will update you all with new projects soon. 
Female: 100%, Female, have a little fashionista out there, like my madisen?does she give you grief every morning over what she's wearing?if you can relate, you've got to check out ... i don't know about you? but, some days it's like really that's what you want to wear to school?!how nice would it be to actually love what they've created to wear?fun, affordable &amp; as madisen puts it 'so awesome' ! still popping in from time to time, holding out hope i'll be back???your so sweet! well to fill you in on where i've been...on a whim we packed up and moved 2,000 miles away to arizona!!all on the hopes &amp; dreams of finally becoming official home owners.so, needless to say i've been a little bit busy.when and if life ever settles down, i'll be back! with lots of stories to share.until then, my email addy is on the sidebar. keep in touch, and don't forget me! back to school shopping yet? we'll if you've been in any department store lately, you've seen all the cute summer clothes being replaced with winter. i guess seeing how we've officially had no summer with all this rain, we might as well start getting ready for fall/winter.in doing so you have to check out these adorable boots!... pink ones too!!!!i told you, aren't they cute? now, how would you like a free pair? or at least 15% off?whooga is holding a giveaway for their fabulous*ugg boots!! it's going to be like the running of the brides only in a shoe store! wondering where i've been? i've been so busy fighting the terrible two's
Female: 100%, Female, i didn't even know the man in the moon was in my queue til i got it, and i can't imagine why i would have possibly added it. according to wikipedia, reese witherspoon's first movie "is notorious for a glimpse of the actress's underage, naked rear end." hah. anyway, it wasn't bad. it really made me want to move to a farm in the south. reese, who i generally like, plays 14-year-old dani trant, who falls in love with an older guy who moves in next door (played by jason london-the twin from dazed and confused and that aerosmith video, not the one from mallrats). he falls in love with her older sister, a girl who everyone spends the whole movie talking about how beautiful she is, which is kinda weird cause she has a mustache. there is lots of skinnydipping in the local pond. the dad is played by a guy from law and order i think. there is a really creepy scene where the older sister goes to a dance and gets groped by her date's father, then by her date. anyway, eventually dani finds out that the guy and her sister are sneaking around behind her back, but then jason london is killed falling off his tractor, and then the sisters forgive each other. it was a pretty decent coming-of-age type movie--the acting was good, and it wasn't overly sappy, but it was kind of boring. it has that ubiquitous teen movie scene where a tomboy type girl gets disgusted when she finds out that you kiss boys with her tongue, and then she practices on her pillow (or in this case, her hand.) at one point,
Male: 100%, Female, after finishing this, it occurred to me i had george macdonald's allegorical fairytale lilith in mind when working on it. george macdonald was a good friend of charles dodgson (lewis carroll) . the story is that of a sort of super-succubus who holds half the waters of the world in her hand. her sin is in cutting off life, which results in her living a sort of half-life and doing harm to others. george macdonald was quite an interesting character, a presbyterian minister whose unorthodox sermons (he believed in that god was internal, and in love rather than doctrine) got his parishioners riled up to the point where he was essentially demoted from a parish with a good living to a less remunerative one. it's also interesting that c.s. lewis was such an admirer of macdonald, whose vision seems to me much more generous than that of lewis.this (on imaginary bicycle) made me cry, in a good way. 
Female: 100%, Male,  serge in canada said... thank you so much for this account, however brief, of ethel. i always wondered why none of harry's letters to ethel were available. thank you. march 11, 2010 té la mà maria - reus said...explendit blog, congratulations regards from reus catalonia. thank you. march 08, 2010 joan said...bill i have just listened to the clip and i like the way the book is presented, well done and top marks again! best wishes, joan march 08, 2010 anonymous said...i had to look up “nurse child”; such a sad concept. of course, it provided an explanation in turn for connie’s place in harry and ethel’s household. thank goodness for them providing her with a loving home. the sampler is all the more special for the mistake – annie must have been concentrating hard on her stitches! february 20, 2010 anonymous said... am enjoying these stories about harry's family. i miss the blog but am so happy harry made it safe. will be checking often to see how rest of his life went on. thanks bill, this is history at its best. a loyal reader in us. february 19, 2010 anonymous said...love the blog and sad to see it coming to conclusion. can i ask what the deliberate mistake is in the sampler? i keep looking at it and not seeing it. thanks! february 19, 2010 pte harry lamin said... shall i give it away? we're too familiar with words and so don't look at them properly once our brains have decoded them. i'd guess annie got a ruler across her hand for this - or similar. bl february 20, 2010 anonymous said...ah yes, now i see it. you are correct my brain was seeing what it thought it should be seeing, not what was actually there. february 22, 2010 anonymous said...true :) but you'd be amazed how people love solving these sort of mysteries. did you say george had a middle name? i vaguely remember that but can't see it in update? could there be a lacey family connection? could the father be mr hutchinson? or have i been watching too many 'upstairs downstairs' type dramas? :) i have solved a similar situation in my own family history, it's not impossible to do so, even at a distance. i am working on others. it may be possible to find out who connie's father was much more easily - i think you noted she had a middle name that might have been the surname of her father? by the way i've really enjoyed your project and am really enjoying the updates now. thank you. march 05, 2010 i don't know of any middle name for george so that isn't much help, i'm afraid. i suppose i could ask ken, in australia, if he knows anything about his grandfather. connie's middle name was wilkinson. that may a direct link to her father. i did have an email about a mr wilkinson that sounded promising &nbsp;but, when i followed it up, got no further contact. bl colagirl said...i'm sorry to hear that the man behind the maps of harry's progress is gone. my thoughts and sympathy are with his wife and children on this unfortunate event. nevertheless, he leaves behind a contribution that has been appreciated the world over. february 11, 2010 lee said...i served with jono in the duke of wellington's regiment. i saw your comments on the dukes web site and your note on your blog. jono was my first platoon commander in 1979. i recall that no matter how cold it was, or how windy or wet, he would always strip off to the waist and have a daily wash out of his mess tin with the tiniest flannel on this planet. this he would do in full view of his troops without a shiver, if ever i felt cold or miserable, just looking up to my platoon commander made me feel safe.&nbsp; he earned our trust in him, we would have followed him to hell he was such a leader. he guided us to the champion platoon of the battalion and steered us through 2 tours of northern ireland before being promoted to captain. later he became company commander but never forgot his boys from 4 platoon, the champion platoon.&nbsp; i attach a picture for you of the platoon, jono is unmistakably sat centre front, i am 5th in on the rear rank.. he was a special leader, the sort you do not come across very often, and sadly you do not realise until it is too late. many of his 4 platoon boys went on to have fulll and varied army careers. it is only later in life after working with several platoon commanders and numorous officers that one realises how good jono was at what he did. regards ex wo2 lee greenwood, formerly, private, lance corporal, and corporal of 4 platoon led by the then lt wood&nbsp; february 07, 2010 roger o'keeffe said...how sad, and how untimely. i hadn't even registered the fact that he missed the trip, i just assumed that he was there with you, even if there was no direct reference to him in your account of it. his family must be devastated. it will be small consolation to them, but they should know that all the time that he spent contributing background material to the blog was greatly appreciated by a worldwide community. february 07, 2010 gustav's greatgranddaughter said...'maryland's' comment says it well: major woods' maps and diagrams were a wonderful addition to this blog, and greatly appreciated. our thanks to him, and condolences to his family. - february 05, 2010 rocco said...the 4 days adventure on the asiago plateau with bill following harry's footsteps were full of emotions. with jono it would have been better. while we were talking of him, wondering why he didn't answer he was already gone. a very sad story. i hope his family will deal with this hard fate february 04, 2010 maryland said...major wood's contributions to the blog were enormously helpful to me. i would like his family to know how much we readers appreciate his work. our prayers go out for those who mourn his passing. thank you, bill, for sharing the news. february 04, 2010 anonymous said...she was obviously much loved. january 29, 2010 anonymous said... nineteen years may not be much, but for connie, they were very good years. many families of the era would have 'thrown away' a 'damaged' or born-out-of-wedlock child, perhaps leaving them at an orphanage; the lamin family did not. connie was loved and cherished, by harry and ethel, kate and the young willie; if they didn't talk about her much after her death, perhaps it was from their honest grief at losing her. january 30, 2010 tricia gurnett said...it's a lovely song, and beautifully sung. thank you for the song, and the inspiring website. february 15, 2010 anonymous said...thanks for your post. this song is really fantastic. the lines are mind touching. so sweet and melodious voice. slide pictures are nice. thanks. february 05, 2010 roger o'keeffe said...schools don't always spot musical talent. cf. this extract from an interview with ken robinson, an inspiring advocate of an education that does more to let people's creativity and other gifts develop: "...i don't mean to say that you have to have failed at school before you can be a success, but an awful lot of people who did well after school didn't do well in school. paul mccartney went to school in liverpool and, as you say, he went through the whole of his education there and nobody thought he had any musical talent. one of the other people in the same (...) music class was george harrison, the lead guitarist of the beatles, and he went through school as well and nobody noticed he had any talent. so (...)one teacher in liverpool in the '50s had half the beatles in his class and he missed it." google "ken robinson ted" for more in the same vein. january 28, 2010 i rather like being compared to paul mccartney. i'm sure that's not what you meant, but i'll take it anyway. bl diane said...i have loved listening to this song and reading this blog particularly as i had an uncle who was in the 1st world war but i never knew he existed until i started doing genealogy a few years ago. unfortunately, he was invalided home before the end of the war and i have been unable to trace him after that. i was very happy and relieved to hear harry arrived home safe and sound but i'll miss the blog. thank you for all your hard work in letting us share harry's story. january 24, 2010 jo said...a lovely song which works really well with the slideshow - thank you! january 23, 2010 parkylondon said...i turned the music down as you suggested and watched the slideshow. nice. i then realised that the music i could hear wasn't coming from the bedroom (i.e. my wife listening to something) but my headphones. i picked them up, put them on and had a listen. fairly quickly i realised i nearly missed out on a really good piece of music which matches the slideshow really well. thank you for posting this. well done. january 22, 2010 tom maher said...be very proud of all of your work! following harry through civvie life would be rewarding, as we already have a good sense of the man. again - thank you! st. louis january 21, 2010 mecha said...thank you for sharing, i enjoyed it because of the lovely harmony and the fact that it told a story. january 20, 2010 kittybriton said...a lovely gentle, tender song. as much as the letters of harry, i think it catches the mood of the readers: "what'chu doing harry?". together with the video it makes the thousands of men in khaki suits a little less anonymous. january 20, 2010 alan said...very, very moving with the images from the book and blog. thanks so much for this project. although i found it a bit late, i've enjoyed following it for the last 18 months or so. january 20, 2010 avey said...excellent! i have enjoyed finding this blog and following it for the last 2 years..... thank you. january 20, 2010 cheryl said...oh, it's so wonderful! thank you for posting it! january 19, 2010 tim douglass said...well done! and a very fine way to summarize all that we have experienced vicariously through the blog. thank you! january 20, 2010 anonymous said...loved it! i am so glad harry's home but i'll be lost without the blog! january 19, 2010 inverness said...i am certainly no musician but i do know what i like..and i like this. the singer does an excellent job of bringing out the feeling and meaning of the song. thank you once again. january 19, 2010 this set of comments is the result of a delightful session with a class of french students. their resourceful teacher had asked me to answer their questions about harry and his blog, in order to practise their spoken english.&nbsp; we had a skype session with a webcam and used up a valuable and enjoyable hour. if any other school would like to repeat the exercise, don't hesitate to contact me. bl sarah, doulcet and oksana said... we are students from lycée lebrun in coutances (france) who interviewed you last friday. we want to thank you a lot for

french class who made an interview with you). thank to share this with we. january 22, 2010 marina said...mister lamin, to start, thank you for your interview. i think your project is very interesting

your blog will carry on having a lot of success. thank you very much !!!! january 22, 2010 mimi said...thank you for letting us share in harry's life through the war. it was very moving to read his personal letters. february 25, 2010 brett hagan said...this is great man i personally think you should make this into a book it would be great!!!i would definately buy it fo sho!!! february 17, 2010 he hasn't heard! bl sarah and nick said...wow, where to start. i began reading your blog after i read an article on cnn. i am currently deployed to iraq and have been keeping a journal of my day to day activities...with email and skype to keep connected to family there is no need to "write" home. the journal will help me pass my "memories" for my son and hopefully someday grandchildren to enjoy. i will be headed home in june to be with my family after a 6 month tour...i can't imagine what it would have been like for harry after 16 months without leave. he is a true hero and i thank you for your dedication to his memory. may god bless you and your family. sarah, camp victory, iraq february 07, 2010 anne said...wonderful. i do hope harry and family settled down well together. must have been a bit of adjustment for all of them. thank you so much for the blog. look forward to reading all the ''loose ends'' too. amersham. january 29, 2010 james said...i started following harry in the summer of 2007. we had sheep and a smallholding, moved to norway, had our son, have moved back to the uk. i've changed in that time. nothing in comparison to how harry and the world will have changed in the same time. i hope he manages/managaged to cope with the rest of his life. i'll be visiting the war graves at nijmegen on my way home. thanks for making me appreciate things more, realise how lucky i am january 28, 2010 vintage said...thanks for taking the time to keep the blog going like you have. january 26, 2010 g. tingey said...i agree with anonymous. what happened afterwards? what did harry do next ...... january 27, 2010 anonymous said...the man was happy to be finally home. january 27, 2010 linda h-f said... harry and bill, thank you. both of you. and all your comrades - soldiers and teachers and just plain humans - who somehow help to make us all more human by sharing glimpses into your lives. i'm planning to donate some blood in your honor, harry (i haven't much money, but perhaps that is more valuable....) and then make a trip to the san francisco, california usa wwi veterans memorial and the presidio cemetery.... as a thank you to both of you and all your contemporaries. thank you, bill, for helping this history to come alive, and to help us to share the journey with harry and his mates all these months. this is what the passing on of history really ought to be.... my parish church has a chalice donated at christmas 1919 as a prayer that there will never again be another war of this magnitude.... and i will think of &amp; pray for you both

harry arrived home safely. please let us know more about harry and his family. what happened after he returned from the war? thanks, robin in ohio january 25, 2010 ag said... just back from holiday to find that harry is home at last; squealed with glee, though now i wonder what i'll do without his semi-regular letters! (i wonder if ethel missed the letters sometimes too, and read them in odd moments? it can be so lovely to look back on such things after it's all ended happily, can't it.) thank you, thank you, thank you so much for publishing these -- for giving your faithful readers a glass through which to look back on the sacrifices of the great war, and for being such a faithful curator of these precious family documents. all the best to you and yours, and i'll raise a glass this evening in harry's memory. january 24, 2010 sgt sam avery said...hello harry: glad to hear you're finally home. long business getting back there, what? as for me, still in france and making my way to the coast at a snail pace. stop by for a read when you can. regards, sam ps. bill, i know how you must feel at the journey's end. i'm dreading it myself, except for the fact that my own book project is still in the works as a distraction from the emotion of it all being "over." best of luck with the loose ends. rich january 24, 2010 dieter finzen said...bill, thank you so much for doing this brilliant blog – besides providing great information about the individual perspective of war, your blog was the inspiration for future “historical blogs” to come. even though i have just started my own historical blog, i can tell how much effort you must have put into this unique project! all the best - you wrote internet history for sure! january 24, 2010 marcy said...when i first started reading, very soon after you started posting, i was desperate to know if harry made it home. i didn't want to go through weeks of letters to find out he died in 1917 or something. when i got the book and found he survived, i was so pleased! but i'm also glad that i went through the weeks of letters because it's been a fantastic experience. harry wasn't famous, he didn't become a politician or campaigner, he was just one of many soldiers who endured an awful event. despite his modest status, to me he really is a hero. thank you bill and thank you harry. january 22, 2010 meg's mommy said...this was an amazing blog and i have so enjoyed following harry's journey. thank you so much for all you have done. it is much appreciated. january 21, 2010 gerri patrick said... three cheers for harry and three cheers for you, bill. thank you for sharing harry's amazing story with us. january 21, 2010 anonymous said...thank you. it has been a long journey with harry and i'm very happy he got home. please let us know what happened of him: i hope he had some rest finally january 20, 2010 jason r said... an amazing journey. yes, you could not have made up a better ending. i like how short and to the point it is. thank you for posting this amazing project. doing it in real-time was a wonderful idea. january 19, 2010 pfc benjamin kaplow said... please accept my gratitude for taking us on your journey to honor your grandfather. his letters about his ww1 experiences are now a part of history for all to read. thank goodness you rescued them from that drawer where they were tucked away for so many years. a huge thank you for sharing them with so many of us throughout the world. i bet you never dreamt what your future would hold as you picked up that first letter from the drawer to read. so happy harry is home safely. thanks for the book, too. and to top it off, i can’t get harry’s song out of my head. i imagine it will become background music for the audio book. keep up the good work. my very best, florence january 17, 2010 elizabeth said...i cried! i am so glad that harry is safely home at long last. what happened next? i want know more about the family! please give us at least a potted history of the rest of harry's hopefully long life. january 17, 2010 anonymous said... as always wonderful. added to bookmarks. january 16, 2010 gloria reading said... thank you for your fine work. i've enjoyed every word. best wishes to you and your family. january 17, 2010 super bowl 44 live stream said... so sweet letter january 17, 2010 anonymous said... good post and this fill someone in on helped me alot in my college assignement. gratefulness you as your information. january 17, 2010 todd said...i, like a lot of people checked to see if there was any new letters every morning before i went to work. my feelings are torn between happiness that harry made it home safe and sadness that his story is over. i truly enjoyed following his story and will miss reading about his experiences. thank you for sharing this part of your life and legacy. todd nc, usa january 16, 2010 simon said...many thanks for the interview today. really interesting experience. january 15, 2010 simon is a member of a class of french children who are using harry's blog to practice their english. we did a "live" interview on skype when they used their english skills to question me about harry and the blog. very enjoyable. bl gillian said... thank you for publishing this blog. now to buy the book! north yorkshire, uk january 15, 2010 elhaf said...hadn't checked in in a while, and now just in time i came back. congrats to harry for making it home at last. january 15, 2010 jim said...woo hoo! harry made it through. having young kids myself i can't even begin to imagine what the release was like for him as he held his family for the first time. bill, sincerely, thank you for your investment in time and humanity through this journey. lest others forget... january 16, 2010 tim douglass said...wow! i've been following harry's story since about the second page so it is going to be a bit of a shock to the system to not have any new letters to look forward to. you are to be commended, bill, for the way you have honored harry and also all the others who fought for their countries in the great war. january 16, 2010 anonymous said..."say it ain't so." i began following the blog when i assigned it to a classroom of community college history students and while they are now long finished with the class, subsequent classes have also followed harry's journey through world war i. i can remember how excited we were to find out that he survived the war--it has been a joy and pleasure to follow along. thank you so much for all your hard work. january 15, 2010 two shorten the road said...i've really enjoyed your blog, and will miss checking in with harry's letters. january 15, 2010 sheila said...i can imagine how excited harry's family were to have him home. my earliest memory is of my father returning from world war 11. he just walked into the house. i am told that the telegram announcing his arrival was delivered the following day! although the family knew he was on his way, they didn't know which day he would come. i wonder if harry's family were in the same situation. i look forward to finding out what the future held for the lamin family. january 15, 2010 dean said...kathryn has made an excellent point...you have brought us into your family (metaphorically speaking)...we have all taken harry on as kind of a "surrogate grandfather in the war"; so i think we all hope to get a very comprehensive follow-up as to how "grandpa" made out, and how that led to the very astute and creative grandson we have also come to very fond of. dean roosevelt, toronto january 15, 2010 kathryn s said...until i found this, i'd never really seen the point of blogs! this has been brilliant and i'll miss checking up on harry's progress, not knowing what was around the corner for him. i'm looking forward to hearing how he got on with the post-war period. january 14, 2010 jim said...thanks, bill - it has been a genuine pleasure to watch harry's story unfold. really appreciate your efforts not only in telling his story but also posting the contemporary photos, maps, and the accounts of your battlefield visits. best wishes to you and the lamin family. from jim in washington state, usa. january 14, 2010 roger o'keeffe said...i'd already read the book to the end (the temptation to finish it was irresistible!), but still wanted to check in from time to time to know if he is home yet. the "here and now 90 years on" is still a powerful emotional draw. i'm feeling a strange emptiness now, an anti-climax. what must it have been like for harry and all his comrades, when they finally made it home? they must have felt pretty drained, and wondered what all the preceding years of hardship were for: was it worth it? probably nostalgia for their mates, both for those that didn't make it, and for those that did survive, but most of whom they would rarely if ever see again. most accounts indicate that the survivors rarely said much to their families about "what it was like" - both because they wanted to shelter their families from the worst and because words couldn't adequately describe it. for many years it was only among their peers that they would open up and talk about their experiences to those who could understand. a marvellous achievement, bill, and a great memorial to an ordinary chap who just did what was expected of him. and now it's time for me to head back to the somme in early 1917, just opposite the british positions on the ancre, where dieter has had a more than ample baptism of fire but still has so much to go through. january 14, 2010 roger, if you have a "strange emptiness now", &nbsp;it begins to explain the devastating feelings i'm experiencing. bl colagirl said...he's home! he's home! he's actually home! i can't believe it! i'm actually tearing up a bit as i sit here....what a wonderful, wonderful journey. thank you so much for posting this blog and letting us share harry's life experiences. i wish you (and harry) all the best...dana, illinois, usa january 14, 2010 kittybriton said...welcome home harry. i'm so glad to read that you're home at long last after all you've been through. and for standing up to the kaiser, thank you. january 15, 2010 endeavourer said...i kept "behind" with the book until late 2009 when i read to the end and was relieved to find harry's military career was soon to end. i feel privileged to haved shared in a small part of your adventure, bill, in the trip to flanders in may 2008. my granddad served in the sherwood foresters from 1916, he went 'over the top' twice, and though he survived the great war his life was badly damaged by it. he lived till my teens and harry's blog has helped me understand his personal experiences with great pride - many thanks! david january 15, 2010 william watt said...hello bill, my dad was born 10 years after harry and served in the army after immigrating to the united states in 1913 from what is now northern ireland. he never saw any action in ww i, although his brother did, but they never talked about it. i’ve followed your blog daily and very much appreciate what you have done.thanks, bill january 14, 2010 the co-ordinator said...it's been a great (true) story, everything good that blogging and the internet can bring.i look forward to your final few round-ups about the characters but then i will have a gap in my daily browsing which will be difficult to fill. january 14, 2010 kathygnome said... thank you so much for sharing these for these last few years. a wonderful tribute. january 14, 2010 dean said...i don't think you can fully appreciate how many people are much closer to their parents and grandparents because of what you have...i certainly feel much closer to my grandfather after realizing the kind of experience he also must have had. god bless...dean roosevelt, toronto january 13, 2010 thomas maher said...thank you, sir. this has been a pleasure and a privilege. st. louis january 13, 2010 anonymous said...don't stop here! i want to know what happened to him after the war - where did he find work? when were his children born, and under what circumstances? where did he die, and how? the war letters are a wonderful start; surely he had a long life ahead. january 14, 2010 anonymous said... i’m delighted harry is safely home at last, although i will miss following his story too. please do let us know how he and his family fared in the following years. i hope they were many and happy. thank you so much for sharing your family’s story and best wishes to you. january 13, 2010 felicia said... what an amazing labor of love this blog must have been for you! i'm relieved to know that harry finally made it home and will have a growing family (including an amazing grandson) to look forward to in the coming years. thank you for sharing. all the best to you. january 13, 2010 antje said... i enjoyed reading the blog quietly, never posted a comment but i am glad he has made it home safely and lived a normal and happy life after his experiences. thanks bill for sharing this. devon uk january 13, 2010 anne jones said... so glad that harry is home at last. i shall miss checking up on him, and i hope life was good to him back in england. now i can go and buy the book. i would have been too tempted to peak at the end, and i've really enjoyed reading it this way first. thank you bill. . uk january 13, 2010 bryce said...hi bill, this was a wonderful story, and i'm happy that it reached such a good conclusion for harry. like many other readers, i will be sad to see it go, and i'll certainly miss seeing new entries appear in my rss feed list from day to day. all the best to you and yours. bryce san angelo, texas january 13, 2010 marta said... what a happy letter and such a happy conclusion. i can't wait for the epilogue with what harry ended up doing, if he was able to and wanted to return to trumans or if he found some other occupation. i recall he said he never wanted to be a cook after doing so for such a long time in italy. so i'm sure he didn't do that if there wasn't an opening at his old place. thank you for providing this insight into a war often passed over very lightly in our united states school systems. why, i don't know. it was a very important period of history. my grandfather fought in this war too. i was happy to find several fiction authors devote novels and series of novels to this war and have fleshed out my understanding by reading these well researched volumes. thank you again. can't wait to read how all the loose ends of your family get tied up. pennsylvania usa january 13, 2010 felna said...i know a lot have said it all already, but thankyou again for sharing these letters. like many i've been following this blog and harry's fortunes. thank you also for directing me to dieter finzen and his blog which does the same for the other side - it has been most enlightening. january 13, 2010 i'm not sure that "the other side" applies. i get more and more to feel that all the ordinary soldiers were, sadly, actually on the same side. bl curt said... all i can say is "well done!"curt january 13, 2010 stefan said... it's like saying good bye to an old friend. strange how much i got attached to harry. and even since it's decades ago, i'm glad he's home. really strange! :-) january 13, 2010 ed quarmby said...i've followed the blog from the very beginning and never missed a post. it's been fascinating as someone interested in history and particularly the sacrifices made by ordinary people doing extraordinary things in the

[photo via le love ] to: men all over the planet from: melissa re: stupid stereotypes date: march 16, 2010 so, boys, you know how i'm always trying to drill those stupid disability misconeptions out of your beautiful minds? well, stand-up comedian ryan niemiller has actually found a better way to do it. his a guide to dating for the handicapped takes the humor route, and i couldn't have said it better myself... as someone with a handicap, i have had my fair share of troubles finding love. luckily, all of my non-handicapped friends have been so kind over the years to help me along the way, and tell me how i, someone with a handicap, should date. i've compiled, in conjunction with ally "wheels" bruener, this helpful list for anyone else here that might have a disability! i present... the guide to dating for the handicapped! -only look for others [people with disabilities]. -never try to date up. you will fail. -make yourself look as normal as possible. if someone is stupid enough, they may think you're normal. -never complain about the fact that you don't have anybody. you're handicapped and supposed to be an inspiration. don't be selfish. -everyone that hangs out with you is paid to do so. just accept it. -don't ask for anyone to set you up. no one is going to be that mean to their friends. -if you are disabled, you must be asexual. -if you really want a date, try getting it setup through the make-a-wish foundation. it's your best bet. -just accept the fact that a pat on the head from a little old man will be the most action you'll see. -take some classes on counseling: you'll be the one everyone comes to with their problems. -if anyone actually offers to sleep with you, decline. it is a fraternity/sorority initiation prank. or your parents paid them. -if you don't want to die a virgin, begin shopping around for the best-priced hooker immediately. -never let your quest for a relationship get out to your family: they'll reassure that it just isn't practical. -your non-handicapped friends are right - you're just being silly. -society isn't as harsh as you think. you're just being overly critical. -every member of the opposite sex you talk to will tell you there is someone out there for you - it's just not them. -you just aren't trying hard enough. -you're trying too hard. just let it happen. -you want a family? don't these supposed rules society buys into just look completely ridiculous and ignorant when seen on paper (well, on the screen) and listed all together? don't they want to make you scratch your eyes out? because you know i have a big mouth, allow me to add a couple of my own to round out the list... -always have your date talk for you, cut your meat for you and tell people to move out of the way as you're coming through. because, you know, you can't use your voice in public. don't want to scare the little children, do you? -if the most action you ever get is looking into the gorgeous blue eyes of silvio every time he comes to help you shower, be grateful. silvio is your in-home health-care worker. -you're loved by your family. that's more than what some people have. don't cry with a loaf of bread under your arm. let me know, boys, when those guilty, oh-my-gosh-i-can't-believe-i-let-her-get-away feelings set in. go ahead, boys. i'll wait. heck, i've got all day - and night...you know, because it's not like i have a date or anything. xoxo [photos via happythings ] i love the meaning behind these travel-themed engagement photo shoots. these couples look so happy and excited to be starting a new adventure in marriage, don't they? xoxo p.s. the map shoot is my favorite! too bad there's not really a map of love somewhere out there! and the plane shoot makes me want to burst into my own rendition of up where we belong . sigh. p.p.s. check out beau-coup's wedding blog for more awww-inspiring couples! the wonderfully insightful kasey is back to share more tales with us this week (read his previous tales here + here ). and just so you know readers, these are in no way solicited by me, but i will say i'm loving his style, aren't you? xoxo rule #11 put your money where your mouth is. guys, if you like a girl, you need either to pay or offer to pay for the evening. period. ladies, if you like a guy and you’ve been on a few dates, (and you’re not going to dump him), offer to pay every now and then. i typically refuse to let girls pay if i like them. but i love it when they ask. and if the ladies want to pay for their own, that is fine too. if a guy does not offer to pay, it is usually safe to assume that he isn’t that into you. if a girl wants to pay her own way, guys, let her. actually, guys, let her do whatever she wants. don’t screw it up. but at least offer to pay. you are not trying to buy your date, or buy sex, or any of those ludicrous ideas. you are simply saying, “i like you,” and proving it by how you handle your money. rule #22 always call with a plan. recently, a girl friend of mine received a call (from a guy who supposedly likes her) where his only question was, “can i call you tomorrow to see when you’re free?” let this sink in. read it again.... exactly. dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb. he had her on the phone already...wouldn’t it make sense to just ask her when she was free? yes. people are actually this silly. anyway, the point is, always call with a plan. even if the plan is just to talk about the other person’s day. that counts, because you’re talking, building communication skills, and (hopefully) getting to know more about the other person’s likes and dislikes (so you can pull out that information when it really counts). guys, unless it is too late to go do something, you always need to have a plan that puts the two of you together. suggestions include movies, dinner, walks in the park, heck, you can even walk around wal-mart and do some grocery shopping! i like asking girls if they would like to play with my wii. oddly enough, they like it!!! :) it is ok if the girl wants to change the plan. just make sure you have thought of something. especially avoid this exchange: “what do you want to do?” “i don’t know, what do you want to do?” “i don’t know...maybe...well....what do you want to do?” no, no, no! if all else fails, say, “i want to see you!!” that, at least, is the truth. [photos via we heart it ] prologue : you know your nonexistent love life has become close to extinction territory when your own mother makes you feel as though it's the most ludicrioous idea in the world that you could possibly be interested in or even have a chance with a romantic beau. i had another one of those invisibility moments last week. you know the kind, friends...where you're just standing there and wishing you had a white flag that you could wave wildly in the air and scream, " hello, i'm right here, aren't i? why can't you see me? and yet, even though i was there, i felt completely invisible. and what made me feel even worse was that the person whom i felt invisible toward wasn't some guy or some guy's girlfriend or even mr. hefner himself. it was my mother. here's how the situation went down: i got a sweet email from cute guy friend on the anniversary of my dad's death last week. he wrote to say that he was thinking of my family and remembering my dad. how sweet is that? well, as my awkward (and awful...) luck would have it, things turned pretty sour, pretty quickly when i casually brought it up to my mother later that day. "oh, that's sweet," she replied, and then immediately turned to my sister and said, "you should date him..." my sister? really? i mean...really? i just sat there floored, and quite a bit deflated. a few minutes later, during which time my mother had probably forgotten what she'd said in the first place, i said flat-out, "why didn't you say that to me?" "you've never expressed an interest in him," she replied, as if my question was the dumbest thing she'd ever heard. newsflash: neither has my sister. she's never expressed an interest in him. not even once. so let's review the facts, shall we, friends? -he emailed me -my sister hardly knows him i suppose it bothered me even more because this isn't the first time my mother has bypassed me completely, which is why i've always looked at my sister as the pretty one. i know, it's being overly sensitive probably on my part, and my mother probably wasn't even thinking about my disability when she made that remark. in the last few months, i've been feeling increasingly confident as a sexy woman with a disability ( ok, gosh, just typing the word sexy to describe myself just made me blush, literally... ), and i suppose this harmless comment brought some of those invisibility, wallflower feelings back. even if just a little bit, you know? is it impossible for my mother - or anyone, really - to think that i could be capable of being in a relationship? has that concept just never even dawned on her? am i not worthy of that just as much as anyone else? i know she doesn't do it consciously, but sometimes, i swear my mother is incapable of seeing me as a woman, and yes, i'm aware that this is a common theme among mothers. but it just seems so much more pronounced in my life, especially when you add the disability factor to it. or maybe, at the end of the day, i'm just being overly sensitive. maybe i'm projecting my own insecurities and using them as a lens by which to judge things. let's be honest, friends: it's not like i haven't done that sort of thing before. but you know what, damnit? it bothered me. it hurt me. it eroded just a little of the disability self-esteem that had been slowly growing like a flower. well, now the flower looks as if it's beginning to wilt. what do you think, friends? am i just being overly neurotic once again? xoxo [photos via happythings ] routines...my gosh, they can be hard to get back into, can't they, friends? i'm back at work today and am trying to get back into the swing of things. may these calming photos inspire me - and you! xoxo [photos via flickr ] happy monday, friends! i was going over the man candy archives over the weekend, and i had to gasp when i realized i haven't featured this guy yet. well, he's more of a man than a guy, and let's just say that he's only gotten better with age. he showed us a new life of living on a prayer and always promised to lay us down in a bed of roses. and as she's aged, he's up the sexy-wow factor by declaring "it's my life" and reminding us that, yes, we can go home again... jon bon jovi!!!!!!!!!! happy friday, friends! how was your week?

Male: 100%, Female, longtime fsp readers know that i am interested in how academia is depicted in literature and other artistic venues, and that i have a particular interest in academic satire in novels . although i generally disapprove of attempts to make academia and academics seem like bizarre, megalomaniacal control freaks who are entirely disconnected from the "real" world, i am not incapable of enjoying a good academic satire (hence my fondness of the novel straight man , by richard russo). i even like the indigo girls' song, "closer to fine", despite this horrific set of anti-academic lyrics: i went to see the doctor of philosophy with a poster of rasputin and a beard down to his knee. he never did marry, or see a b-grade movie he graded my performance he said he could see through me. i spent four years prostrate to the higher mind, got my paper and i was free. give me a break. anyway, i was curious to read the recent novel "36 arguments for the existence of god" ( rebecca goldstein ), described in some reviews as a brilliant new example in the academic satire genre. washington post (ron charles): the field of academic satire is crowded with such classics as "lucky jim" and "straight man," but "36 arguments" sports so many spot-on episodes of cerebral pomposity that you've got to place this novel among the very funniest ever written. new york times (janet maslin ): when cass witnesses a powerpoint presentation featuring “brain scans of sophomores, neuroimaged in the throes of moral deliberation over whether they should, in theory, toss a hapless fat man onto the tracks in order to use his bulk to save five other men from an oncoming trolley,” this book occupies its ideal vantage point: close to the absurdity of current academic thinking yet just far enough away to laugh. cerebral pomposity? the absurdity of current academic thinking? did these reviewers also spend their college years prostrate to bearded, rasputin-loving higher minds? certainly there are pompous intellectuals in academia, and some research topics and methods seem quite absurd , but these are not the kinds of things i enjoy seeing parodied in novels and pilloried in reviews. for me, the most clever and entertaining academic novels are the ones that show the absurdity of the weird-but- mundane rituals of academic life (professor-student interactions, faculty meetings, budgets, tenure) and that are a bit more subtle in their portrayal of classic personalities in academe. therefore, i am not particularly impressed by bizarre and disturbing characters such as the "extreme distinguished professor" in 36 arguments , and am much more entertained by a depiction of strangely recognizable people embroiled in the bizarre and disturbing rituals of a faculty search (as in straight man ). said fsp's daughter's middle school science teacher to fsp when he saw her in the corridor of the school: hey, it's the famous woman scientist. i was taken aback at first, wondering why he used adjectives, one of which was strange and the other implied that scientist = man unless you specify otherwise (hence the somewhat cynical name for this blog). but then i figured out why he greeted me that way. later, this same science teacher asked me if i would come talk to his class in a month or two. great! i replied. but i thought you were done with the unit on my science. oh.. ah.. yes. actually, we are doing a unit on diversity and so we need a .. a .. a.. woman scientist? yes, exactly. the state expects us to do something on diversity and i uh.. uh.. have no clue what to do and don't even know enough to ask this favor in a non-offensive way? i didn't say that, but, actually, i don't have a clue either. i have never talked about diversity to a group of middle school kids before. i assume that i should talk about all types of diversity, not gender. i would like to keep my overall message positive and talk about science as a rewarding career, but perhaps we could also discuss stereotypes of scientists (strange white males). i'm going to have to give this a lot more thought. has anyone else given a talk on diversity to middle schoolers? i could use some advice. as both a student and a professor, i have experienced at various times both the us quarter and semester systems. for those unfamiliar with these systems: an academic year composed of quarters involves 3 academic terms (+ a summer term = 4 quarters), each of 10 weeks duration (fall, winter, spring). an academic year composed of semesters involves 2 terms, each ~15 (±) weeks duration (fall and "spring", the former of which may include the end of summer and the latter of which includes the winter season). some of my colleagues and students experience the "block plan" (1 intensive course per 3 week period), but i have not, so i will confine my comments to quarters v. semesters. both quarter and semester systems have advantages and disadvantages for professors and students, but these pros and cons may shift around from course to course depending on various factors related to course content and professorial teaching ability. quarter system: terms are shorter. boring classes are over sooner, and boring professors can inflict less damage. the content and format of some courses, even very enthralling ones, are better suited to a shorter term. quarters typically start later (september in the us) and end later (june) than the semester-based academic year. you may like or dislike quarters owing to this feature; alternatively, you may like this feature in late august and early september (when your semester colleagues have started their academic year) and hate it in may and early june (when your semester colleagues already have their grades done). it may be easier for professor to get a research leave for a quarter than it is to get a semester leave. students on the quarter system may be at a disadvantage in the summer because their academic year ends late relative to the start of some summer internships and other jobs. semester system : semesters can seem very, very long. your joy at making it to spring break may be a bit dampened by the realization that the semester is only half over. you can, however, explore more topics in more depth than you can with a shorter term. you may have more flexibility in course content, owing to the longer term. you get to know your students better. you might even learn all their names. you may start the academic year before you are ready for summer to end, but you are done in the spring. depending on your institutions policies re. teaching load, you may have fewer course preps/year. you only have to deal with beginning and end of semester craziness twice instead of 3 times. in an academic term, the first couple of weeks and the last week or two can be quite chaotic, but in a semester, there is plenty of time in the middle to get into a routine in which the logistics of the course are at least functioning well. as a student, i didn't have a strong preference, even once i had experienced both systems. depending on how many courses i was expected to take at once and what the course offerings were, i may have had a slight preference for one over the other, but overall it didn't matter a lot to me. as a professor, i think i prefer the quarter system, recognizing that semesters do have some distinct advantages. for most courses, i feel that i can convey the most essential information in 10 weeks. i wouldn't like quarters if i had to create new courses all the time, but for a relatively stable set of courses and only the occasional new course to prepare, quarters are better for maintaining a high energy level and morale from term start to term end. which do you like? semesters or quarters or something else? some applications for open faculty positions require letters of recommendation up-front; some request letters only after there has been a first stage of selection based on other information supplied by the applicant. although i don't mind the first method, i prefer the second because it seems like a better use of time for those writing the letters and for those reading the applications. i know that things are done in a different way at many non-us institutions, but lately i have encountered variations on this system within the us. in the past few months: - i received a request for a letter of reference for someone who had already been invited to interview at a us institution. in fact, no letters of reference were solicited until this stage, so my letter wasn't supplementary or an attempt to fill a reference letter quota. the letters were clearly not a part of the interview selection decision. it is unclear what role, if any, they have in the search. and - i received a request for a letter of reference after someone had a phone interview but before they were invited for the actual interview . i am glad i am not on that hiring committee, as it seems to involve several extra steps. i didn't mind either of those requests, although the first case made me wonder why the institution even bothered to get letters if they are so unimportant in the process. perhaps it is an administrative requirement? having read thousands of these letters, i must say i can't really blame anyone for not valuing reference letters very much. a letter request that did annoy me, however, was one accompanied by the information that my letter would not even be read unless the candidate advanced to the final interview stage. in this case, the position is not an academic one, so perhaps i just lack familiarity with how things are done outside academia. from what i could tell from the instructions, the organization will not read the letters before the final candidates are selected from a huge pool of applicants but wants to have the letters on hand to read as soon as the final interviewees are selected, and hence the request for possibly superfluous letters. i can understand the wish for efficiency, especially given the large number of applicants, but it is a bit of a strange request: please write this letter even though we are unlikely to read it. we need to be efficient but we are willing to (possibly) waste your time. wouldn't such a request lend itself to getting cursory letters or letters that are not focused specifically on the position for which the applicant has applied? i typically take some time to customize each letter depending on what the position is, and in some cases this takes quite a bit of time. why would i do that if i don't know if my letter will even be read? i guess i will do it for the same reason we write any reference letters, not knowing if the subject of the letters will get the position. despite knowing in this particular case that my letter may be transferred, unread, directly to an electronic trash heap, i think the best strategy is to try to forget about that and write the letter in the hopes that it will eventually be read, the student will get the job, and it will all be worthwhile in the end. a reader asks: how long do you typically give 1st or 2nd year grad students to "pull things together" when they struggle in the beginning? where is the line is drawn and what factors affect the judgments professors will make about their students? i will consider only phd students in this discussion. i should say right away that i do not have a foolproof way of deciding when or where to draw the line on struggling students. i tend to err on the side of delusional optimism, hoping that some solution involving change in project (topics, methods), degree of supervision (more structure, specific goal-setting), or approach to writing will pull us all through the problems. only in hindsight has it been obvious when this was a bad plan, resulting in prolonged suffering and expense. in other cases, it has worked; by "worked" i mean that the student got their phd and therefore any difficulties were worth it, i think. that said, when and where i draw the line depends on the specific things with which the student is struggling and how (or whether) they are making an effort to communicate about and/or deal with the problem(s). is the problem motivation? if a student is unproductive owing to a severe lack of interest or motivation in any reasonable research project they can do with me as adviser, that is something that should be quite clear in the second year, if not the first. (though i have had students who started out very energetic in the first year but whose motivation was completely extinguished in the second by the reality of what research and/or working with me involves) is the problem that the student lacks the information or skills necessary to do the research? that can be fixed in many cases, and should be dealt with by the end of the second year. the student should be as proactive as possible about learning what they need to know to do their research. is the problem the adviser? is this something that could be fixed by discussing the situation or is it something that can't be changed? if the latter, the student has a decision to make about whether to continue with that adviser. although it is possible that, with time, the student may understand better what seems like irrational or unkind behavior, it is likely that the adviser won't become more sane or nice with time. is the problem beyond the student's control? examples: access to facilities? a complex and difficult research project that may proceed in a non-linear way? lack of clear direction? research that takes a long time to produce interpretable results? i am impressed by students who find ways to deal with obstacles like these. in fact, a student who feels like they are struggling, perhaps because they are too critical when comparing themselves with others, may not be struggling in the eyes of the adviser and other faculty. other problems, such as those involving finishing a project or writing, may not manifest themselves until later (after the first two years). in the first two years, it is not too late to change course in a possibly dramatic way, including deciding that there is no point in continuing in the graduate program. there have been a few cases in which i decided in the first or second year that there was no point in advising a student for a phd; these students got an ms instead. there has to be an obvious, major reason for going this route, though -- e.g., failed classes or lack of productivity owing to extreme lack of effort. will a student who has a slow (but not catastrophic) first year or two be at a permanent disadvantage? i suppose this depends on the adviser, but in my opinion, a student who struggles with something in the first year or two, but who eventually surmounts the obstacles and succeeds, should not be at a disadvantage later. in fact, few arrive in graduate school perfectly prepared to leap into the perfect project that goes perfectly from day one. if you had asked any of my graduate advisers or committee members what they thought of me in my first or second years of graduate school, the responses would have ranged from a derisive snort to a polite but sympathetic chuckle at my likely future career as a cat sitter. that changed a few years later once i started getting results and writing papers, and my slow start didn't harm my career. if you (mostly) like what you are doing, and at times possibly even love what you are doing, and you want to keep going with your research, despite initial problems, my advice, summarized, is: stay focused, know what your goals are (short-range, intermediate-range, long-range), communicate with your adviser and others, if you feel stuck at least make some progress step-by-step (even if the steps seem small), and don't worry so much. the chronicle review (the magazine-like part of the chronicle of higher education ) recently asked a group of "scholars and experts" to comment on stress in the lives of academics, using the amy bishop incident as a springboard for the discussion; i.e., what role might stress related to the tenure process have played in this tragedy? the scholars and experts included: a writer and phd candidate in english literature the chancellor of the pennsylvania state system of higher education a professor of international politics a professor of english an assistant professor of public policy and political science an assistant professor of sociology and women's and gender studies a phd candidate in anthropology a dean of a school of arts &amp; sciences a professor of management a professor of history clearly there was an effort to consult a wide variety of academics associated with the us system of higher education: professors and administrators, tenured professors and tenure-track professors, professors at universities and professors at small liberal arts colleges, even some phd candidates who have no direct experience (yet) with the stresses of being on the tenure-track. many of these people had thoughtful insights; i was interested to know the opinions of sociologists and anthropologists and others. even so, amy bishop was an assistant professor of biology. does it seem odd to anyone else that there were no biology or other science professors in this particular group of academics commenting on the incident? i looked up the chancellor and the dean and learned that their field of expertise is psychology, so perhaps they come the closest, but that's not the same as getting the opinion of someone who has recently experienced the tenure process as a scientist. i realize that a biology professor would not necessarily have any more insight into the general implications of the incident than those who provided comments in this piece in the chronicle . and i still stand by my overall view (shared by the phd candidate in english literature) that the murders were the actions of an imbalanced person with a rage problem (and a gun), and the tragedy was therefore not a direct result of the stresses of academia in general or the tenure evaluation system in particular. still, i think it is strange that in an otherwise diverse group, not one is a science professor with direct knowledge of what it is like to get tenure as a scientist today at a university. consider how bizarre it would have been if an english professor (for example) had committed a heinous crime that may or may not have been related to the experience of being an english professor, and the only people asked to comment (in a particular series of essays) were science, engineering, and math professors. i also think it would have been illuminating to read, for comparison, the thoughts of a scientist recently denied tenure. with all due respect to the phd candidates and literary scholars who wrote thoughtful essays for the piece, surely the chronicle could have found some current or former science professors -- ideally in the life sciences -- to comment? i don't want to perpetuate an "us" (scientists) vs. "them (non-scientists) mentality, but often when i read about academia, in the chronicle and elsewhere, the point of view of non-scientists is the only one represented. this gives a very incomplete view of academia and the lives of academics, in general and in extreme cases. although we have much in common as researchers and educators, there are also significant differences that, at times, merit consideration. who is staying away from campus for spring break by choice (i.e., not owing to a furlough)? who is doing this because otherwise they will have a dire childcare challenge? who is staying away from campus for a week as a sanity break so that they can face the rest of the academic year with renewed energy? of those avoiding campus: will you be going somewhere (preferably fun and interesting) or just staying home (and possibly working there)? who will be on campus but would rather not be there? who will be on campus because if they don't, they fear the consequences (from their adviser, from their advisees , from a promotion &amp; tenure committee, from collaborators)? if you are a graduate student, has your adviser specifically discussed with you whether you can/should/will work over spring break? if so, what did they say? if not, what do you think they would say? and who is going to be on campus because they want to be there -- to enjoy a week of relative quiet in their office, catch up on research, get ready for post-break classes, and possibly even clean their desk and its immediate surroundings?

(grad students) off campus but working off campus and not working on campus and working (but would rather not be) on campus and working (happily!) pollcode .com free polls many times i have conversed with a visitor who is much more famous and smarter than i am. we sit in my office and we/i try to find something of mutual interest that we can discuss. i am not a skilled conversationalist, but i can almost always find something to talk about for half an hour. one of the things i am not tempted to discuss is the disparity in success or fame or iq or amount of funding of whatever between the visitor and me. what would be the point of that? it is therefore disconcerting for me when i find myself in the visitor's chair in someone else's office and they start the conversation with a series of self-deprecating statements about how they have not published as much as i have, and how i write better proposals than they do, and how they are basically not as successful as i am. this does not happen often, but it happens from time to time. i hasten to note that this is not because i am so awesomely famous or well funded. my usual description of myself is "reasonably successful" as a scientist, and i think that is accurate. i do not think the self-deprecation is a form of false modesty. the self-deprecating person is genuinely ripped up about their lack of productivity. i think these conversations stem more from insecurities than from anything specific about me or my career. even so, what i am supposed to say when confronted with these types of statements? i am more than willing to have a conversation about proposal strategies or ideas for new directions in research, or even to have a group wallow about some aspect of science or academia that is particularly controversial or nerve-wracking. if the self-deprecating person is a stressed out early career professor, i can go into mentor mode, if that seems to be a useful way to go. otherwise, i try to steer the conversations to research-related topics that might be of mutual interest, or i ask a lot of questions. it is possible that some "successful" visitors will want to tell you how amazing they (think they) are, but in the absence of such a conversational foray, here is a gentle request to those scheduled for an individual meeting with a visiting speaker: even if you feel that you are orders of magnitude less successful than your visitor in some professional capacity, even if you have the most raging case of impostor syndrome, even if you are in awe of the towering intellect of your distinguished visitor, and even if you can think of nothing more fabulous than being a short, unprepossessing middle-aged female science professor like your visitor, please tuck away these feelings and talk about science or students or something else other than your (relative) lack of success. some visitor's egos may need continual care and stoking, but i think you will feel better, and everyone will have a more interesting half hour, if self-deprecation, whatever the reason for it, is not a major feature of the conversation.

of people i might not have encountered otherwise.&#160; a short while ago, i received a couple of comments from a friendly blogger called “revivor” and when i popped over to his blog, i saw that he was organising a four day run from clapham to brighton to raise money for the charity caspa (children on the autistic spectrum parents’ association) .&#160; naturally i was intrigued and so i contacted him straight away and we decided to meet up and chat about his noble adventure. ivor reveley (check out the “gotta run” t-shirt) on whether he has done such a thing before… two years ago, on his fiftieth birthday, ivor and a team of runners ran from romford to orpington.&#160; they ran 50kms over 50 hours to raise money for 50 young people with autism.&#160; ivor broke that down for me and explained that it is not as impossible as it sounds (bearing in mind that i walk a 5km fun run once a year): you run for two to three hours a day over three days and cover about 20 kilometres a day.&#160; it is not easy but it is possible! they raised £8,500 on that occasion which meant that their charity caspa was able to obtain viability and get the real start that it required.&#160; this is so important, as ivor explains, because it meant that the charity could remain a stable entity in the lives of the children and families it serves. on why he was raising money for caspa? ivor's sixteen-year-old son has autism.&#160; after being a charity trustee for fifteen to twenty years, ivor realised that he had the skill necessary to make a difference in the lives of other children with autism and he decided to get involved with caspa. on what caspa is and what they do... ivor is the chair and trustee of the charity.&#160; they started off as an informal parents’ association in 2002 and formally registered the charity in 2005.&#160; as a charity, they run events and workshops for young people with autism such as: brighton beach kid’s days out youth club on a friday night a residential week long summer camp independent living workshops (which are sponsored by the lda ) they have received brilliant feedback from the children who say it is a safe environment for them to have fun, free from bullying or other such concerns. on making the runs interesting… after completing a-levels in economics, geography and maths, ivor went on to study economics at university. an avid map lover, ivor is now using his geography and maths skills again as he plans the most historical and geographically interesting routes through cathedrals and up high streets.&#160; the idea is for the runners to enjoy these events and to see and learn about the places they run through. on this year’s event… date: 30 april – 3 may 2010. route: clapham common to brighton beach ( route details ) ivor hopes to do events like this every even year and this year they will be doing a four day run from clapham to brighton.&#160; ivor is keeping a log of all of the training and organising of the event in his blog four days running . a half marathon is 21km and these runners will be doing more than that each day as they will run from about 2.30pm to 5pm every day for four days. friends, family and supporters will be able to meet up with the runners every evening as pub nights are being organised on facebook and the hotels that the group is staying in is published on the site ( stay on route ). this is not a public run but anyone interested in joining the run can contact ivor at the site to get involved.&#160; they have a photographer taking part this year so expect great photos! on how you can help… you can donate money using the button above.&#160; that will take you to the just giving site where the money will go straight to the charity and won’t touch anyone’s hands. but don’t worry, there are lots of other ways to help too: follow the four days running blog follow ivor’s twitter account: @revivor .&#160; join the fun and do the four day run: run with us stay on the route

fine (read: really rather expensive) dining in britain. barely a day goes by when we don’t hear of someone’s tales of woe with regards to their finances. maybe nary a day goes by when you don’t think of your own tales of personal finance horror, but this post isn’t about personal finances, in fact, this post isn’t even going to be particularly serious in the slightest, perhaps a welcome break from the drudgery we encounter on a day-to-day basis. this post is for those who dare to dream, who occasionally – or often, there’s no discrimination at play here – have flights of fancy where they can afford whatever they please, consequences be damned. food. everyone loves food. of course, there are picky eaters, gluttons who eat anything and then there’s the gourmet, who will indulge in only the finest of fripperies wherever food is concerned. you’ve probably guessed where this is going and it’s headed in a direction in which the subject matter will revolve around the finest/most expensive eating establishments in britain, avoiding the cliché that is the “world’s most expensive” and instead opting for the lower-key “just in britain” subtitle, so maybe you’ll want to bear these in mind next time you’re booking any flights to london . there are no diamonds in food, gemstones on cutlery-related shenanigans here, for these places are expensive because…well…they just are. london, restaurant gordon ramsay also one of the single most expensive restaurants in the world, this place can set you back at least £120 for a single person and that’s just selecting from the average stuff. if you were to opt for more exquisite dishes and then a bottle or wine or so, well, then you’re looking at a hefty price-tag indeed! a favorite amongst locals and tourists alike (provided that can afford it, of course), the restaurant itself is known for serving up the most palate-pleasing dishes in the whole of england’s fine capital city. typical delights on offer might include cornish lamb, pork belly and the finest angus beef, all mixed in with a wide range of other fine accoutrements. by the time you were done with this place, you’d certainly be in a better position to understand the reason behind the three michelin stars that have been awarded to it. however, your wallet might not be! berkshire, waterside inn put on the proverbial map thanks to fantastic food, a three-star michelin chef in the form of owner michel roux and a £24 plum soufflé that made it onto the forbes list of the world’s most expensive desserts (it came tenth), the waterside inn is not only a dive into opulence, but also a dive into quality as those stars aren’t awards to just anyone that comes along. with “inn” in the title, you’d be correct in suspecting that the building housing the restaurant also serves as a place where you can – for a modest sum – spend a few nights. the restaurant’s chefs serve the whole gamut of dishes you’d expect: lobster, rabbit, lamb, duck, turbot and many others, each served as decadently and in an adept a fashion as you’d imagine. truly an experience for the rich in taste as well as the rich in wealth, as you will most likely be set back around £100+ for a two-course meal. london, sketch back to the nation’s capital again, for meals that again breach the £100 mark. sketch has long been touted as an incredibly expensive place to eat, hence the gaggle of celebrities and other people of note that occasionally dine at the establishment. however, the price doesn’t belie the quality and instead is more of an indication of it, what with the restaurant itself being a product of algerian restaurateur mourad mazouz and celebrated french chef pierre gagnaire, you can rest assured that the place will contain nothing less than the most sumptuous of everything the culinary realm has to offer. for more travel tips and vacation inspiration, check out the tripbase travel blog / tripbase site. about tripbase : tripbase eliminates the

we went to see the garrick theatre production of douglas carter beane’s the little dog laughed. the little dog laughed is about a rising hollywood star mitchell (rupert friend) who in the words of his agent “suffers from a slight recurring case of homosexuality”.&#160; he meets rent boy alex (harry lloyd) and their lives are turned somewhat upside down when they both fall for each other despite both asserting that they are not gay.&#160; the play is set against the backdrop of hollywood and homosexuality and explores all of the double standards and difficulties with coming out in show business.&#160; there is a fantastic quote by colin firth in the programme which just about sums it up: “if you’re a straight actor who takes on the role of a gay man, it’s obviously not the same as being one in this business”. the little dog laughed was written by douglas carter beane who also wrote to wong foo, thanks for everything! julie newmar , a 1995 film starring patrick swayze and wesley snapes.&#160; it first opened off-broadway at the second stage theatre in 2006.&#160; the play is narrated by mitchell’s morally challenged agent diane (played by tamsin greig) who has such classic lines as &quot;a writer with the final cut? i'd rather give firearms to small children”.&#160; it is no secret really that i am a massive fan of harry lloyd and have spent the past three years watching each and every one of his plays but it is greig who absolutely steals the show and her acting, wardrobe and personality all fit the role perfectly.&#160; in her role as diane, greig superbly breaks through the fourth wall, allowing the audience into the world of hollywood agents, actors and writers and she did it very well indeed.&#160; she was incredibly comfortable chatting and winking to the audience one minute and then diving right back into her encounters with the rest of the cast the next. rupert friend plays the drunken, privileged and somewhat sheltered mitchell really well.&#160; while i tend not to question how characters were written (as it is generally a fixed factor when putting on a play), i have to wonder at a rising hollywood star who doesn’t get the significance of coming out to the world and the effect that could have on his career.&#160; in the end, his naiveté is what trips him up though. in an equal sense, harry lloyd’s alex just doesn’t seem to understand the dynamic of his relationship with his girl pal ellen (played by gemma arterton) and the effect that his growing relationship with mitchell will have on her.&#160; he does, however, utter my favourite line of the play while trying to get a point across to mitchell: “god, talking to you is like sewing a button on cottage cheese”. as far as rather shallow, clueless roles go, friend and lloyd do as well as they can do but they have both taken on much better roles in the past.&#160; the one thing they do both handle extremely well is the intimacy and affection that develops between their two characters.&#160; there is a fair bit of nudity in the play (with harry lloyd being fully nude at one point) and both actors were professional and convincing in their roles. gemma arterton was far less convincing and you got the idea that she was trying to inflate her supporting role somewhat as the character definitely shrinks in comparison to the other three.&#160; she seemed to posture a lot and to shout her lines rather than speak them with meaning and emotion.&#160; she is quite inexperienced in theatre though and this certainly didn’t ruin the play.&#160; you have to wonder though if those in casting didn’t foresee that she would be completely overshadowed by greig (or perhaps that was the point?) this production of the little dog laughed was directed by jamie lloyd and i must say he made good use of the space and actors.&#160; there is one invisible character, so to speak, who appears in one scene and speaks on the phone but is not played by anyone.&#160; i thought this was really well portrayed by the cast and well managed by the director. the set was designed by soutra gilmour who received an olivier award nomination for best set design in 2009.&#160; while gilmour’s sets are often dark and almost sinister, this was stark, bare and completely white but the minimalist set worked in this play.&#160; the play itself is incredibly funny and highly entertaining.&#160; it doesn’t provide any grand answers to the problems it identifies but seems to focus more on the situation at hand and how that plays out.&#160; the audience was laughing along raucously at the numerous one-liners and there was much enthusiastic clapping and cheers of “bravo!” at the end.&#160; all in all it was a fun night out and i’d certainly recommend the play for people seeking a light-hearted comedy experience. the little dog laughed is playing at the garrick theatre until 10 april 2010.&#160; there are really good prices available on tickets at lastminute.com and we got tickets for £29.50 each from westendtheatre.com . watch the little dog laughed trailer: if you are reading this anywhere besides emm in london or in an rss reader then the

the uk.&#160; each year they showcase some of the biggest up and coming indie alternative bands in the run up to the nme awards.&#160; this year the maccabees, bombay bicycle club, the big pink and the drums hit the road on a nationwide tour and i caught them at the brixton academy in london. the drums the drums are a post-punk band hailing from brooklyn, new york and it is likely that you would recognise their song “let’s go surfing”.&#160; they are currently on a sold out tour of uk, ireland and mainland europe and will be supporting florence and the machine on their nationwide tour starting in may. the drums have a sound reminiscent of the punk and ska bands of the early eighties but i found them to be pretty average and unoriginal. i had not even heard of them before the night but certainly won’t be rushing off to buy any of their albums.&#160; most importantly, i have never seen a bunch of people look so uncomfortable on a stage before.&#160; i’ve seen cheesy robotic dancing before and singers playing air drums but it is clear that the drums have a long way to go as a band before they make that look cool. &#160; the big pink the big pink are the reason we went to the shockwaves nme awards tour this year and it is safe to say that i am a massive fan of their album a brief history of love which i reviewed on blogcritics in january.&#160; the big pink arrived on stage with lights and explosions and their whole set was energetic, frenetic and loud.&#160; their songs were much heavier than they had sounded on their cd and it was a manic mash up of squealing guitars and noise. i imagine that this signals a heavier direction for their new album but it could also be overcompensation for the fact that most of their music is pre-recorded and sampled.&#160; that meant that vocalist robbie furze was screaming his vocals and grinding his guitar while we debated amongst ourselves whether the bassist and drummer weren’t in fact miming.&#160; i am always happy for indie alternative bands to take on a heavier, louder sound; in fact, the noisier the better as far as i am concerned.&#160; but this was not a great performance.&#160; i’ve seen many bands that use heavy sampling including the prodigy, dan le sac vs scroobius pip and faithless and it is so difficult to put on a great show in front of a massive audience when the majority of your band members are doing little on the actual night but miming.&#160; the big pink didn’t really get it right on saturday night. bombay bicycle club bombay bicycle club hail from north london and took their name from a string of curry restaurants in the area.&#160; i have no idea what i expected from them before i heard them play on saturday night as i had barely even heard of them but wasn’t in the least bit interested in listening to any of their music. i certainly didn’t expect to have them rock my socks off.&#160; seconds into their first song, i found myself debating whether to rush off to the shops the next day or order their album through amazon.&#160; thankfully, such debates were soon put out of my mind as i got caught up in their energetic, enthusiastic set.&#160; the one thing they did prove was that the problems with the previous two acts weren’t down to bad acoustics in the venue because their whole sound and lights show was fabulous.&#160; jack steadman has a fantastically unique voice and the band are confident and exciting on stage.&#160; oh, and they can dance.&#160; perhaps the guys from the drum need to take some dancing lessons from them.&#160; the crowd went mad for them and i would have to say that bombay bicycle club were the best band of the night.&#160; it is not often that i am won over to unknown bands during a live performance but they were that good. the maccabees the maccabees played a massive fifteen song set on saturday night and gave one of the most impressive live performances i have seen in years.&#160; the maccabees are from south london but are currently based in london.&#160; they have five full time members but their incredible show included three musicians on brass instruments and at one stage edwyn collins joined them to sing “rip it up”.&#160; the maccabees use the whole stage and everything from their backdrop to their set up and lighting is absolutely professional and first class.&#160; i honestly found myself widening my eyes to try drink everything in.&#160; like with bombay bicycle club, the sound was perfect and the crowd went absolutely mad for the maccabees.&#160; they didn’t quite have the impact on me that bombay bicycle club did but that is not to say that they weren’t brilliant.&#160; they were really good and i’d definitely go see them again sometime. after a rocky start, the shockwaves nme awards tour 2010 was a huge success and bombay bicycle club and the maccabees certainly made up for a slightly shaky start.&#160; the best thing about the o2 brixton academy of course is that after the show, we were able to nip into nandos for some chicken burgers thus avoiding the british tradition of the post-night out dodgy vindaloo. if you are reading this anywhere besides emm

Male: 100%, Male, it is indeed sad that the failure of the middle order has become a subject of finger-pointing exercise; post the defeat of the indian team against the sri lankans in the final test. one cannot forget the fact that cricket is a team game and the failure of a team to win a match cannot and should not be attributed to the failure or success of a couple of individuals. the performance of the indian middle-order, especially that of the big four left much to be desired, would be stating the obvious. but to put the blame for the defeat on these men alone would be too simplistic. cricket is a team game and the team as a whole has to own up responsibility. what is alarming is the fact that none of these india-sri lanka tests stretched beyond the third or fourth day. this definitely isn’t a good sign for both the teams. the indian camp has reason to be more worried for being at the wrong end in the final test. one might be tempted to attribute this to the failure of the indian middle-order. the indian middle-order, made up of highly experienced and classy individuals who have lorded over some of the best spinners in the world, were ironically done-in by a pair of spinners from within the sub-continent. no doubt, these players are in their twilight years of cricket and time is perhaps ripe to find and groom replacements for some of these great men, but it isn’t going to be easy. we should learn to be patient and be prepared to face some initial set-backs for long-term gains. fortunately, we have enough talent readily available but the enormous experience and sheer greatness of these men presently donning the indian middle-order would be hard to replace. the indian bowling also needs some revamp. the spinners have been no match for the sri lankans and haven’t been consistent. overall, the indian bowling remains another weak-link in the side and will need some dressing up. the sri lankans can be proud of beating the indians in their own game. never before in the history of cricket have spinners been able to dominate the indians, as the duo of murali and mendis did in this series. mendis was easily the find of the series and i am sure we are going to hear a lot more about him in the coming years. the indians haven’t still figured him out completely, notwithstanding claims to the contrary from the indian camp. his eight wicket haul in the final test bears this out. however, i strongly believe murali’s presence was largely responsible for his phenomenal success. fortunately for mendis, murali has some more years of cricket left in him. together, the duo can rock some of the best teams in the world. it would be interesting to see how the aussies play this duo! the manner in which the indians have lost the first test to the sri lankans is absolutely shocking. the abject surrender in just one and a half days of play by a team which is renowned for its prowess in playing quality spin bowling is appalling, to say the least. some of the best spin bowlers in the world have struggled to make a mark against indians and it is disturbing that a couple of spinners from the sub-continent have dealt a crushing blow to this reputation and reduced the indian domination of spin bowling to a myth. what is even more worrying is the manner in which the indians lost their wickets. that most wickets fell to close-catching positions (catches at slips, forward short-leg, lbw’s, caught and bowled, etc.) is an indication that all is not well with the indian batting. it is clear that most batsmen failed to read the balls being hurled at them and ended up messing up their strokes. to think that the sri lankans scored 600 runs on the same wicket, with four of their batsmen getting hundreds, is even more disturbing. there was no devil in the wicket and if at all it did, it only existed in the minds of the indians. the indian batting line-up was thought to be one of the best in the world, but the inept display we saw today is a cause for serious concern. if the indians are hoping to make a come-back in this series, there was no indication of that whatsoever in the way the indians meekly surrendered to the guile of the sri lankan spinners. this is not to take the credit away from the sri lankan spinners. muthiah has proved what made him to be the highest wicket taker in the world, and in mendis, he has found an able partner to rock the indian boat. that the duo managed to do this on a “not-very-spinner-friendly track” should be a disconcerting thought for the indian camp and an indication on what to expect in the series. the onset of mendis seems to have sharpened the lethality of muthiah, and unless indians do some serious soul-searching, the series might well turn out to be a one-sided affair. sadly, the indian spinners have turned out to be no match for their sri lankan counterparts. the indian spinners should stop looking for spinner-friendly tracks every time they need to take wickets. it is time for harbhajan to deliver on unhelpful tracks……if muthiah can deliver with mendis, why not harbhajan with kumble? the big question when india left for australia was whether kumble and co had it in them to pick 20 wickets. not much was asked of india's 'famed' batting line-up. the reason was clear. a plethora of runs against pakistan in familiar conditions gave them a false sense of security. there were no demons in the mcg pitch; nor was the home side's bowling menacing to warrant two sub-200 scores. in fact the wicket was more indian than australian and the bounce was true till the end. it was disheartening to see the indians surrender meekly. the crushing defeat in the first test has opened the big debate again on the famous batting line-up's ability to score runs in tougher conditions. it was the bowlers who orchestrated india's test wins in south africa and england. the batsmen have consistently failed to deliver when taken out of their comfort zone. notwithstanding the odd good knock, the bitter truth is there is not enough firepower in our batting to challenge sides such as australia and south africa. the seeds for india's appalling show were sown in the first innings. after the bowlers had managed to keep the aussies to a reasonable score, the batsmen failed to keep the match alive. the result was on the wall the moment india was set a target of 499. the match was lost on day two. the batsmen would have done well to get some runs on the board and minimise the margin of defeat. the shot selection of the top-order left a lot to be desired. the approach of dravid and jaffer continues to puzzle me. how on earth are runs going to come in australia if batsmen continue to defend balls that have run written all over them? scoring areas have to be identified and every opportunity has to be seized. india's strength is scoring off boundaries but they will be tough to come by on these big grounds and against australia's watertight fielding. they will have to create plan b. it is important for the visitors to approach the remainder of the series with a positive frame of mind and not delve too much into this defeat. there is no harm in bringing in virendar sehwag. it is vital to have one player at the top of the order who can unsettle the attack. if yuvraj has to be sacrificed it has be to done in the interest of the team. it will be harsh on the southpaw after just one match. but it is important kumble gets the strategy right before it proves too late. i liked what the indian skipper said after the match. he insisted the batsmen have to bat more freely and that to me will lift the gloom that seems to have descended on the team. patience is wearing thin with india's poor running between the wickets and fielding efforts. the attack can do with all the help they can receive from the fielders. the aussie intensity even in the fourth innings was admirable. the indians can take a leaf out of that. it has certainly not been the best of starts but sydney provides a chance for india to redeem themselves. the wicket at the scg has always assisted spin and india should continue with two spinners. dravid going back to his familiar number three is also important for the team's success. bring in sehwag at the top and force the world champions do some thinking. the distance is alarming. what looked like a classic match up between the world 50-50 champions and t20 champions is turning out to be anything but. each of the first three games has proved beyond doubt the difference in class. superior athleticism has only widened the gulf. the aussies have come here with a definite plan and a bruised ego. the strip in kochi and the one at hyderabad should have favoured the hosts than anyone else. though they were not turners by any stretch of imagination there was enough for the tweakers to exploit. the team looks jaded and disoriented. the body language is negative. the third game was a bigger disappointment. dhoni and his band should have got a measure of the visitors by now. the bowlers are suffering for lack of discipline. they are either too full or short, the three quarter length that stuart clarke and mitchell johnson hit is ideal on these wickets and the sooner the indians resort to that length the better. the start in bangalore and kochi was wasted. the new ball did initial damage but the momentum was not to be sustained. it has a lot to do with the energy levels. the fielders don't swoop on the ball rather they wait for it come to them. lack of urgency in the field is hitting the team dearly. with any other side in world cricket one can make up with brilliance with the bat or ball but poor running between the wickets, poor throwing and dropped catches all add up sizably against the world champs. give an inch they end up with a mile. coming to the game on friday, m.s. dhoni might have been a trifle unlucky with the toss. the wicket looked like losing pace as the day wore. after a good start australia was pegged back by some good bowling by harbhajan and yuvraj singh. the new rule that insists on the ball to be changed after the 34 th over has not been kind to the men in blue. runs have been plundered in that phase. the best bowlers must be preserved for that phase. the ball might be a used one that is cleaned but there is a huge difference between a sphere that is used in practice and one that is used in a match. the hardness will be pronounced and it will come on to the bat better. it is an area captains will have to start putting some thought to. from 166 for three in 34 overs australia plundered 124 runs in the next 16 at 7.75 per over on a wicket that was getting increasingly difficult to bat on. once the target went beyond 260 it was always going to be an uphill climb for the indian's. yuvraj is doing justice to his enormous talent finally. he has always played the occasional blinder but the consistency he has brought to his game is refreshing. the team management can look up to him now for runs during crisis consistently. his shot selection has improved considerably and for a player blessed with enormous natural ability, it is only a question of getting into the right frame of mind. yuvraj is in that 'zone' where nothing much can go wrong. physically he did not look at his best yet played one of the best knocks in recent times. the match further showed the importance of a solid top-order. mathew hayden makes the difference at the top for his side with his consistency. matches cannot be won in the power play phase but one can set up a solid launch pad. 75 for three at the end of 20 overs was not the ideal start when chasing a big target. the opening overs will have to be counted. the problems are aplenty for dhoni, the team has to start believing it can beat australia and for that to happen they have to be more positive on the field. hearty congratulations to the indian team. the indomitable spirit proved decisive in the end. not having a reputation to live up to was the blessing in disguise. m.s. dhoni, yuvraj singh and harbhajan singh did not meet expectations in the final yet india pulled it off, thanks to players accepting responsibility and not getting overawed by the big stage. it was a fearless and modern approach from a bunch of youngsters in a format that is still foreign to many. both sides played a final which, made it worthy and only a mistake as elementary as one would get to see from the usually cool and collected soul, misbah-ul-haq was to be the difference between a nation rejoicing and another left in despair. there was not much to choose from the two sides. there were many positives india can draw from this campaign. the foremost being the captaincy of dhoni who remained unruffled throughout the championship. his calming influence was the apex on which, the indian wave rode. there was no place for individuals. every win was constructed on the nucleus called 'team effort', it helped shatter myths. no one was indispensable. if there was one player who was unable to deliver, there were two putting their hands up to chip in. the t20 has caught the imagination of the public and this win will herald a new era. as there were one-day specialists trying to make a mark in the early '90's, there will be a set of players who will train their thoughts and mind entirely to suit the demands of this format. one thing is certain there would be no place here for pretenders. dhoni winning the toss was a huge favour he did to his side. the pressure of a world cup final and add the name of the opponents, it would be an uphill task to chase the most meager of targets for india. gautham gambhir who received so much flak for not coming good against quality opposition silenced his critics with a knock that gave his team a chance to fight. his shot selection was sublime and effective at the same time. rohit sharma was a revelation; the youngster came good whenever an opportunity presented itself. the target was never going to be tough if pakistan resorted to percentage cricket. sorry that cannot be achieved in a india-pakistan clash. the pressure gets to you at some point and the mistakes start creeping in. younis khan and shoaib malik went into a shell and handed over the match to india. misbah is a player who takes calculated risks and believes in the theory the match is not over until the last ball. it reminded me of the great javed miandad who pulled the rug from under our feet on numerous occasions. r.p. singh delivered when it mattered and so did irfan pathan with his canny slow cutters. the entire pace and power had to be generated by the batsmen as joginder, and the pathan siblings provided them with nothing. it was a tactical ploy that worked on a wicket that slowed down a touch towards the end of the pakistan innings. a week from now no single player will be remembered, while the whole team would be. the most defining moment would yet be the brutal assault of yuvraj on a hapless stuart broad. the knock made the team believe it can test the best, and it was great to see the team carry the momentum from there. it was no fluke as the best in the business were left on the wayside. the transition has started. it is up to the selectors to try and help players from this team make a seamless change to the odi squad. the win has ushered in a new era. looking back the team was only a stroke away from defeat but they held their nerves. pakistan threw away an opportunity. misbah was better off hitting the ball straight and the shot he tried was never going to come off against the pace of joginder. the man who took them to the doorsteps of glory muffed it with a piece of poor cricket thinking. the pressure of india-pakistan cricket has made a mickey out of the best and it was no surprise it even had a cool head thinking otherwise. indian batting displayed its true strengths and potential on the second day at the oval as they piled 348 more runs in addition to their overnight score of 316 runs. indian first innings ended at a mammoth 664 all out but not before the cricket fans were treated to a feast of batting. in test cricket, half the match is won if the team batting first piles up a big enough total in the first innings and aims for an overwhelming result of an innings victory over the opposition. the australians have perfected this art and hence they are the number one side in the world now. it is very special to see the indians getting into this act and executing it in conditions away from home. cricket is a funny game and we have seen sides squander, given the best of batting conditions. nothing of that sort happened today and the indians made the best use of the pitch and started from where they left on day 1. england bowling was found much in wanting and their quality was exposed a great deal by a superlative indian batting. a tally of over 50 in the extras, wickets for part-timers like collingwood and pietersen, and the absence of sidebottom for a significant part of the day, made the english bowling look pedestrian and ineffective; full marks to the indian team for taking full advantage of the wayward english bowling and putting up a total that reflected a complete team effort. cricket is a team game and it takes all members of a side to contribute one way or the other for writing a success story. today, the indian batting was no less than a spotless team effort, with almost all batsmen contributing significantly with the willow, which made the mammoth 600 plus score a reality. tendulkar and laxman started the day's proceedings and the latter's innings had class stamped all over it -studded with 10 glorious hits to the fence. when the best of batsmen in world cricket today is willing to wait and spend a good time in the crease, it is ominous for the opposition. laxman and tendulkar built 78 for the fifth wicket before laxman was dismissed. tendulkar's hard-working innings was once again left unrewarded as he was dismissed caught in the slips for a well-made 82. 417/6 could have easily become 450 – 460 all out, with the tail-enders meekly surrendering their wickets, but that was not to be. the determination of the lower order to contribute runs to the team’s kitty is what separates a normal team from a great team. the indian lower order showed grit and confidence in scoring runs. the final four wickets fell to a substantial addition of 247 runs, but there was more to it than mere statistics. mahendra singh dhoni was in his usual belligerent mood, smashing a quick-fire 92 of just 81 deliveries and his innings was studded with 9 fours and four sixes. the baton of run scoring changed from the belligerent dhoni to a determined kumble. a batsman, after getting a body blow, can easily develop mental block and fade away. it takes a strong character to show determination to fight it out in the middle, and anil kumble is not new to this as he had shown us in the west indies in 2002, when he was hit in the chin while batting and still came back to bowl and claim brian lara's wicket. this time it was his batting that made all the difference, for a change!! he has the earned the distinction of being the first indian to score a century in this series. this knock is perfectly befitting a man who has won many a matches for india in his glorious career, and perhaps, in his final test in england. kumble's unbeaten 110 was studded with as many as 16 hits to the fence and one over the ropes as well. sreesanth, zaheer khan and rp singh also chipped in with decent contributions to help kumble reach his century and take india to a commanding position in this test match. england have only themselves to blame for some bad bowling, ordinary fielding and mediocre behind-the-stumps effort, with byes accounting 33 of the total 54 extras, much to the dismay of matt prior. wicket-keepers in cricket are best judged by the number of byes they concede and england seems to be lacking in that area as well. lots to cheer for india on their on-field exploits today and lots to think for the england team management at the end of the second day's play at the oval. with kumble scoring a 100, one would fancy his bowling to come good for india. if it does happen, this test might well be remembered for kumble’s exploits and greatness as a tough cricketer. coming to the english batting, if the indian bowlers can get michael vaughan and kevin pieterson out early, it will be half the match won. i am looking forward to more positive cricket from the indians, as do the millions of you fans of indian cricket out there. it is imperative for team india to keep the momentum going. a closer look at history reveals that india almost immediately hand over the advantage after taking the lead in an away test series. the latest example was the tour to south africa where the cricket became suddenly unimaginative after the win in johannesburg. the focus should be on continuing the good work. a win can make a team to take it a bit easy, and rahul dravid and his men would do well to continue with the positive ways and not get caught in a negative mindset. sourav ganguly proved his detractors wrong and there should be no doubt that the visitors will play the same team in the final test. runs are available aplenty at the oval. the first morning might have something in it for the bowlers but from day two it should become a perfect batting strip. it would take a gutsy captain to bat first on this wicket. batting second would be a safer option and batting last at the oval is not a tedious job. i would expect dravid to take field if he is to win the toss. with the lead already in hand india has a good chance of batting england out of the series. the form of v.v.s. laxman and sourav has provided the cutting edge. it is always important for the middle order to fire at the old blighty. once the second new ball is on life can be difficult even for the batsman who is well settled. chris tremelet with his bounce and lift proved what he is capable of and the indian's should have chalked out a plan for him by now. the difference between victory and defeat even for the mighty aussies hinged on adam gilchrist's success at seven in the last two tours. in 2001 he had the english bowling at his mercy but in 2005 he was not half his own self and that tilted the balance in the hosts favour. it is important for dhoni to contribute with sourav and laxman. one bad session and things can turn upside down. the bowling department looked no good on paper but it has exceeded expectations. zaheer khan has taken the burden of spearheading the attack brilliantly. add sreesanth's inability to deliver zaheer's work stands taller. the success of zaheer has a lot to do with the attention he has started to pay at what is happening at the other end. he has learnt to deal differently with each batsman. bowling is two-way traffic. there will phases in a match where a bowler will have to get to run-control mode but that is not getting defensive it is just a part of a ploy to get to the batsmen. zaheer has done just that and add anil kumble's ability to mop the tail quickly the duo has more than made up for the lack of consistency on sreesanth's part. r.p. singh has been the surprise element. his deceptive pace and his strong wrist is tailor made for english conditions and his ability to move the ball both ways has left even the best a confused lot. with the top three performing brilliantly, the only change that could possibly happen is r. bose coming in place the visitors should approach the game as they would to any other. it has happened in the past, the team has tried defensive ploys when they are trying to defend a hard earned lead. it has cost them dear and this resurgent side that has shown great mental fortitude and losing the grip after gaining the lead could be a thing of the past. there may have been a bit of a stutter at the end. the rest of the test was one smooth flow for team india. not for a moment did rahul dravid and his boys look like the side that was saved by the elements when defeat looked inevitable in the opener at lord's. the opening partnership between wasim jaffer and dinesh karthik in the first innings swung the game so much in the visitor's favour that it never gave england a chance in the match. a handy first innings did the hosts in. as it happened at lord's, it is difficult for a side to wriggle out of a tight corner once the momentum goes to the other side. with a lead of 283, all india needed was one good session with the ball on the fourth day to warp up the test. it was good toss to win for dravid and his spearhead zaheer khan responded well. the conditions were loaded in favour of the bowlers but it must be said that it was intelligent bowling that helped to keep england to below 200. the best part of zaheer's performance was his ability to keep a high percentage of his deliveries in the good length area. with the wicket helping the ball to seam, it was important for the bowlers to bowl in the right areas. while sreesanth seemed to get lost in his act of the comedic villain, the emergence of r.p. singh as a strike force came as a breather. rahul could ill afford two of his bowlers to be off the radar in the same game. r.p. singh who is generally taken lightly can be deceptively sharp. his strong and straight wrist that helps the fingers to follow the seam all the way through in his action is his biggest ally. his high arm action helps him generate bounce and also to skid the ball off the surface when he bowls a fullish length. both zaheer and singh were tough to negotiate as they moved the ball either way. it is not easy for the batsmen when it moves both ways and it leads to doubts creeping in. the conditions were better for batting in the second innings as the wicket had eased out. it needed a strong will and self-belief in the bowlers. they succeeded with style and panache. anil kumble played his usual role of mopping up the tail quickly and his contribution with the bat and his half-century association with v.v.s. laxman were vital to the plot. it was a win where almost everyone played his part to perfection. what i enjoyed most was the ruthlessness of the indians. they did not give a chance for england to come back in to the game. the innings by michael vaughan was a class act. it did not get its due as the media trained its thoughts on the indian win. until the english skipper was in, there was a good chance of the game to end in a draw. to india's credit, their shoulders did not droop while paul collingwood and vaughan were making merry. a bit of luck was required on this shirtfront and it arrived in the form of vaughan's wicket. once that partnership was broken it was only a matter of time. as i had said before, the team needed the top guns to click collectively. the top-order contributed handsomely. it was the sixth highest test match total without a single hundred. sourav ganguly came up with a classy knock and proved his detractors, including yours truly, wrong. the seniors in the team whose very presence in the team was being questioned came to the party and the youngsters complemented their efforts well. it was a resurgent side that deserved every inch of this famous win. 
Female: 100%, Female, i started digging my wallet for the extra quarter and he seemed to sense that i wanted a bag for my lonely little oj, and i told him that no! i didn't need one. i fished out the quarter and laid it on the counter as he handed me the oj and smiled warmly.as i walked away, i felt filled with an unexpected joy and contentment. in that moment, i felt the city wrap around me for the first time in a while, protectively cuddling me from all sides. i looked around and saw the new york i had first seen in 2004: that energy, that life, that art pulsing through everything. no matter how many chain coffee houses there are, or how much money gets poured into meaningless capitalistic pursuits in this city, there will always be that feeling of endless possibility, that freedom, like if you just believe in it and want it bad enough, you can literally be anything you want. that feeling, that uniquely new york feeling, is something that everyone who ever came to new york to pursue a dream has experienced and can speak to, whether it was in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, or beyond; and as i walked the block to my office from the coffee cart - which, by the way, was set up right across the street from a starbucks - i felt it pressing on me in the most comforting way.despite everything i've been through, and all the uncertainty that continues to face me, i heard the city telling me it's going to be ok, and i believed it. i put my hands in the pockets of my trench coat, smiled to myself and walked on. 
Male: 100%, Male,  ok i thought the first post was long enough as it is, so here is the second part of my rig building process. the next component in question is the power supply a.k.a psu. i never really thought i have to invest in something like a psu. i didn't quite expect the choice of psu to be of high importance and now after enough enlightenment from my fellow pc assemblers, i have learned to respect them. the choice of the psu can either power your system or can blow your rig sky high or it can melt your motherboards beyond recognition. power supply unit corsair vx450w my new system , originally uploaded by rakesh ashok . as i was saying above the psu is also a very important part of any rig. this wasn't the first choice that came to the mind of te members when i asked for suggestions for psu. the first was the gigabyte superb 460w and the second was seasonic s12ii-380w. both these were really good products from what i read from reviews elsewhere. then after assessing that the seasonic was better than the gigabyte product i decided to go with it. but unfortunately the place where i went to seek out this product haven't even of the name seasonic. one guy even took and gave me a zebronics psu. zebronic and seasonic does sound a lot similar don't they. again i had to look out for alternatives. thus i came upon the corsair vx 450w. well it was a bit too costly for me though. nevertheless it is the perfect fit. best features of this psu are really quite fan and nylon sleeved wires for better wire management in your cabinet. bought this psu for a princely sum of 4050rs in richie street. though right now its an overkill for my current config without a gpu. but it definitely is a good choice considering the fact that i would definitely get myself a gpu probably the ati radeon hd5770 or the 5750. here are some reviews to help you along with your decision. corsair vx450w: quiet value psu corsair vx450w power supply review will be continued... <!-- just finished adding the motherboard section in the review of my new system . <!-- this is the song which i just can't seem to stop listening. i slept while hearing this and it was playing till morning :). the song lyrics are too good even though i had a hard time understanding most of the words since they don't seem to be the regular hindi words which i usually hear or some other kind of dialect, not really sure which one. but i love this song. just this song alone has made me want to see this movie. so i'm definitely watching this movie. also the picturization of the song is also too good plus the voice of rahat fateh ali khan and the laid back nature all makes this a song a super hit. have to thank vishal bharadwaj for this beautiful music. enjoy the song dil to bachcha hai . i don't ever remember writing a post for a single song. but i haven't written about that many things either he he ... <!-- my new system , originally uploaded by rakesh ashok . after nearly 9 years i have finally upgraded my system. till now i was using a pentium iii computer which has survived well past its shelf life. i was also getting annoyed using that system since i can't watch hd video in it, i can't play some games if i get bored, i can't even multitask since it hangs if i do so. so i decided it is finally time to upgrade my system. and this is it. i assembled the entire rig on my own. i took liberal advice from my tech enclave friends to decide upon the components. here are the individual components. processor amd athlon ii x4 620 quad core image source: bit-tech.net i remember myself hating amd in the early days since it was dead slow and never performed as advertised (experience from using my friends computer). but what i hadn't realized is that amd put away all those things behind them and have started delivering better goods for cheap and is right now giving intel a run for its money. now my cpu i.e. the athlon ii x4 is a quadcore processor meaning it has four processors built in one chip. this is the first quadcore in the market that sells at around 5k. the intel quadcore is nearly double or more. i was initially planning on a intel based system but was blown away by the amd offering. here are some reviews about this cpu. amd athlon ii x4 620: quad core for the masses at $100 amd athlon ii x4 620 &amp; 630: the first $99 quad core cpu amd athlon ii x4 620 cpu review after reading all that review i'm sure you can imagine why i switched to amd. i got it for 5200rs in chennai. the cpu doesn't get very hot so the stock cpu fan is enough for cooling it. it's totally unnecessary to waste money on cpu coolers for this cpu. the maximum temperature i have seen is around 40 degree but usually runs at around 32-34 degrees. motherboard asus m4a785td-v evo image source: unitycorp.co.jp choosing the motherboard was the toughest decision i took while building my rig. for starters i had absolutely no idea about the various technologies involved. the brands, features it was mind numbing. so after hearing the first two or three suggestions from the te gang, i started exploring those motherboards and their features. almost all suggested the gigabyte board, gigabyte 785gmt-ud2h . this is a micro atx board meaning a smaller sized board. i had decided to go with this board. when i reached richie street i was not able to find this board. since i was at that time impatient i decided to go with an alternative having the exact same features. thus i bought the asus m4a785td-v evo. well the name asus is not new in the motherboard, infact it is among the top contenders in the market. the highlights of the board are full atx board supporting am3 cpus , ddr3, igp (ati hd4200), 128mb of ddr3 sideport memory, two pci-e 2.0 slots lots of usb slots and lots more. the real plus point is that i can fit bigger gpus in the future when i buy one. :) this board is quite heavy and it fills your cabinet, so make sure you buy a bigger cabinet for this one. this is also the costliest component in my rig excluding my monitor of course. it cost me 6600rs . bit-tech.net review - asus m4a785td-v evo review overclock3d :: review :: asus m4a785td-v evo 785g atx preview read the second part of my rig building process <!-- its hard to come by wallpapers for my e51. so i have started downloading photos and making wallpapers by cropping them and editing to suit the looks. this one is actually a picture of trisha from her upcoming movie vinnaithandi varuvaya. you can use this wallpaper for other mobiles with 240 x 320 resolution too. <!-- good|sam: a short film by anthony pierce and hunter richards from hunter h. richards on vimeo . voted best short at the 2008 salem film festival in the nw shorts category, winner if the the northwest emerging artist award. good|sam takes us to the long forgotten place of childhood innocence. this film reminds us that the ability to rise above circumstance is simply a matter of perspective. written and directed by anthony pierce cinematography by hunter richards www.hunterhrichards.com produced by minimalist films features an original score by andrew michael kangas &amp;

Female: 100%, Female, we are so pleased to announce that our new website is up and running. we are officially moving all of our blog activity to our new www.urbansprouts.org site. please check it out and bookmark our new page. i recently learned from my students that oxalis, an invasive and aggressive weed for many san francisco gardeners, is also called sourgrass, whose flower stalk can actually be chewed. although oxalis has another beneficial function, that is, to prevent soil erosion on slopes, i can't help but feel that every time i'm up at one of my schools, it's a renewed battle between oxalis and gardener. last week, i issued a challenge to my students at ida b. wells to pull out as much oxalis as they could from our two main beds, which would be documented as before and after pictures on this blog. although some students went right to work, others required much more coaxing; many students seem to have an inherent dislike of weeding, even if it's just the patch in front of them. at the end of class and after three huge piles of oxalis, it still looked like we barely made a dent in the ratio of oxalis to vegetables. note to self - next time, to prevent oxalis takeovers, try mulching early before the rains start. before weeding around the fava beans... after weeding (one student's work)... mulching with straw with my afterschool class... i am very excited to bring to you a glimpse of a day in our gardens. thanks to our new flip cameras, you can see urban sprouts in action preparing freshly harvested collards into delicious, simple, gourmet snacks! students at both martin luther king middle school and international studies academy have gotten excited about sharing their perspective of the garden to the community and each other. in the near future i hope to use the flip camera as a medium of communication between the two schools. at urban sprouts, we want to connect students to local produce, whether it's food from the school garden, persimmons and lemons from someone's backyard, or fresh finds from the farmer's market. at aptos middle school, the lettuce, arugula, and radish from our school garden were ready to be harvested and tossed into a salad. students washed, chopped, and combined local fruits and vegetables with a sesame salad dressing and a persimmon vinagrette. although some students were more interested in the cooking than in the eating, it was a first step towards creating healthy (and colorful) dishes using many local ingredients. additionally, students at ida b. wells continuation high school learned how to whip up persimmon ice cream using only five ingredients (lemon, vanilla, sugar, buttermilk, and persimmons), and without a fancy ice cream maker. thank you, ms. bressack, for donating the delicious persimmons from your backyard! help grow the school gardens movement! we are looking for members to join our outreach committee. these individuals will work alongside our staff to represent urban sprouts at partner school events, community fairs, farmers markets, and other city-wide events. please join us for our first meeting december 8th, 2009 451 hayes st 2nd floor san francisco, ca 94102 questions or want more information?

Male: 100%, Male, welcome to grade 1: "alright students, what does an ichthyosaur look like?"&nbsp; "they look like dolphins !"&nbsp; " whales , like whales!"&nbsp; "yeah fish !!!"&nbsp; "shaaarks!"&nbsp; "ooo ooo, mr. bond , oooo???!" "yes, billy?" " miga !&nbsp; they look like miga !"&nbsp; "yeah!!! miga !!!"&nbsp; " migamigamigaaaaa !!!!" "settle down children! children! ugh..." miga , for the uninitiated, was an olympic mascot here in vancouver - part bear and part orca .&nbsp; i assume it is the orca that billy, the made-up child in this real-life situation, is relating ichthyosaurs to.&nbsp; dolphins, whales, fish, orca - are ichthyosaurs so similar?&nbsp; or, like miga, more of a mix of creatures? or are we just imposing our understanding of extant animals upon extinct ones?&nbsp; what did ichthyosaurs look like? with these beautiful aquatic reptiles being the focus of art evolved 's next gallery , i thought we should begin discussing how exactly they should be reconstructed.&nbsp; what are the current controversies palaeo-artists are dealing with when restoring ichthyosaurs from fossil to flesh? darren naish (at tetrapod zoology) recently (sept. 2008) discussed a few of the assumptions we make when we think of what ichthyosaurs look like and how they behave.&nbsp; did they really have dorsal fins?&nbsp; how much of our knowledge of ichthyosaur body shape was faked by unscrupulous preparators?&nbsp; most aquatic swimmers ( fish, dolphins ) have a dorsal fin, two pectoral fins and a powerful tail.&nbsp; why did ichthyosaurs retain their two hind-fins?&nbsp; in an older article , naish ponders the question: did they use their pectoral fins and "fly" underwater?&nbsp; there are also a few questions i'd like to ask here, confronting the traditional view about ichthyosaurs: 1) was their skin slick and smooth like a dolphin, or bumpy and scaly like a monitor lizard? 2)&nbsp; did they eat only squid and ammonites? 3)&nbsp; did all genus of ichthyosaur reproduce through live birth? 4)&nbsp; did they partake in cannibalistic behavior? 5)&nbsp; what did the huge shonisaurs eat? 6)&nbsp; could i have ridden one? 7)&nbsp; isn't there an easier way to spell "ichthyosaur?"&nbsp; maybe with less h's? i am hoping that some of our readers might have some insight into the world of ichthyosaurs!&nbsp; help us reconstruct more accurate creatures! &nbsp; speak up!&nbsp; we won't bite! ...much! and to get our collective ichthyosaur brains working, watch this they might be giants " nine bowls of soup ," staring mr. ichthyosaur... some fantastically modern artwork from 1959. use the contents drop-down menu to go the the “where evolution stands today” article. check out the ads along the way. i adore the way that evolution is embraced by this popular magazine and - yeah, feel nostalgic. note: cross-posted from my blog because this is just too cool. &nbsp; when i say "therapod" what pops into your mind?&nbsp; a sharp-toothed, fleet-footed, flesh-eating monster of a dinosaur, right?&nbsp; tyrannosaurs, spinosaurs, raptors... but what about a squat, tiny-headed, long-necked, plant-eater? these plant-eating therapods are known to the world as therizinosaurs - named 'scythe lizard' on account of their abnormally large claws on their hands. this family of dinosaurs (therizinosauridae), previously know as segnosaurs, has a strange and convoluted history of discovery, with palaeontologists at times calling them "turtle-like lizards," prosauropods, and carnivorous reptiles.&nbsp; it wasn't until the discovery of similar genus' in the 80's and 90's, that therizinosaurs were finally classified as advanced herviborous maniraptorian theropods. recreating an animal so recently reinterpreted takes skill, research, and time.&nbsp; the wonderful results from this process are collected below - a time capsule full of therizinosaurs , recreated in glorious pencil, paint, and pixels!&nbsp; to participate in this and future time capsules, all you need to do is send your image to artevolved@gmail.com .&nbsp; it's not too late to join in the fun! so without further ado, welcome to art evolved's therizinosaur gallery! click to enlarge them! &nbsp; &nbsp; a brief look at therizinosaur reconstructions through the years by tricia arnold &nbsp; &nbsp; alxasaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beipiaosaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; erliansaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; erlikosaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; falcarius by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; nanshiungosaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; segnosaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; nothronychus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; nothronychus mckinleyi in graphite penci l by mo hassan &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; therizinosaurus by brett booth &nbsp; &nbsp; therizinosaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; therizinosaurus by&nbsp; luis perez &nbsp; &nbsp; therizinosaur (aka chickenosaur!) by rachael revelle a4 lino print - produced as a live blog and documented on my blogsite&nbsp;' drawn in time '. therizinosaurus: a creature from jim henson's the dark crystal by sarah snell-pym i started off by looking at creatures i thought had similar features or habitat niches to the therizinosaurs and then drew a 'shape' outline from a skeletal representation p199 of vertebrate palaeontology 2nd edition. the creature seems to have had an identity crisis in the world of palaeontology but the most recent stuff i found suggested feathers and stiff hair type structures so that's what i went with. my actual aim was to build an evolution of therizinosaurs in palaeontology of which this would be one of the end members! &nbsp; therizinosaur by anthony contoleon therizinosaurus 2000 by david tana an early attempt at reconstructing therizinosaurus ( late cretaceous period, china ) , using only pencil and paper. therizinosaurus cheloniformis 2010 by david tana reconstruction of therizinosaurus cheloniformis from the late cretaceous period of mongolia, china.&nbsp; digital scan of pencil on paper. therizinosaur by craig dylke &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; giant claw by matthew tames &nbsp; here is a scene of a pair of therizinosaurs protecting their nest. &nbsp; &nbsp; therizinosaurus cheloniformis feeding on ginkgo by john meszaros the&nbsp;geometrical stone structures&nbsp;in the background&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;columnar basalt formation&nbsp;such as can be found at the giant's causeway in northern ireland or the devil's postpile in california. a slap in the face by peter bond a therizinosaurus cheloniformis repells an attack by a passing alioramus remotus on a floodplain in mongolia, 70-65 million years ago. i wanted to illustrate one of the less-shown uses of those giant claws. hopefully the alioramus can afford the facial reconstruction surgery! therizinosaurine! by peter bond maniraptors: therizinosauria by albertonykus (from shortest to longest: beipiaosaurus inexpecticus, falcarius utahensis, and therizinosaurus cheloniformis .)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the therizinosaurs were a group of strange-looking maniraptors. this caused a lot of confusion in the past. for example, some therizinosaurs (then known as segnosaurs) were thought to be prosauropods (basically all the sauropodomorphs besides the giant four-legged sauropods). it was a while before the segnosaurs and therizinosaurs were recognized as the same group within maniraptor theropods. therizinosaurs had gigantic claws, but their tiny heads and teeth suggest they were plant eaters. to be fair, they aren't the only plant-eating theropods ( [link] ), but few other theropods show such extreme herbivory. &nbsp; &nbsp; therizinosaurus by jared needle from a 13 (or 12) inch square of double mc tissue paper, violet/orange.&nbsp;&nbsp; still in progress after two months. it has literally been standing like that for a month straight before i photographed it today . it's obviously missing a head. i've gone through at least a dozen attempts over the last month, and still have yet to design a satisfactory head.

Female: 100%, Male,  i know, it was early, but they had it on saturday for some reason. it also rained cats and dogs. reporters in the rotunda. today i shot two portraits. both left me frustrated, both were my own fault. i just couldn't get them to go right, i was taking too long then the people started getting impatient, in turn the impatience with myself grew and i am left with a handful of "missing it" photos and none that really get the job done. i have been exchanging emails with a student over the past few days regarding portraiture; and after today i feel a bit like a hypocrite. i shot this photo of the cricket a few days ago and the entire shoot lasted about 7 seconds. i didn't really pose her, just told her to freeze while i grabbed my camera. there is a magic in some portraits that no matter how hard you try you just can't extract in other situations. what worked two days ago with little to no effort couldn't be replicated even with exponentially more time today. weird. we had escaped to arizona to feel some heat on our skin and breathe that lingering citrus and desert smell. i was laying in the backyard, my arms tired from a canoe ride that morning and little wooden plates of cheese, crackers and hummus appear from the house and the family gets their picnic on. half knowingly i left my camera sitting for most of the trip but had to pick it up just to remember how nice it felt to sit on the lawn with the cricket and her family, feel springs sneak peek, mix german and english mid sentence and eat good cheese. this is manfred, visiting from berlin and thoroughly enjoying all that surrounded us. the bishop of salt lake city had some nice light going on at a concert downtown. i had to shoot a fire/suspected arson a few nights ago. it always amazes me how open some people can be in a tragic situation. this mother, her mother and two kids were woken up by a neighbor banging on the door telling them to get out of the house. they didn't have time to get sweaters or coats and had been outside in a utah winter for at least 25 minutes by the time i arrived. i chatted with them for a bit, they were obviously still shook up and worrying about where they were going to sleep. i asked if i could shoot a few photos for the paper and they said that was fine. i stuck around and we talked for a bit and i started to wonder why they were so open and friendly to a stranger hired to be privy to their problems. these things have been in my mind quite a bit since returning from haiti. there has been quite a bit of talk about the morality and ethics of photojournalists in haiti following the quake. i read some of it and had to open up a bit so i wouldn't get too defensive while reading the criticisms of some of the media working down there. i am not afraid of good dialogue so i left a few comments on some of these critical blog postings. my feeling was that, in some cases 'being there' and documenting someones life is an implicit display of respect for the value of the situation. joy and her mother sandra (pictured) further cemented this idea for me. there is an entire discussion regarding photographic approach and sensationalism which belongs to this examination, but for this post, i'll just assume that you know what i mean. the problem is that there are hundreds of variables in every sit uation where photos are taken in the name of photojournalism, so an application of some overarching philosophy has it's faults. but as far as this little family is concerned, i felt like they were open to me in that moment because that respect was apparent. maybe not, but i wanted to at least precede haiti photos with some sort of introduction into how i feel about what i do and those in the photographs. lgbt community protesting some remarks made in association with the announcement that their issues aren't on the schedule for the legislative calendar this year. whether you are aligned with them or not, it seems like a real cop out from the law makers to just avoid a group of issues...especially when it's coincidentally an election year. sometimes as a photojournalist you are right in the thick of things and still don't get the full story. from what common sense tells me, avoiding an issue that is obviously really important to large groups of people doesn't seem like representation. anyone who knows more, specifically about this here in sl is welcome to comment, wouldn't mind being enlightened. 
Female: 100%, Female,  thrift shirt and skirt. gap sweatshirt. pictures i took back when my hair was blonde and there was snow outside and i wasn't all lazy and in a style rut like now. any ideas as to what a story to them could be? i haven't the slightest idea. today in school we played dodgeball. or, rather, i played dodgeball, and everyone else played kickball. but then they were all "noo come on you can't be that bad" and i was like "hahah that's what you think" and then they made me kick it and i ran to the wrong base. actually, i didn't even run to a base, i just ran to this random mat that i thought was a base, but was just in the way, and pointless, kind of like the interpretive dancing at the oscars. but you know what would've made this experiment far less painful? if i had been wearing this: along with paying a visit to the 60's (my favorite era, which is probably some kind of twist of fate) (see what i did there? bob dylan song? 60's?) (oh wait, that song is actually 70's. i...fail. anyway.) miu miu was almost cartoonish with its giant bows, poppy colors, scallops, exaggerated pocket piping, and shoe skirts that added an extra clunky stomping factor to the overall effect. and there were lots of embellishments with metallic bows and flowers, kind of as if the wearer was a little girl going through her grandma's jewelry box (from when grand mam mam had her 60's heydey) and sort of decorating herself with brooches. it started out with the bright colors and cartoon-ish lace (which i will now refer to as the little sister of prada's ) but towards the end got to a place that was darker, a different kind of romantic, slightly stark.. the silhouettes, colors, and fabrics became more sophisticated, and the playful, wiry flower brooches were replaced by some in full bloom. there were parts i didn't care for or that wouldn't have really improved today's game of kickball, (which is now the new standard for everything: would it improve my pitiful, athletically-challenged middle school experiences? would it?) such as the low cut-overall situations and skirts-over-pants (maybe because i was too reminded of my 3rd grade days when i decided i was really edgy and //alt for wearing a skirt over a pair of jeans. the memories, make them stopppppp). they didn't feel out of place in the collection but my sentiments for them were those of enid's here: the spring collection will always be my favorite, and that kind of magic can't happen twice. but over all, it was cute and fun and miu miu. and it still would've made that really awful game of kickball much, much better. prada fall 2008 / miu miu fall 2010. hussein chalayan was based around the idea of a mirage, though that fact was no mirage as the sunglasses said, "mirage". dad jokes! in all seriousness, because this is serious business, as things always are around here, i first thought it was sort of arbitrary, but the more i looked through it and thought about it the more it made sense, and the fact that it was hard to understand at first only made me like it more. and made it more, of course, like a mirage. i see what you did there, mr. chalayan. there were binoculars stuffed up with shearling and leather, hazy nebula-like prints, foggy sheer fabrics, and crocheted jackets that only half-covered the top part of the body. without the concept, the clothes didn't seem to flow from one look to another too well, but i don't think a hussein chalayan collection can be viewed without knowing that there has to be a concept, anyway. the "mirage" sunglasses reminded me of new year's eve sunglasses, in a good way. i am not normally one for red carpet dressing (other than the cfda gala) and last night we didn't even get tilda or cate, and the co-hosting was awkward, and twilight is not a horror movie, and zac efron still highly resembles a neopet, but carey mulligan filled the prada void that would have been otherwise occupied by tilda with this dress that looks very pretty and normal at first... but then when you look at a closer picture, you see this, and if you happen to be looking at the closer picture while it's really late and night and you just ate/drank your weight in sugary products, your reaction is 3x the excitement, or, udisghdslugwhuiwgsd tiny kitchen utensils! for tiny murderers! chick is basically wearing a clue gameboard, and it is fantastic. and robert downey jr. looked awesome. i would like to think that he and michelle obama play kickball together in their matching lanvin sneakers. well done, sherlock, well done. that's about it. again, don't really care for red carpet-type stuff but throw some tiny knives and bow ties into the mix and i am intrigued. oh, and tom ford. throw tom ford into the mix and i am also intrigued, and also maybe sitting two inches away from the screen, never mind that it is in the corner of the room hanging from a ceiling. i use my floating powers when necessary, okay? lastly, i love you all more than rainbows. vivienne westwood was like a maurice sendak character that runs away to start her own kingdom, aka, what i would like to do, all the time, a lot. paper crowns, crayon scribbles (some of which read "prince charming") and drapy dresses that could've come out of an older sister's dress-up box..plus, only vivs could put her models in marker moustaches (time for me to revisit tomas , perhaps?) and it still make sense. and, going back to the maurice sendak thing: wild rumpus crowns, anyone? that star on that grey sweatshirt is totally really rosie? life complete. at the independent fashion bloggers conference at nyfw, there was a panel including the fashionista girls, susie bubble , phil oh , bryanboy , and myself, and we talked about-wait for it- the future of fashion blogging ! pretty random topic, if you ask me. there's a video but i'm too afraid to watch it because i probably said some stupid things. but! if i were to paraphrase, i would say we mostly talked about: -discretion when it comes to accepting gifts or freebies. -advice to new bloggers. (which mostly came to: write about what is interesting to you. what works for one blogger doesn't always work for another, and writing about the exact same stuff that a popular blogger writes about will go unnoticed since someone else is already doing the same thing.) -a blogger's place at fashion week. -hey, remember when we all decided we were the greatest people ever and that blogs were the new everything? me neither! the media likes the story but it ain't no big thang. -we can't predict the future of fashion blogging. the same way no one saw it coming, no one knows where it will go. the big difference between bloggers and journalists isn't the fact that we're using computers. i mean, cathy horyn and lynn yaeger have blogs, lots of critics write for style.com, and a number of editors, including hamish bowles and andre leon talley, write blog posts; but it's not the same as my having a blog - the difference is experience. it's not remarkable that we're using the internet!!! but what most people are pointing out - with me, mostly, since this doesn't apply to the other bloggers that were on the panel - is lack of experience. i haven't gone to journalism school, i haven't had any internships, etc. and i'm 13, which, oh my god, i can't tell you how excited i am to outgrow that number. this, honestly, is what i think is the future of fashion blogging, or at least part of it. the same way teenagers can start a flickr account and be noticed by a magazine, or a band can start a myspace and be picked up by a label, blogs will act as jumping-off platforms for people that want to work in the industry. when i started style rookie in march of 2008, only ellegirl and teenvogue.com would write about blogs. it wasn't a big media thing and having one wasn't an affiliation for fashion week, it was a nice circle of ladies and occasional dudes who supported each other and often found themselves saying "thank you for this post! none of my friends get my feelings about ______." then some of us started taking opportunities that had arisen, and i spent some money on a hussein chalayan dress, and then all of a sudden it was like, judaaaaaaaaaas. which is, you know, bizarre. allow me to direct you to this epic dave eggers essay . so now my inbox and comment section are full of "can you critique my blog? can you tell me what to do to get invited to shows? how do i get my blog recognized in the industry?" which isn't a bad thing, i guess (other than the critiquing thing, which like..it's about you and your thoughts. no one is able to tell you what to think or how to explain your thinking to others.) now blogging is a full-time job for some people and in some cases a segway into the industry but i guess that's the way it goes. and it's sort of a bummer, especially because now i'm far more aware of the number of people that read my blog, and when i take this into consideration when writing a post i feel pressured to sound smarter or fancier when mostly i just enjoy writing journal-like streams of thought (my blog has always been a virtual diary) even though i'm supposed to be writing grand reviews because a newspaper or magazine told whoever to expect that. that's a problem with my own outlook, though, and i still enjoy blogging. a lot. and, thankfully, it doesn't have to be a job for me. when it starts to feel like one, i'll stop. but i don't think anyone is saying blogs are the equivalent to magazines, or inexperienced bloggers like myself are the equivalent to journalists, anyway. still, there is nothing wrong with having a range of perspectives. i think fashion is important to discuss. which brings me to this recent isabel marant quotation: “for me, fashion shows are not for the public, they are trade shows for the press. it’s time for the press to understand the collection and then spread the information. that’s more interesting than just the image. everyone wants to be first. it’s too too much. there should be privacy and mystery. there is no excitement about anything anymore as everything is available immediately and all the time – you don’t have to wait for anything. i don’t like the idea of being flooded with image and information. i don’t belong to the generation of spending time on the internet. i think it’s too fast and too fake. it’s like going to a museum on the internet – where is the pleasure? it’s sad because everyone is running after everything, but after what? everything is too quick. there is no room in your heads for all this information. no one retains anything.” i think that when it comes to fashion shows being online, it's exposure for a brand. i think that a customer deserves to see the show and get to know the world of that label. i like privacy and mystery too, but there's a fine line between that and exclusivity. and-twist!-i also hate the fastness of the internet! and the fakeness! i like buying my magazines and zines and having special stuff i can hold in my hand! and this internet, it makes the already fast fashion very very fast! and it's scary and a lot of it feels very unauthentic and sad. and fast. but, in five years, the iphone will be oldy mcoldster from oldsville, oldesota. and tumblr then will be like xanga now. who knows where fashion blogging will be. point is, things are changing. "classics with a twist!" retro futurism! in fashion, all those cliches have been done time and again, but i think that nicolas ghesquiere's collection for balenciaga was the only one as of recent to elevate these concepts to a level that was more refined and thoughtful. "retro futurism" didn't mean the jetsons, and "classics" didn't mean camel coats or button-downs. they were elements of home-living and domesticity that were brought into the present with what has now become nicolas longname's signature futurism aesthetic. he said his goal was "to ennoble every day objects." mission accomplished. ew, that makes me think of tom cruise, which makes me think of him jumping on oprah's couch. and we don't like to talk about that here. so instead i will say, "a+"! but that makes me think of school, and it is the weekend, so we don't like to talk about that here, either. gosh, is there a reason that there isn't a way to say "good job" without being reminded of something terribly disturbing? well...i guess i could always just say "good job." so, um, good job, nicky g! (why do i think this much about these things?) anyway. futuristic classics! right! on the far left and far right, updated versions of quilting. the texture on the nude dress reminded me of doilies or lace napkins, and a simple wool sweater was brought into the future with bright green, sort of geometric threading (which really makes me think of that one lily pad game from zoombinis . in a good way!) the shoes (which were totally killer) were the greatest indication of this - oxfords or loafers or a wood-looking material elevated with geometric shapes and of what looked like minerals (and whose patterns and colors reminded me a lot of snood . why is this collection the summary of our family computer's activity from the years 2002-2005?) the closing looks were words. lots of em. some looked like newspaper or tabloid headlines, and some were in electric clock fonts. in a few looks, they were attached to and appeared to be pouring out of the skinny-legged pants, and in others, were printed on ninja star-shaped marshmallows held together by their corners. i couldn't figure out what this was getting at, but have a feeling it has to do with bringing communication to a new medium. ha. yeah, that's all i got. as a look, i dig it, though. there were then pieces that weren't so obviously on the same wavelength as the collection's concept when broken down, but still felt just as modern. palettes from spring were updated , grey coats like the one below were simple as silhouettes but calmly assertive. same goes for the textural pants mixed with humble striped sweaters. also? that dress next to the lil orange number? needs to be styled with sheer rodarte aw10 pants? because it would look pretty and what i say goes? good. 
Male: 82%, Female, the dune itself is the tallest in the uae at over 300 meters, and the grade of the hill is roughly 50 degrees. sharp, huh?the turbocharged engines themselves costs $90,000 usd and up, and some drivers watch that $90,000 go up in flames. going...going...gone!the driver in the shot above slowly reversed down the dune, and got out unscathed. this driver was not so lucky.he rolled forward a couple of times up the hill, and then, after watching the video on youtube, he rolled what looked to be about 18+ complete turns down to the bottom of the hill.through the grapevine we are told that the driver did not survive. if any readers can provide additional information, that would be helpful.you can read more about the liwa festival and the mureeb challenge in this article by the national. as mentioned in a previous post, it does rain in the desert. november-february tend to be the wetter months, but random storms are known to occur outside of the 'winter' months. i snapped these shots several weeks ago (using my mobile camera) when the uae was hit with a series of rainstorms that our storm sewers simply couldn't accommodate. i was on my way home from work, and couldn't believe the amount of standing water.later that same evening, there was so much water in the khalidiya part of town that parked sedans were victims of the 'wake' caused by moving traffic. many of them had water splashing midway up the door.my students reacted to the rain much the way kids in the u.s. respond to snow. they were happy to dance around and enjoy it while it lasted
Female: 100%, Male,  during my trip to australia in october-november, i visited a few different places but melbourne was the place that i stayed in between and also spent the rest of my trip. most people who have been there would know about the unpredictable weather. i don't really like the cold weather but the temperatures in melbourne were not as damn cold as hanoi because the humidity is quite low. this trip i feel was very special as it was the second time and i was invited out for dinner a lot by my friend's relatives. i was a bit lazy after the trip and with the blogging. but, once again, i would like to thank them all in this post. i may have missed out someone and please forgive me. i would like to show my special appreciation to liz, mark's mother who took care of me for most of the time when i was in melbourne and also joined the beautiful trip to tassie. liz also arranged quite a few different parties to welcome, farewell and for other reasons. i really enjoyed her famous lasagne , one of the best dishes i've had. sarah and chris' family is the second to thank as i went to their house many times for dinner. sarah is a great cook and she can use her talents to cook even the left overs into a beautiful meal. i was really impressed about her food and her food's presentation. i enjoyed your food and great company of your family especially harvey, eden and rosie. they are gorgeous. the third family is catherine's, liz's sister. yes, i love your old house and the greek meal which reminded me heaps about greece and was a nice way to remember meeting cathy and her family in santorini in 2008. the grilled lamb, salad and dessert was delicious. thanks alot for the great evening and funny stories about the melbourne cup and nana. just loved it !!! emma, mark's cousin, and her friend bec travelled around vietnam at the end of 2008 and this was such a great chance to catch up again and remind each other about some funny stories about riding on the back of the motorbike and being a bit drunk at parties. thanks emma, sam, luke, gerry, damian and their friends that gave me a memorable dinner with beautiful food and wine. sam is such a gentlemen and really loved his design of the house. megan, yes, how can i forget about you:). thanks for the bbq and great time with your friends. lisa was very nice and hilarious plus the special discount i got from her work. i do appreciate it very much. also i would like to thank john who allowed me to stay down there in anglesea. i can't believe how quickly angus and myee have grown up. i was very impressed about your family's zoo. john freaked me out when he showed me the huge lizard. very warm family atmosphere!!!! special memory for me was the lady with the saucy beige hair, that's nana. i love her hair color and her old house. it was really nice seeing nana again and spending time at crown but hope we are luckier next time. thanks all once again for having me and giving me such a great time and looking forward to seeing you again very soon. i spent two weeks in phu quoc and everything seemed perfect with great weather and beautiful food, especially the seafood. but as always, there were some issues that came up i went out for lunch on one particular day, walking along the beach just up from the bungalows we stayed at to try to have some different food instead of going into town. unfortunately, it was a mistake to choose the lien hiep thanh hotel and restaurant right on the beach. i ordered grilled squid with salt and chilli, spring rolls and sour broth with tuna. it sounded great as these are specialist dishes from phu quoc and most places i've been they had been so nice and yummy. well, they served us boiled squid instead of grilled and i told the waiter that it was not what we ordered in a polite way but he denied it, telling me this is their restaurant's grilling technique. i was a bit upset and i ended up taking it back to the kitchen myself and they promised to make a new dish for me. ten minutes later, the same plate came back with the half bitten piece of squid. i couldn't say a word as they were so hopeless and they waiter tried to make a joke but it turned out all stupid. the sour broth with tuna which should be great as it's simple to make was tasteless, the tuna wasn't cooked enough and, if that wasn't enough, the spring rolls tasted like they were from the super market. totally sucked down there at the lien thanh!!!! no tip and worst meal of my life. on another point, i was expecting the food at the night market to be cheap but it didn't work that way. most restaurants at the night market were more expensive than restaurants in town and in the hotel. a prawn cost $4, 4 pieces of squid cost $5, a pice of tuna cost $5. hello!!! this is phu quoc, an island where you can catch fish anywhere. yesterday we wanted to find something different for breakfast after tennis. after wandering around, we stopped at a chicken and duck noodle and salad stand. we ordered one bowl of vemicelli with chicken and one noodle soup with chicken. we thought that'd be ok and cheap but the lady kept asking us about our order and confusing us. other people in the restaurant are shaking their heads. i didn't really understand if their reaction meant that they knew her or what? anyway, we ended up with two bowls of vemicelli with chicken and it costs 150,000vnd. i couldn't say a thing, i was so shocked. i couldn't believe my ears. i thought she's probably going to say it's new year which is a common excuse to rip tourists off. she didn't say anything. we just had to accept her price! i told people from the hotel and they thought i was joking. this really pisses me off and this is not the first time as well. my friends invited me to have dinner at a thai restaurant in vincom tower a few weeks ago. it was the weekend and it was really crowded, full of smoke and noisy. we could hardly hear our conversation unless we spoke very loud, almost shouting. we ordered chicken soup, prawn soup, mango salad, stir fried mixed vegetables, french fries, stir fried corn and finished with a hot pot. we always order too much and we couldn't finish all of the food. i really like the mango salad as the mango was very fresh and a bit spicy and the rest of our food wasn't too bad but they use a bit too much coconut milk in the soups. like many vietnamese, my friends didn't enjoy that much as they thought it was too spicy, sweet and fatty. they were right about some of that but i tried to explain to them about thai food always being spicy. we didn't have a good time and i don't think i would recommend this restaurant to anyone as there are plenty of nice thai restaurants in town which are not that expensive. we spent over 1.7 million dong on our meal for 5 of us which is about $95. as some of my good friends went back home during my birthday in december, i decided to celebrate instead in january. we prepared italian winter food as the winter weather was still around but unluckily, the weather changed on the day to such a beautiful sunny and quite warm day. we even had to switch on the air-conditioning, which is really unusual for hanoi at this time of the year. we served some cheese, bread, marinated mushrooms and wine to welcome everyone and for the dinner, we cooked italian soup called minestrone, roasted chicken with with lemon zest, olives and tomatoes. for the side dishes, we cooked roast potatoes, and made a beetroot salad and pan-fried asparagus with parmesan cheese. thanks to my good friends for coming and making it such a great fun night. i am in phu quoc, the place to be!!! this is my second time here but i feel like i know this place very well. the people i met last time, from the hotel staff to the people who live around, are all still here. they are gorgeous with smiling faces and so sweet. we're staying at the thanh kieu resort , the same place i stayed last time. i was lucky enough to get a room here as i booked way in advance as i heard some people couldn't get a room or had to pay lots of money for due to tet holiday. this is the first time i am not going home for tet. i just want to do something different as i've been home every year for the last 8 years. i also want to spend sometime here to relax and enjoy myself. i do love my city but i went home last month to visit my family and my mother seemed happy with my decision. the weather in phu quoc is so beautiful compared to the freezing cold in hanoi and it makes me feel so great. i am going to go to the beach to relax for the first few days and read a bit then off to the city for dinner at the night market which has the best food in town and really cheap!!!! they're cooking fresh seafood in the phu quoc style which is a bit different compared to other cities in vietnam. i will eat all of my favorites, especially stir fried crab with tamarind sauce. my mouth is watering now just thinking about it!!! happy tet every one and see you in the next few posts. i was walking through the old quarter yesterday and saw so many young people sitting along dinh liet street eating snails. i have to say that snails have never been on my list of must eat things as i had trouble a few years ago when i ate some snails at the old man restaurant in to ngoc van street in west lake. i had a stomach upset for 3 days in the row after eating snails on that occasion. i told myself that i shouldn't look but i actually did look and wanted to try them again. i ordered two bowls of two different kinds and also asked the waitress to give me lots of ginger and chiili. these snails don't actually have any special flavors at all but the dipping sauce which includes fish sauce, ginger, chilli and lemon is what makes the dish special. while i was sitting there trying to finish the two bowls i occupied myself by watching people walk past and by taking photos of this dish. i hoped that eating lots of ginger and chilli would help to protect my stomach. by now, after 24 hours, i am still ok and i wouldn't mind going back again. if you have lots of time to spend, this is such a good place as it's cheap and a great location. it's pretty exciting for me when i'm able to get down to saigon for a few days to see my dentist and visit my sister. it's nice to be in the sun and eat my favorite food from the south. food in the south is getting dearer but it's well cooked, fresh and tasty and worth the money. after i visited my dentist, my sister took me out for dinner with her family and our nephew by the river. we had a such a beautiful meal there, ordering coconut salad with chicken skin, stir fried duck eggs with tamarind sauce, fried rice with eggs and garlic, stir fried beef served with vegetables, pine apple and fresh noodles, and the last dish was thai hopot. they're all really tasty and the bill came out amazingly cheap. the next day, my niece's boyfriend invited everyone out for breakfast and we chose to go to lam son beef steak restaurant. it sounds funny to have a beef steak for breakfast but this is a common thing to do in the south. we had a mixed beef steak which includes fried egg, ham and french fries. it's surprisingly nice and the place is generally really crowded. good to eat something different instead of chicken noodle soup - pho ga - all the time :). in the evening, my nephew took everyone out to have keo fish hotpot which is one of my local favorite even though i am not really into river fish. we ordered some grilled river prawns, grilled keo fish, grilled squid and keo hotpot. we were totally full after all and i couldn't even move. it's really nice being with family especially as i'm very close to my sister and my nephew. it's good to see them again and i will be back here briefly at tet after my trip to phu quoc. looking forward to that! 
Female: 100%, Female, the culprit, circle side in... we haven't taken it out to play yet, but i'm sure we will soon. that means sooner or later a 'jeep' post will be in the future! probably later than sooner, because it's not broke in yet. but when that day comes, you'll know! i left out the details on this post &amp; just wanted to get back into the swing of things. i miss you all &amp; look forward to new adventures in this new year!.......sooner than later....... just a quick note to let you know i have been a little busy lately. in october, my laptop with all my saved pictures decided not to work anymore, (i did buy a new one), so it has been hard for me to write on the blog. most people have put their motorcycles away for winter, so riding has been limited also. i miss riding &amp; writing and will be back at this a.s.a.p!it is the holidays and things have been crazy for everyone, i'm sure. from my family to yours ~happy holidays~ view larger mapas most of you already know, i bought a new camera and needed an excuse to use it, so on saturday october 31st we headed out for a ride. as you can tell from the map, it wasn't a long ride, but we cruised the many curves and made it an all day event anyway.we stopped in hornitos (which is a very small community) to use the facilities and wet our whistle. check out this antique cash register that is still in use!as we were gettin
Female: 100%, Female, just a quick post to let you all know that st vincent's op shop&nbsp; (10 costas drive, hoppers crossing) are open on sundays from 11am (not too sure it could be 10am) to 3 pm. this is the only op shop, that i know of, which is open on sundays and their items are still reasonably priced! do you know of any other op shops that are open on sundays? if so do tell! till next time... vf p.s. i'm holding my first ever giveaway! make sure you enter at http://www.vintagefokus.blogspot.com/ before i became a stay at home mum, i worked in south melbourne. i would visit the emerald hill op-shop at least once a week and found quite a few bargains over the years. i dropped in when i was last in south melbourne, which i think was some time last year. the shop had changed and it was quite pricey. i found this movie on abc iview all about the ladies that have run the shop for years. you can see an excerpt here. an unexpected op shop visit to the red cross shop in the mall in oakleigh yielded this pretty floral sheet for $5. i'm going to use it for fabric - i've already created a lined wrap skirt for my etsy shop, and there's still quite a bit left to make something else. vinnies in crewe street, oakleigh, is great for books. au revoir by mary moody (once a presenter on gardening australia) made me want to run away to france, too (mind you, i'd run away to almost anywhere i'm so keen to go travelling again!). the red book is a great basic guide to knitting, in the pelham craft series (i have another of these on soft toy making) and published in 1973. it might actually encourage me to learn a couple of new stitches and make something other than socks and scarves! each of these was a mere $1. i did a spot of op-shopping this weekend and found this gorgeous retro print of a little boy and his dog standing in the rain. i think it is a “kitsch” type of print but i’m just guessing from what little research i’ve done on the net . it is very “vintage” and i thought it would be a perfect addition to the nursery – not to mention too cute to pass on. http://www.vintagefokus.blogspot.com/ there is a run of good opshops along this road. vinnies, the salvos, and another which supports a local charity. i dropped into each of them yesterday while i was over that side of town (i'm not often over there), and bought these few items: wrist watch marked at $20, i paid $10. the metal on the band of my old watch has gone strange, kind of gritty, and is uncomfortable against my skin, so i thought it was about time for a new one. i like plain clear faces on watches, with numerals instead of dots, so this is ideal. the salvos were having a 'everything is half price' day, otherwise i might not have paid $20 for it. this is one of those cards that has digital sound when you open it - this one being kookaburras laughing. they are one of my favourite birds, so for $4 i grabbed it, just for fun. i've been looking for something cool to swan around the house in on hot days, and would have preferred cotton, but it is very hard to find 100% cotton clothes these days, so i settled for this shift thingy for $6. i've lost some of these hooks from our curtains over the years, and have never got around to replacing them, so when i saw a box of these for 20c each, it was finally time to fix those darn curtains! i'd arranged to meet friends for coffee, and they said if they weren't in the cafe, they'd be in the opshop nearby, and sure enough, that's where they were. i'd been in the same shop two days ago, but for a small shop they have a fast turnover, and there is always new stuff! i found this really ugly blouse for $1, with pretty machine embroidered xmas motifs on it. when i got home, i cut out the motifs and cut off the buttons. the rest of the shirt is in hubby's rag bag. somebody had apparently been to the usa and bought a heap of souvenir cloth badges, but never got around to sewing them on to articles of clothing. i'll be cutting them up to embellish fabric postcards, atcs, or other patchwork. 40 cents each. i love anything with peacocks, so i wasn't going to leave this little brass dish beind - 50 cents! there was a basket full of laces for $1 a roll, so i grabbed these to share with a friend in the usa who loves laces. the lady at the counter said "oh that lace has been going out the door today!" and i wondered what else i'd missed out on! these finds are from a trip to frankston in december, to take advantage of one of saver's half price garment mondays. there are enough op shops in the main shopping area to make a day trip a worthwhile exercise - i think i visited five, including savers. above are a jumper and cardigan which i intend to deconstruct for the yarn. you can't ever have too much yarn :) the purple cardi has giant snaps down the front, which i'll also reclaim and repurpose. i'd priced snaps about this size in the haberdashery section a while back and they retail for at least $1 each, and i have six of them now. both knits were two or three dollars each. a large scarf featuring a gorgeous print of horses. i tried to convince the checkout operator that scarves are apparel, but apparently they're considered accessories and not included in the half price offer. still a bargain at $3.95, i think. i may turn this one into a halter top, if i can bear to cut it. a cowboy motif doona cover that i'll use as fabric. i couldn't resist the cute print. enough here to make a shirt, a skirt and still have some left over. can't remember the price exactly, but it was about $5. a gorgeous green caftan, for me to wear in the heat. cool and comfortable now that i've altered it to my satisfaction: it was a little tight over the rack of doom, so i let it out at the side seams only to find that this rendered it rather shapeless in other areas. so i added a couple of waist ties to tie at the back and now i love it. $9 at savers. an "eight wives of henry the viii" tea towel, to be refashioned into a tote bag. $1.95. (edited: obviously that was meant to be "six wives of henry viii" - i think melbourne's hot and muggy spell has damaged my brain) an isle of wight tea towel, also to be refashioned into a tote bag. also $1.95. both tea towels from savers. on the same trip, i also bought ten balls of black mohair yarn, at $1 a ball in st vinnies, plus a set of dominoes for $2 in another op shop (can't remember which, memory failure due to hot weather). like i wrote earlier, can't have too much yarn! the dominoes are intended for a jewellery project i have in mind, and they came in a little wooden box that i'll use for something else. a good day. i would love to read about it if you did. i'd love to go on a trip like that, but i really don't need to...i do my own opshop tours without any help, lol. popped into the local brotherhood shop again today and found these goodies. it really is a neat little shop, they always seem to have new stuff coming in, and put it on the shelves within minutes of receiving and pricing it! they are just down the road from me; too close really....i can't resist dropping in when i walk by ;-) this cotton hand embroidered cloth was 40 cents. i've got hundreds, but this is so beautifully stitched, i couldn't leave it behind for that price. i fell in love with this enamel brooch for $4, thinking i would use it to embellish a crazy patchwork block, but when i got it home and had a closer look, i decided no, it's too good for that, so it's in my jewellery box. here is the brooch again, with a bead necklace for 50 cents. i would normally not have looked twice at that, but have a look at the top i was wearing today - perfect match!! 
Male: 100%, Male,  i was going over what i was writing about the bullpen when compared with last season, and unfortunately i don't think i can make a comparison until opening day. i have no idea, outside of the mainstays (k-rod, feliciano, parnell), who will be on the roster. the short summary is that i was pumped for the 8-9 combo of putz and k-rod last season, bullpens are notoriously unpredictable year to year, and ambiorix burgos may have killed someone with his car. as of now, i'm not even all that certain who the fifth starter will be. the team seems intent on having that be either niese or nieve, but neither is pitching like they want the job (at least not when compared to misch and figueroa). so, my bullpen summary will be postponed until next month, when i have a clue as to the composition. that being said, there are some position battles that the organization are ignoring because they arose out of injury. shortstop: jose reyes and his overactive thyroid has opened an every day job for alex cora. cora is a known commodity, which is one of my favorite backhanded compliments. i'm no expert with major league playing time and minor league options, but i'd like to see tejada man the spot. he's hitting well enough right now, and i'm not sure how much that counts in spring, but its better than not hitting at all. i'm not sure the mets want to do that, but i think it's time we start looking at developing this kid, especially when i hear his defense and speed are major-league ready. centerfield: poor gary matthews, jr. what am i saying? rich gary matthews, jr. whatever you call him, he's the odd man out in the cf battle. the job looks like it will go to pagan, who, if he realizes his upside, could be a known commodity. i know everyone will have terror flashbacks when they think of fernando martinez's cup of coffee last season, but he's tearing the cover off the ball now. again, this is spring training, so it may not be worth much, but maybe he carries that over into the start of the season. i think manuel should take a good look at f-mart to start the season. i know these are temporary position battles, but i think that's all the more reason to go with youth. let's get some young energy out there. who knows when beltran returns, and what the condition of his knee is? and with reyes, i'm certainly no endocrinologist. here’s my problem with john maine. i think we’re all getting sick of his tired act. it’s becoming the ‘same ole story’ with this guy. after following johan santana's 4-inning gem with a disaster, this is what he had to say: "my mechanics felt fine...i just wasn't kind of that into it. it wasn't good. it's just i wasn't all that prepared. the feeling that it's not my game is the hardest thing. it's a waste of a day." what the fuck is this guy doing on the mound if he's just not that into it? and claiming to be unprepared when you know exactly when you are going to pitch? i don’t get it, is it not your game because johan santana started it, it's spring training? suck it up guy and pitch. stop being a little bitch, that's what you get paid to do. enough of the sappy follow ups, we don't give a shit, just get it done. granted, there’s a lot of spring training left, and that’s great for john. he better use the time wisely to straighten himself out because i have news for john. if he comes out of the gate stumbling and struggling, his tired nice guy act is not going to fly for too long. he is now two years removed from his stellar 15-10 season, his only full season in the majors. so this season becomes very important for john to prove his worth. our patience is thin to begin with and there are other guys chomping at the bit that have the ' cojones ' to take his place. here are possible suitors ready to pounce on maine's job. you have hisanori takahashi who is a veteran student of the game, can start and has been lights out. jonathon niese is in line for the 5 th starters' spot, if he doesn ’t win that job, he can steal maine's. nelson figueroa, who no one is talking about, hasn ’t given up an earned run yet. then there's fernando nieve and jenrry mejia. i don't think nieve is the answer, and hopefully mejia will start the year in the pen. but you catch my drift here, there are options if maine sucks again. if not any of the above, mets have stated that financially, they can take on more salary via a trade or what not. john maine just isn't that into you [nbc] only the mets…unbelievable! mets say jose reyes has an overactive thyroid. jose reyes is saying: "los especialistas que me atendieron en nueva york me dijeron que estaba bien y que no tengo problemas de la tiroide" "me dijeron que solamente tenía la garganta inflamada y no necesitaba medicinas para la tiroide u otra cosa" "la única recomendación de los especialistas fue que no comiera mariscos por la cantidad de yodo que contienen y que debía chequearme cada tres semanas para ver como sigue todo" translation: “the specialists that attended me in new york told me that i’m fine and that i don’t have thyroid problems. they told me that i just had throat inflammation and that i don’t need medication for thyroid or anything else. the only recommendation the specialists gave me is to not eat fish due to high iodine it contains and to get checked out every three weeks to see how things are going.” anyone see jay horowitz? jay horowitz anyone? jay, are you there? what does this man get paid to do? besides that good for nothing pr moron, you have to just scratch your head and say, “what the fuck? who’s smoking crack here?” it’s got to be one of the following. either reyes is lying, or he didn’t understand the doctors. or are the mets being overly stupidly cautious to lie due to them being scared shit that god forbid something happens to reyes if he starts playing and this problem pops up again? see past. this is just getting stupid now. maybe fathead jay horowitz will make an appearance. diagnóstico diferente de reyes y mets [espn deportes] welcome to "in memoriam." a segment where we take a moment to celebrate, castigate, and otherwise reminisce on former mets both good and evil. this edition: the kid, gary carter, and his outrageous new twitter feed! it wasn’t too long ago when gary carter went a little looney on us. early in 2008, with willie randolph on the chopping block, carter sounded off with a 'pick me i'm available' public pitch to manage the mets. "i just want them to know of my availability. i'm only a phone call away because my contract allows me to leave the ballclub. i could be in new york tomorrow, if necessary, because if there's anything at the major league level i can leave this job." carter, being the manager of the orange county flyers of the independent golden league in california at the time, of course recanted after the firestorm he created. "i want to clear this up especially...i never wanted to try to undermine or do anything to bring this to a situation where i'm trying to campaign for something...i would love to get back to the big leagues as a coach, possibly a manager. i would love that opportunity. [but] i wish willie well." interestingly enough, he also did this in 2004 when art howe was taking up space in the dugout. but hold on to your shorts, the kid is back and rawer than ever on his new twitter feed - gary carter raw . we've heard about athletes, celebrities, and even the president taking to twitter. here comes gary carter, spewing outrageous thoughts on everything from fucking single moms, dykstra and the bathroom blow jobs, to kevin mitchell being a snitch, and everything in between. here's a taste: "dave magaden was lactose intolerant. but that didn't stop him from fucking long island cows on the daily" on centerfielder-turned-bernie-madoff-accompice lenny dystra: "when clubs got boring, we'd tell bouncers a homo kid with a mullet was offering bj's in the mens room. they'd grab dykstra, he'd fight back" on current angels manager mike sciocia: "little known fact...the retard in the movie "leaving las vegas" that rapes elizabeth shue in the ass was mike scioscia, and he was not acting" dropping a dime on former teammates: "sid fernandez and i coached a little league team in crown heights just to fuck single moms" "its no surprise kevin mitchell left the team... he was a fucking snitch" "i caught matt williams jerking off while listening to sinbads comedy tape on his walkman. weird thing was i caught him in will clark's trunk" "steve sax seat on the bench was warmer than robin yount's wife's beard!" "i did a short stint as a "coyote" south of the border...i still technically own rafael santana and his family" need we say more? this is truly a must-follow for mets fans on twitter (twitter.com/garycarterraw). gary, you are a fucking genius, please continue to entertain us. carter apologizes for comments saying he wanted mets' job [mlb] lizzie grubman and her power girls would have never let this happen. in fact, had they done the job, there would not be any complaints about the abstructed view seats at citi field. they would have the skill to convince fans that obstructed seats are the new wave and that you aren't anyone unless you had an obstructed seat. so in citi field's inagural season, the mets, instead of letting fans know that the seats they were buying were somewhat obstructed, they hit the airwaves with a retarded statement. i'm still trying to decipher what this means. in a truly bizarre appearance on wfan, team executive david howard told fans that they didn't understand the nature of obstructed views because these seats merely had blind spots that meant you weren't able to see the entire field. huh? it was just one more example of a team battling poor pr with even worse pr. just as they refused to admit any mistakes with the medical staff or front office employees challenging minor leaguers to fights, they refused to admit that they made a mistake by not telling customers the whole story. now there will be a warning for fans buying obstructed view seats. are we seeing a change in pr policy? i doubt it as long as the current pr staff is in place. warning reads: view: limited portions of the playing field may not be visible from this seat location. mets stop being obstructionist about stadium obstructions [nbc] as i indicated last week, there is a reasonable expectation that the pitching will improve this season when compared to 2009. however, there are several reasons to expect that improvement to be marginal (though i expect it to be significant). the offense, on the hand, is another matter... following is the projected lineup comparison (once beltran returns from knee surgery). 2009 opening day lineup 1. jose reyes - ss 2. daniel murphy - lf 3. carlos delgado - 1b 4. carlos beltran - cf 5. david wright - 3b 6. ryan church - rf 7. brian schneider - c 8. luis castillo - 2b 2010 projected lineup 1. jose reyes - ss 2. luis castillo - 2b 3. carlos beltran - cf 4. jason bay - lf 5. david wright - 3b 6. jeff francoeur - rf 7. daniel murphy - 1b 8. rod barajas - c let's go by order in the lineup and see what improvements we can expect from this year's team. 1. obviously, we need more than the 36 games we got last year from reyes. oddly, he may start the season in the three slot (this is more apparent after yesterday's spring training game), which has arguable merit. the leadoff spot was manned best in reyes' absence by angel pagan until he got hurt. pagan is my odds-on favorite to win the cf job and get the leadoff slot should manuel decide to bat reyes third until beltran returns. assuming one month of pagan and the rest of the season with reyes, this slot can't help but be a significant improvement over last year. 2. murph was overhyped coming out of spring last season. also, the sky is blue, the president is black, and elmer fudd has problems with the letter "r". on the opposite end, i don't know that we could have expected any less from castillo. i'd take a repeat of last year from castillo as the perfect no. 2 slot season (and word is, he's lost more weight and is in better shape this year). 3. carlos delgado just had hip surgery - no, not that surgery, this is a new one. i'm sad for him, in part because i thought we could take a late flyer on him with an incentive-laden deal and he could wrestle the job from murph. before he got hurt, he was the only guy hitting moon shots to right at citi cavern. i think we've seen the last of delgado, in any uniform. odds are we'll see reyes for a month in this slot and then beltran for the balance of the season. again, nowhere to go but up. 4. bay jumps into a slot that was best manned last year by... wait for it... gary sheffield. yes, that gary sheffield, who if he lands a job this spring will have played in four different decades. bay has his issues, and maybe the back end of this contract will be ugly, but for now he replaces what we thought we'd get from delgado last year, but from the right side. he will certainly be an improvement over murph in left and is a .380 obp guy who slugs over .500 and plays every day. 5. which david wright will we get this year? the guy who had his worst season as a pro, or the all-star we had for the previous four seasons. i remember arguments about who you'd take first to start a team - wright or pujols (now that argument is mauer or pujols). wright's anemic power may have been the result of little protection, adjustments to a new ballpark, girlfriend troubles, who knows... but, if you're so inclined, take a look at his numbers last year. ignoring the low homerun total, it wasn't all that bad a year. in fact, it was a pretty good year (144 games, 80+ runs, 70+ rbis and a .390 obp). expect his slugging to improve some, pujols to be caught on the juice and the argument to be mauer vs. wright. 6. this is the most underrated position upgrade on the team. church was a aaaa player. francoeur may not live up to the promise he showed in his early years as a brave, but he has good pop, plays great defense in right (he has a sick cannon) and is a takes his lunchpail kind of guy. i wish he'd learn to take a walk, but if you look at his numbers as a met last year (.311 ba, 10 hr, 40 r, 41 rbi in 75 games), there's proof the change of scenery worked. 7. i'm not a fan of murph. keith hernandez is working with him on his defense. thoughts are he'll platoon with tatis. maybe jacobs will win the job. this is a hole, but on opening day last year we had schneider. i'm hoping for midseason upgrade here - maybe dunn, or even keith if he wants to put the uniform back on. 8. barajas plays defense, hits homeruns and doesn't get on base much. he can throw folks out, which will be fun. also, it's looking like blanco will be santana's caddy, and i think that can help. ok, so the seventh and eighth slots are problems. still, we have reason to expect way more out of this offense than last year, even if there are some injuries. that leaves us with the bullpen... you have to look way back to find mets team that had great team chemistry. not that it’s been bad with the recent mets, but it definitely has not been great. a key component to a winning team, you can’t buy chemistry. as a gm, putting a team together based on skills, stats, and baseball attributes is tough enough. when you add in the layer of evaluating players’ personalities in a quest to create a team that will get along besides playing great baseball, there’s no clear formula to success. gm’s will target players that will help their club, and besides the few troubled players that some teams will stay away from for the fear of bringing in a ‘cancer’ to the locker room a la milton bradley, chemistry seems to fall under the radar most often than not when making these major investments. when the mets picked up ‘frenchie’ jeff francoeur, the last thing that factored into the decision was his personality. as long as he didn’t kill any teammates or coaches in the past, the mets were bringing him to queens so they can rid themselves of church. the mets never thought anything to the effect of, “this guys great in the clubhouse, lets find a way to get him”. well what do you know, frenchie has brought some life to this team. lets hope it translates to chemistry, which will at least give mets fans some quality baseball to watch again. the last time i can truly say i saw a mets team with great team chemistry, you have to look back to the days of ron darling, tim teufel and co., causing havoc in some honky tonk texas bar. that was team chemistry at its finest, you just sensed it. everyone hated them, outside of ny that is, but they had fun, played great together, and had each others backs no matter what. it was also the last time the new york mets won the championship. now we haven’t seen any hotfoots out of frenchie, but he’s becoming a social leader on the team. along with newcomer, jason bay, they set up a viewing party for the u.s. v canada gold medal hockey game sunday. according to frenchie, mets can expect more social gatherings this year. our first trip this year is to colorado, and we have a monday night off. guys can go out all day. but we should go out together at night. let's go have a ball. as a player, these types of things make the clubhouse a more comfortable place to be in and a place they want to play in. lets give credit where credit is due, mets received a huge intangible with frenchie at a low cost. gold-medal chemistry builder for mets [mlb] as spring approaches, i always get optimistic. now that it looks like, save for the possible addition of a left-handed reliever, the roster is set, i can start to analyze what it is we have at each position. first, lets take a look at what all of sports radio, and every fan i talk to, says needed to be addressed this offseason - starting pitching. let's look at the projected rotation vs. last year's spring projection. 2009 projected starting rotation 1. johan santana 2. mike pelfrey 3. oliver perez 4. john maine 5. tim redding / livan herandez 2010 projected starting rotation 1. johan santana 2. mike pelfrey 3. oliver perez 4. john maine 5. jon niese / fernando nieve / nelson figueroa et al. what a difference a year makes? one through four are the same, and last year's depth is now this year's unaddressed problem. the common theory goes: "you know you get with johan (even though he's coming off elbow surgery), but 2, 3 and 4 are all head cases." pelfrey regressed in an alarming manner, and you have to hope he'll bounce back in some way. in flashes during the 2008 season, he looked like a legitimate no. 2 starter. ollie p is a head case, but also has been a big game pitcher for the mets in the past (and still has electric stuff when focused). perhaps i would have rather signed randy wolf to a one-year deal, and no way was ollie worth three years a $12 million per, but we was coming off two pretty good seasons with the mets, especially 2007. there was no reason to expect such a miserable 2009, and while many feel he was shut down due to a phony injury, people don't have surgery on phony injuries. john maine was obviously still hurt, and maybe we don't know what we'll get from him. while that is a lot of uncertainty, short of signing lackey or dealing for halladay (neither of which was realistic for the mets), there isn't much the mets could do this offseason to fix it. armes like marquis and pineiro don't move me much. where i might have taken a chance are high-risk, high-reward guys like sheets, wang and bedard. however, sheets price himself out, and wang and bedard may not pitch until deep into the season (without the help of the mets' crack medical staff). what we hope for here is a few less injuries. simply getting something close to 180 innings out of each of these guys will be a dramatic improvement over last season, especially because can't help but improve. tomorrow i'll discuss the projected lineup and the various improvements over last year. 
Male: 100%, Female, i am not ashamed to say that i am a dork. an internet geek. next to ella, my computer is my best friend. and it's one of the best friends a girl could have. it doesn't give me attitude; it would never leave me for another user; it wouldn't borrow money and then disappear. yes, i'm happy to say that our relationship is truly solid. that's not to say i haven't had some bad ones in the past, but ever since i got together with my mac, it's been pure bliss... as a quick aside, i happen to love the series of mac vs. pc ads created by apple. in case you aren't familiar with them, here's one (i chose one with a dog in it for the sake of blog relevancy) anyway, i hop into bed with mac every night. ella's not particularly happy to have to share the bed with him. she usually puts up a fight and tries to draw my attention away from his glossy screen by digging at the bed, climbing in my lap, or just plain barking in my face. yes, my little girl is the epitome of subtle and mature. but, as with most, ella can only hate on mac for so long before she realizes that, well, he's pretty freakin' cool. see for yourselves... don't be alarmed, folks. my mac is not growing an odd, furry appendage... ...nor has apple developed the technology to spawn animal hindquarters (at least, not to my knowledge)... that's just my ella finally letting go of her completely unfounded objections to mac... ...and feeling totally good about it. "ohhhhh, man....it never felt this good with pc." how many creatures do you imagine could squeeze into my little shoebox of an apartment? lord knows i've complained before about it being too small for ella and myself, so any more than two would certainly be a bad idea, right? well, for kicks, i decided to test that out labor day weekend when my parents (ella's grandfurma and grandfurpa) came to stay with me and also brought their 12 year old dog, jenna. "five living things coexisting in a tiny apartment for 36 hours" may not actually break any guinness world records , but i wonder if "five living things almost losing their minds while failing to peacefully coexist in a tiny apartment" would? ok well i should clarify that it was really the furry inhabitants that disturbed the peace. the drama began when i busted out the aerobed . ella is not a fan of self-inflation - that much was made clear as she ran to her protector (the toilet bowl) to get away from the weird blue rapidly growing monster that makes "ssssssssssssss" noises... of course, when faced with the choice of sleeping on the cold, hard bathroom floor, or cuddling with momma on the crazy bed, she demonstrated a miraculous recovery... of course, that is not to say that ella didn't try to recoup her spot on the real bed and tell grandma to bugger off... but the activity that caused all the humans in the shoebox to drink heavily and look for ways to pop the top off or bust through the sides or something was the incessant posturing between jenna and ella. momentarily fearful of the aerobed , they soon both decided to take it over. as you can see by their expressions, the take-over was not a joint effort and it would take a battle royale to determine who would ultimately become queen of the faux mattress. only ella doesn't truly battle over anything because she doesn't take anything seriously. yelling, lunging, barking, howling...all signs of play to my ella. dominance schmominance. territory? mi territory es su territory! no worries! let's just play! jenna's response? shut it, kid...i haven't played in years and i'm not about to start with you... in the end, i'd call it a draw. jenna and ella agreed to disagree and the humans parted ways with hugs and headaches. if i were a journalist, i'd surely be fired for being this late on a story. lucky for me, i'm not a journalist - i'm a blogger. and i've got puppy pics that are timeless in their adorability. i can even make up words like "adorability"...with this kind of freedom, why would anyone want to bother reporting on legitimate and current news? anyway, in case you hadn't heard, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the development of the original design plans for central park, the central park conservancy and the new york city department of parks &amp; recreation set up a hot air balloon ride for new yorkers and visitors alike to catch a bird’s eye view of the city and the park. the balloon was flying through august 22nd. sorry you missed it. if the site's still up, you can get more detail on it here . (but why bother...it's over and done...perhaps you should just scroll down to the cute puppy pics below since that's what you're here for anyway) strangely, dogs aren't weren't permitted on the balloon ride. perhaps it's too risky having all that fur flying around so close to the flames of the burner (although i bet the furminator could take care of that)...or maybe it's because the basket wasn't intended for quadrupeds, so allowing them would mean fewer riders per trip and less $$ in the balloon company's pocket (cue hard-nosed journalistic headline: "dogs keep aeroballoon's profits from reaching the sky")... honestly my biggest concern was that ella would have caught the urge to indulge her predatory bird instinct at 500 feet in the air. so we thought it best to admire the balloon from the safety of the ground at cherry hill . sorry i don't have any aerial shots for you, but aren't pics of ella with her tongue hanging out way cuter? enjoy. and here are some views of the balloon from the northwest side of the lake ... ella loves horses... almost as much as horse poop. (sorry - but it's true...that sh-- is like doggie catnip!) but while she might admire them from afar as they majestically trot through the park, she isn't too keen on them being all up in her water trough. only it's not technically ella's trough (try telling her that). this is one of the troughs along central park south dedicated to the carriage horses by the aspca . and the truth of the matter is that ella is too much of a diva to stick her head in and drink directly from the trough anyway. momma had to fill her portable plastic cup from the spigot like we do at all the other people-dedicated water fountains (momma's actually ok with that - if you saw how dirty that water was, you would be too). anyway, point is, ella was really lapping up that nice cold water in her clean personal cup when she came face to face with the one animal she has never (yet) tried to incite play with (thank god)... horse to ella: "you betta check yo'self." horse again to ella: "uh huh, that's what i thought." ella to horse: (mumbling under her breath) "oh come on this is getting ridiculous now. nobody needs that much water..." ella to herself: "ok that is it! i'm about to make my move if this horse doesn't trot on in 10 seconds." ella to momma: "momma are you sure you don't have any poland spring in your bag? i am so parched..." you might have noticed that i've been a bit light with the blog postings lately. i can't deny it - guilty as charged. but there are extenuating circumstances, i swear. i have proof. ladies and gentlemen, exhibit a. meet ella - the energizer puppy. if i didn't know better, i'd swear she was plugged into the wall somewhere because her energy just never seems to drain. it is my only mission in life to find something that will tire ella out so that momma can get a moment to relax (is one moment too much to ask for?). thankfully, i recently managed to find something that occupied ella for one evening (hey, i'll take it) - a puppy-sized stuffed toy creatively named "monkey". i owe monkey a great deal for this - he not only filled in as ella's playmate for an evening, but also provided priceless entertainment... ella was so excited to meet monkey that i didn't even have time to remove his tags and stickers before she pounced. ella shows monkey she ain't afraid of no primates. "yeah, a lot of good those opposable thumbs are doing you now, eh monkey?!!" "say uncle! say uncle!!" ella puts monkey in a head lock. he looks surprisingly comfortable. monkey tries to gain advantage by tickling ella - she laughs uncontrollably but won't relent. time out. like true competitors, in the end they lay down and snuggle and put the match behind them. (wait, that's not what nadal and federer did after the finals of wimbledon this year? hmm. humans are weird.) anyway, monkey succeeded in draining ella's batteries for a little while. the question in my mind is, who will take on ella next? because right now, momma is saying uncle. uncle!!! "oh, look!...is it a puppy?" "yes, she's not quite 8 months." "oh, she's beautiful. is she trained?" "um, how so? i mean, she housetrained but eh er uh..." silence. "she's a good girl - for the most part. she's just got a lot of energy." "well of course...she's a puppy! is she a chewer?" "definitely, yes, i'm going bankrupt buying bones to keep her mouth occupied!" "does she chew on your shoes?" "haha...well if there's no bone around, she's got to chew on something right?" -coughs, looks down at the ground out of embarrassment, scurries off- look, don't blame me! i'm clearly doing all i can to train ella properly. to ensure she chews only on designated toys and bones. to teach my furbaby the difference between a "good chew" and a "bad chew". are you saying there's some reason ella might think that because it's ok to chew on this toy... ...it's ok to chew on this too?... i don't see the connection. sorry. today was one of the most beautiful days we've had in nyc in a long time. perhaps it's the relative lack of humidity that's got me feeling so good...or maybe i'm deficient in vitamin d and the sunshine has replenished me...in truth i think i really owe it all to christopher cross. he's in my head, he won't leave, and i'm totally fine with it. as ella and i made our way around the conservatory water in central park, we both found ourselves smiling at all of the sailboats. for those of you who aren't familiar, the conservatory water is an ornamental boat pond of sorts where people can casually sail (or race - for the true sportsman or uptight new yorker) sailboats. it's a relaxing place to begin with, but the sailboats just add to the magic. and i couldn't help but set the whole scene to music - christopher cross's "sailing" . i think i kept the theme music mostly inside my head, though i can't deny there may have been some humming aloud during the chorus. now it's your turn to hum along... i recently relayed the news about ella gutting her beloved raffy. the loss was so sudden and shocking that i made the decision to keep raffy's remains around for as long as i could. sick, maybe...but with his stuffing fully gone, i figured he couldn't pose much of a threat to ella's digestive system, and frankly i really like raffy and am perfectly happy tossing his limp shell around the shoebox for ella to chase. earlier this evening, i noticed ella was hiding under my desk, shooting me a guilty look out of the corner of her eye. i knew immediately that meant she had something in her mouth that she knew damn well she ought not to. i pried open her jaws of steel, and a round, brown, mushy ball-shaped thing dropped into my hand. i screamed bloody murder at first, thinking it was part of a bodily organ of another animal she'd killed, or a piece of some kind of nasty that she'd snuck in from the mean city streets...in a few seconds though, my squeals turned to hysterical laughter as i realized what it was. ladies and gentlemen, exhibit a: and exhibit b: and exhibit c: ella's wrath directed toward raffy is relentless! the poor thing is now eviscerated and sans eye. if i had to venture a guess, i'd say ella will take the other eye next and then move on to his ear. i will say, though...i've never seen anything keep ella's attention quite so much as raffy's eye. perhaps i'll hold onto the eyes and use them as training treats. that might be a good, maximum incentive treat to use while we're practicing "come"...even filet mignon couldn't top a furry eyeball apparently. 
Female: 100%, Female, oh i hear ya...he's just a two year old how hard could it be?ah-ha, thought you'd never ask!here's just one example of what i've been going through...just the other day...i had to make a very important phone call. as the phone on the other end is ringing, i spotted madisen and asked her to run and see where jake was. ( as i know it only takes a second before he's into something.) "he's fine, kailey's going to play with him while your on the phone." , she said.approximately 20 minutes later i get off the phone, turn around, and see jake walking towards me waddling like a duck. he's covered from head to toe with paint, making paint footprints behind him. "look mommy, i paint!!" he said in a lovely shade of purple.i can only imagine the haunting shade of white my face became, as the shock rushed over me. i immediately grabbed him up and went running for the bath tub. screaming in panic for the girls to hurry and help, i went as fast as i could. "strip your clothes off, and what ever you do, do not let jake out of the tub!!"i knew wherever the paint was, time was of the essence to get it up. as i followed the painted footprints imprinted in the carpet. (of our rented house might i ad) i was led straight to the masterpiece corner! he had somehow managed to get open two containers of paint. one red &amp; one blue.(which were in a case and up high. obviously not high enough!)mr. man, had painted the walls, his toys, his bed, his bedding, and himself!
Male: 100%, Male,  "morning near black mesa", oil on panel, 8x10 inches jerry lebo , 2008 just a quick note to let you know how painting is going in new mexico. we are having a great time, painting everyday, and traveling around this beautiful state. the above small painting was based on a some photos i took the other day on the way to bandelier national monument . to get there you travel by highway through the san ildefonso and near the san juan pueblos. you can see it from miles around as you travel in the area. there is also another black mesa in the most northern part of nm--this one is only about a half our north of santa fe. it was early in the day when we passed by, and we stopped on the side of the highway and took some photos--and i made some color notations and a quick sketch. the mesa actually looks very dark most of the day--but in the early morning it takes on a pinkish/purple quality that was very compelling. i was reminded what a special place new mexico is the other day by two of my readers. cindy, who is one of my collectors, sent a comment on my last post--which reminded me of the uniqueness of the new mexico landscape--and how the skies here are somehow different. in fact, last year when we were here i wrote a post titled " top ten reasons for an artist to live in santa fe ". i re-read this post and say that the "number one reason" i cited for living in santa fe was "clouds". and, i still think the clouds here are the most amazing you will see anywhere. in the morning, the sky here is usually very clear and blue, but when the clouds arrive later in the day, the show is often amazing--and worth the trip alone. i also got a nice note from jacqueline butler, welcoming me to new mexico. jacqueline is the artistic director for the organization " daily painters of new mexico ". she lives near galisteo and is thinking about starting a blog and is hosting a workshop for members. so, if you live in the area, drop her a note . especially if you want to become a daily painter here in nm. i have talked about my own personal views on "daily painting" in previous posts--and i fully support the concept. i just don't think it is for me, personally. my own view is that finding time for "daily painting", is more important than trying to make a painting a day. so there you go. i highly recommend a trip to new mexico to paint--or just to look around. i have been coming here for thirteen years now--usually once a year. and i am still inspired every time i visit. who knows, i may even move here one day. i have met many people who come here for business or some other reason--and fall in love and stay. but, even if you can't get here, you can do the next best thing. go to your studio and find an excuse to put a fantastic sky in one of your landscape paintings! all the best, sixtyminuteartist . "juniper view (study)", jerry lebo , 2008 oil on panel, 6x6 inches you have probably noticed it has been a while since my last post. several of my regular readers have sent me personal emails asking if something is wrong. i appreciate everyone’s concern, but i am okay—nothing terminal yet. as for the reasons behind my silence, the truth is that i have been dealing with some personal issues--and also have been busy at the day job—including two overseas trips. fortunately, this has not kept me out of the studio for the most part--and i have been continuing to try to move forward with my work. the important thing is that i am still painting—and keeping my “hour a day” minimum discipline. the main reason i have not been blogging is that i have not really had much to say. i usually need some sort of inspiration or something to share with my readers in order to get me started writing a post. i don't want to bore people with my random thoughts. to be honest, i have also been struggling with which direction to take my art. the last few large "color space" painting i finished are sitting around my studio and pushing me to make another one. but, to tell the truth, i have been feeling like doing some small paintings. i am also torn a bit about how to balance my normally "painterly" style against the more graphic approach of my most recent paintings. i realize now that my “style” is something that took me many years to develop--and i am not sure i should simply throw it out. on the other hand, i still very interested in the ideas i have been pursuing in my recent work. so, why am i posting today? well, i have a perfect excuse to do some small paintings—and share some ideas with you. we are on vacation in santa fe, nm for the next three weeks, and am working with my "portable studio", which is made by open boxm . i have written about the traveling setup i use for painting in past posts, and it is ideal for small paintings and studies. so i though i would post a few of these small paintings as they come off the easel over the next few weeks, as well as share some of my tips for painting when traveling. so here is my first travel tip. when traveling, i recommend you try painting on panels—instead of canvas. first, because panels are easy to pack, and you can buy them at most art stores these days. most airlines are adding baggage charges for weight and second bags these days—and i managed to fit all my clothes and painting supplies for three weeks into one suitcase. you can also make your own panels when you get to your destination from supplies available most places ( i did a post that shows you how ). in fact, unless you are planning to paint big paintings—panels are the way to go in my mind. on the other hand, if you are set on canvas, i have found the best approach is to pack a variety of stretcher bars (taped together) and ship a roll of canvas to where you are painting. that way, you only have to bring the bars, staple gun, and pliers on your flight. if you are bringing large stretcher bars, you are probably not going to be able to fit these in a suitcase, so that means some extra costs. when you stretch your canvas upon arrival ( i did a post on that too ), leave enough edge overlap so as to be able to un -stretch your work. that way you can simply roll it up and take it home in a mailing tube when you leave. okay, so there is a few tips for painting when traveling. for my current trip i decided to use ampersand gessobord . these panels are a bit more expensive than the ones i make at home, but not as expensive as some of the others out there. i started using these in my studio about 8 months back—and i am totally addicted. the surface is so nice and has just the right tooth for taking paint—and the quality and consistency is high. i am not paid to promote their products, but i can recommend them without hesitation . the panels come in various sizes (and you can cut them to size). these are widely available these days, so you have probably seen them at your local art store. so there you go, hope you get a chance to paint outdoors during the summer. and, maybe even get a vacation somewhere so you can paint something new. if so, i will be offering a few tips over the next few weeks—so stay tuned. all the best, sixtyminuteartist . "sweet escape", polymer on canvas, 50x50 inches jerry lebo , 2008 “i don’t paint pictures in hopes that people will understand them. they understand them, or not, according to their own capacity.” -- pablo picasso okay, so i decided to submit a couple of my recent large paintings to a regional juried exhibit up in fredrick, maryland . they wanted artists to submit the actual paintings, so it was a bit of a chore framing and then carrying three very large paintings (the largest was 50x60 inches) 30 miles to the venue. now the good/bad news, i found out that they accepted one of the paintings (the one in my last post, “these five words…”)--but rejected the others, "sweet escape" (above), as well as "dead heroes", the painting i put up two posts back. you are probably thinking, hey, you should be happy. you got a painting into a juried show, right? well, it gets better. so i go up on saturday to pick up the rejected paintings and haul them back to the studio--and when i get to the venue i find out that my artwork has been scattered around. one of the paintings is in a closet—with another painting leaning against it—which put a dent into the canvas. the other one is in an office, leaning against the wall behind a pile of other rejections. but, that wasn't the strangest part of it. the woman handing back the work had the "jury sheet" sitting there and was pleased to show me that the painting accepted into the show had a notation next to it...are you ready....it said, "maybe, if we have room". there you go--critical acclaim if i have ever heard it! i weakly made the point of saying, well, my paintings are rather large--so i understand if there was limited room (hoping for a bit more a positive response ), to which the woman replied, "oh, we have paintings in the show bigger than yours." thud. i tired again on the way out, “so have you given out awards yet.” you can guess the response—“oh, yes, they are all given out.” so, i am in the show, but barely--and definitely not the rapturous experience one hopes for. okay, so what is an artist to do in when faced with such a situation? the short answer is brush it off. get back in the studio as soon as possible and get painting again. i have seen artists send work to many galleries over the years, and most do not even get a polite rejection letter. getting a form letter can be an achievement. with a juried exhibit, politeness is probably the best you can hope for. even if you get your work into a group show or a gallery, you can expect that your work will be treated for what it is from a gallery perspective...a commodity—and i have heard of many cases where galleries have damaged work due to haphazard handling. other artists are your worst enemy, as they tend to treat other artist's work with little regard (if they are not looking). i am serious. if you don't believe me, watch what happens when artists bring their work to a critique or for submission to a juried show--if no one is looking, other artist will not hesitate to move your work or treat it in a very haphazard way. i have seen it. to a gallery, you are just one in a long line of eager artist to get their work shown, so don't be surprised if a gallery generally acts like you're work is replaceable . at least until it sells for $50 grand or so--they tend to get more careful at that point. i think my recent experience also shows some important points to take into account when you think about where and how to send your work out. first and foremost, it is important to find a gallery or event that is interested in work and represents similar artists and/or types of work. i wrote about this early in my blog . but it is worth repeating. if you are painting "cowboys and indians ", don’t send your work to a new york gallery—you won’t garner much interest. however, the good news is that they may be very excited in tuscon . in the end, you need to decide before sending out work if it is likely to appeal to a certain gallery or jurist. in my case, i think it was the fact that my paintings were so different from all the other painterly and more formal painting that was submitted to the show, that it simply did not fit with the show or what was running through the jurist's mind. you want a show that hangs well together--not necessarily to show every type or style submitted--even i can understand that. anyway, i thought i would share this experience, so you will be prepared. i know some of you are thinking about trying to break into galleries and submit your work to a show. if you are interested in reading more about how to better showcase your work and build your career as a visual artist, i will again recommend cay lang’s book, “taking the leap”. i have mentioned it several times in my blog, but it is a great book. i went back to reading it again after my recent experience, and i could quickly see some of the mistake i made in submitting work to the regional exhibit. first of all, as i previously mentioned, these types of modern, hard edge, “color space” paintings don’t really fit the style of the venue or the other art being shown there. so a tepid reception was probably inevitable. second, i don’t think they together really represent a cohesive artistic statement yet—since they are still evolving in terms of style and technique. this is not to say they are bad paintings, they are perhaps not quite ready for full public exposure or it was not the right venue. anyway, live and learn. i hope you got something out of my experience that will help you build your career as an artist. all the best, sixtyminutearist . "these five words in my mind" polymer on canvas, 60 x 50 inches jerry lebo, 2008 “the progression of a painter’s work, as it travels in time from point to point, will be towards clarity: toward the elimination of all obstacles between the painter and the idea, and between the idea and the observer.” --mark rothko i though this was a fitting quote for the above painting—and relates back to my own experience lately. as you know, i have making a radical change in my painting style over the last few months, and i have been getting a lot of questions as to “why”? the short answer can be found in the above quote—in that i felt a real need to simplify my work and eliminate the obstacles between what i was trying to say in my paintings—and to send that idea more directly to the observer. the above painting, “these five words in my mind” was motivated by a very simple idea that i had been thinking about for a few months—that is, how do words and colors relate? and could you make a painting that had the effect of words—in terms of evoking a response of the observer? and how could you change the colors and shapes to change the meaning and sensation of a painting? let me explain. let’s say you have five words. there are a lot of different things you can say with those five words. change one word, and you can chance the entire meaning of what you are saying. take, for example, the two phrases, “i would hate to love you”, and “i would love to hate you”. these phrase contain the same six words—but you immediately feel different depending on which one is said. in a way, color is the same way. you can make a lot of different paintings with a set of five colors—and if you change one color, the entire sensation will also change. of course, most paintings have dozens or thousands of colors—but do they need all of them? which ones are important to send the meaning? and which ones will change the meaning of the painting—these are the questions i was asking myself when i thinking about the above painting. for this painting, i purposely chose five colors you would probably never see reflected in water—and except the blue—would not likely make anybody think “water”. then i tried to make a painting that said “water” on one hand through the subject matter—but in a very minimal way. in fact, the main purpose was to combine five colors into a certain sensation—that is to send a sensation through a certain color “note” or harmony. also, i used shapes moving from larger to smaller (and hard edge to soft) to give the painting a sense of moving back in space—so that the five colors soon become “color”, “space”, and “sensation” all at the same time-(by combining in your eye)—just like a certain phrase would (or even five music notes) do as they are uttered or played. you cannot hear the individual words or notes—only feel the sensation. i know it probably all sounds pretty crazy—but that is what i was thinking about before i started this painting and while i was painting it—the sensation of five words running around my head. okay, so how does this relate to the subject of this post? well, i have been thinking a lot about how paintings communicate and what that means for how artists might approach their paintings. one of the things i think is important is that an artist at least be clear about the motivation for painting before moving to the easel. i have heard instructors say that you must “have one idea” or that you should “focus on the main idea of the painting” while you paint. i have known that to be true based on my own experience. when i start to paint with one idea in mind (say, capturing the feeling of a sunset) and then start focusing on something else half way through (such as the the color of the mountains)—it is more than likely going to led to a bad painting. the fact is, that a successful paintings are those that deliver a clear message to the observer—as simply as possible. if the artist is not clear—how can he/she expect the observer to see it clearly? so what does this mean for starting a painting? well, obviously, i think the first step is to make sure you know what you want to say before you start a painting. that is, do you want to say something about something you are seeing, feeling, or something that pleases you visually? keep that idea in your mind as you plan and work on the painting. make it as simple as possible. my experience is this simple approach will lead to better outcomes. successful paintings require a lot of pre-meditation. many painters and students focus so much on the mechanics of painting—color mixing and drawing—they forget about the “why”. so next time you are about to start a painting. take a few moments to think about why you have chosen the subject. ask some hard questions about what attracts you to that subject or landscape. really work through your motivation for starting a painting—before you start mixing colors and drawing on the canvas—and stick with this idea throughout. try to get that idea onto the canvas. when you step back from the canvas, ask yourself not if looks like the subject matter—but if it feels like it . not if the drawing is good, but if the sensation is good. does the figure feel like it is standing? not is the gesture correct, but does it feel correct? why is this important—because when the observer sees your work—this is what he/she will feel right away more than any amount of good drawing or careful color mixing. the idea or message of a painting comes to the viewer in one quick moment as a feeling (like five spoken words)—and so you need to be sure that you are communicating and assessing your paintings at that level. okay, i know this is a bit touchy feely for some of you. but i hope you got something out if it. all the best, sixtyminuteartist . "untitled" (study), polymer on paper, 17 1/2 x 23 inches jerry lebo, 2008 the weather is getting better in dc, so i have been able to stroll around during my lunch hour and take a few pictures that i can use as reference material in the studio. i am thankful for my digital camera—not only can i look at the picture right after it is taken—but i can take hundreds of pictures and then simply delete the bad ones. i end up throwing out most of the pictures i take, in any case. in the past, i used to pay to develop a whole roll of film and then throw out the majority of the shots. so i love my digital camera. anyway, the above study is one of the paintings i am thinking of making into one of the large “color space” paintings that i have been talking about in my blog recently. the study is based on a photo i took last week when i was walking near the hirshhorn museum . i like the unusual composition—and thought it would be a good opportunity to explore various color harmonies. i usually do these sorts of painting studies using acrylics and sometimes oils (i gesso the paper for oils). i really struggled with the color relationships in this study and it took me quite a while to figure out how to get the effect i was after. the reference photo and painting are quite different. i have put the reference photo below so you can see the changes i made—basically i re-worked the entire color harmony in pursuit of what i have been talking about recently—that is, how to evoke a certain psychological response in the viewer using color. one of the problems when moving from a small study to a large painting is that a painting that looks good small—may not look good in a larger format. the reverse also holds true, that a large painting may not be very interesting if painted in a smaller format. you have to decide to “go big” or not based on a smaller studies—and it is not always easy to imagine the effect. anyway, i am thinking of trying the above painting in a large (50x66 inches) format—what do you think? send me a comment. okay, so let’s get to the point of this post—which is how to use “color references” in the studio. i have increasingly found that i am nearly blind when it comes to color. i know that sounds strange—but the light in my studio is always changing, my mood changes, and even my sight seems to change when i am in the studio. i look at a color at one moment—and it looks greenish—and then two minutes later it looks to have change to a bluish color. i have written about this in some previous posts—but i think color is the hardest part of being an artist. it is such a moving target—even for a trained artist. one solution i have come to increasingly rely on is the uses of color reference materials. that is, pieces of color that i have lying around my studio—that can serve as a neutral reference point. for example, in just moving from the easel to the palette—sometimes my thoughts about a color change. i might think i have the right color when i am mixing it on the palette—and then get to the canvas and change my mind. so which color is right? the one i was seeing on the palette or the one i have on my brush? it depends, of course, on what color i was after. which i might have forgotten by the time i am ready to make the stroke—since i am daydreaming about something else most of the time anyway! color references don’t need to be expensive or complicated. they can be pieces of paper you paint yourself—or colored paper that you buy. you can use a color matching system—such as pantone—or make up your own system. color charts are also a popular way of color referencing—and can be keyed back to the paints you are using. basically, what you want from a color referencing system is something that you can refer to that is unchanging! examples of color references that i have used in my own studio include pms swatches , color-aid paper , and premixed color charts . the key to using a color reference is to understand what it can—and can’t do. a color reference is not a solution to a problem. it is not a preset color harmony that you can use in a painting (i don’t think this is possible anyway). the benefits of a color reference system in my mind are two. first, it is a tool you can use to work out how colors (and values) will affect each other before you put them onto the canvas. in some ways, this can lead to new color harmonies—but in my experience it can also keep you from mixing the wrong colors or going in circles. second, and in my mind equally important, color references can be used to bridge the gap between the color you are seeing in your mind and the one you are mixing on the palette. for example, when you think “blue”— what blue are you thinking about . if you can pick out the “blue” you want from a color reference system before you start mixing—then you can more quickly know if you mixed the right color. if you are not convinced yet—try this experiment. think about a color you want to use in your paintings. say, a sky color—or the color of the grass on a sunny day. next time you are in the studio—try to mix it. or, better yet, look out the window and mix it based on what you are seeing. once you have mixed the color, put it aside for the moment. next, find a piece of paper or other reference material that is as close as possible to the color you are after. you can again compare it directly (by holding it up to the window, for example). now, mix the color again but with the reference color sitting on your palette. now go back and compare the color you mixed when you did not have the reference—and the one you mixed when you had the reference nearby. which is closer to the color you were after? i think you will see my point pretty quickly. having a neutral reference can get you closer to where you are going--and faster. i am a strong believer in having as much information around you as possible when you are in the studio. photos are an accepted material for artists to use. but this is only one form of information— and not a very good one at that ! i also am a firm believer in color references. there are numerous ways to use these to improve you paintings—color mixing only being one. okay, that’s it for now. go to the studio and paint. all the best, sixtyminuteartist . "dead heroes", polymer on canvas, 47 x 66 inches jerry lebo, 2008 i have been busy over the last few weeks working on several large paintings, which has proven to be a big challenge. the above painting is the first to come off the easel, and is about as big as i can effectively paint in my basement studio. here is a shot of what it looked like on the easel, to give you an idea of the scale. as you can see, i am continuing to pursue the approach i started in the painting of our dog i showed you in my last post. the intent is to push the color harmony ideas i have been talking about over the last few months. that is, to bring together the color interactions in such a way as to make a psychological “color space” which is integral to the subject and message of the painting--and transforms the viewer's experience. the painting itself is based on a photo i took this summer at the world war ii memorial here in dc. i made a photo album for my great uncle who recently died—as he was too ill to travel to see the memorial himself. the picture is of one of the waterfalls that they have at each end of the memorial (one each for the atlantic and pacific campaigns)—this one being the pacific. my great uncle was in the pacific during wwii—and survived the sinking of his ship and his shipmates being eaten by sharks. i have fond memories of how he used to tell me war stories. he is one of the big influences of my youth—always around during the summers i spent in indiana as a kid. he died a couple of months back after a long battle with prostate cancer. i will miss him--and i suppose the painting is a bit of a memorial to his memory. okay, so back to the subject of the post—painting shadows. this post has been lurking in my mind for a couple of weeks--and is motivated by one of the key issues i see people struggling with in their paintings. often we stand back from the easel--and wonder what is wrong with a painting and think "color". but, which color? most of the time we look at the higher value and high chroma hues and start messing around with those--but in fact it may be the shadows that are the problem. frankly, i see this over and over in my students work--they pay a lot of attention to the colors where the light is hitting an object or the landscape--but then mix up some pretty boring, or even plain bad, shadow colors. the first message i want to get across is: shadows are colors! let me say it again another way: the color you are putting in the shadow is just as important as the color you are putting on the highlight. if either one is wrong--the painting will suffer. okay, so how do you find the right shadow color? well, first, you need to be able to see the shadow color. so let me give you a little exercise that i have learned that will help developed your mind and eyes to better see shadow colors. if you do this exercise regularly, it will improve your painting. i promise. it is a little exercise i call, "find the shadow color". the exercise starts by finding a piece of paper that is a single color and at least around four or five inches square in size. it doesn't matter where it comes from--out of a magazine, book cover, or simply paint a piece of paper. next, take the piece of paper and put it a few feet away from you in a location where it is being hit by light. it can be natural light coming in from a window (if you are in the studio)--or light from a lamp. doesn't matter. once you have your color/paper sitting there, take a moment to really notice the color. take a long look--try to remember what it looks like. is it warm or cool? what is the hue? try to memorize the color. next, take the same piece of paper and put it somewhere nearby where it is not being hit by light--but the color is still observable (not in the closet!). for example, if you had the paper sitting on a table, put it on the floor next to the table in the shadow of a table. if it was in the light coming in a window, put it in a place where the light is not directly hitting it. notice the change in color. take a long look--try to remember what the new color looks like--how did it change when you moved it out of the light? did it get warmer or cooler? what is the hue? again, try to memorize the color--and think about how it compares to the color when it was lighted. move it back and forth between light and shadow and notice what happens. okay, now the fun part. go and find another piece of paper (or paint one) that is the color of the paper when it is not being hit by light. this is a lot harder than it sounds. i did this in my office the other day and it took me a good fifteen minutes to find two objects where the color of one was the shadow color of the other. the test that you have the right color is simple. put the two pieces of paper in light together, then move the original piece (the one you first chose and observed in light) into the shadow. if you have the right shadow color, the two pieces of paper should appear to be the same color. below are some pictures to give you a better idea of how this works. the first photo below is of the two pieces of paper that i determined were shadow and highlight colors. they are actually the covers of two publications i had sitting around my office. this is how they look sitting on my desk as lighted by the lighting in my office. so, how do i know that the darker color is the shadow color of the lighter one? simple, i put the lighter color on the floor off the edge of my desk so that i could see them next to the other. in effect, so that the darker one was in the light, but the lighter one was in shadow. below is a photo of the result--taken with the darker one sitting on the desk and the lighter one on the floor in shadow. you can see that they have effectively become the same color. and, yes, the one on the floor is the lighter color in the above photo. hard to believe i know. try this exercise in various lighting conditions and types of light. finding two colors that work may be a bit of a struggle at first, but you will get better at it. if you do it as a regular exercise, you may be surprised how it improves your ability to paint shadow colors (the first thing you will notice is that shadows are colors--and they have predictable relationships!). your mind will remember how colors in shadow and light relate--which will make you quicker at finding the right shadow color. there are a lot of variations on this exercise that can help you out in the studio. for example, say i was painting a still life with an object in it that i was having a hard time finding the right (or even simply believable) shadow color. a simple guide might be to paint a piece of paper the color i was using for the object in light, and another piece the shadow color i was using. then i could do the same as i did above to compare the shadow color to othe other paper "in shadow"--and if the relationship was correct. even if the match was not perfect, i would expect the temperature and general hue would be in the same range. if the two colors are off--you will see it pretty quickly--trust me. one of the things you will notice right away is that the shadow color of something in natural light is much cooler that a shadow of the same object indoors under normal house lighting. which means, for example, that the relationships indoors are different than those you would see if you did the same exercise (with the same colors) outdoors. which means that if you are painting landscapes, use natural lighting for the exercise--and preferably do it outdoors. also, the shadow color of an object will vary with the distance you are away from it. so, if you move one of the pieces of paper closer or farther away from you--the relationships change. so, think of it as a way to train your eyes and guide your thinking--not a scientific experiment. so there you go. a simple exercise to help you explore shadow colors--and to get
Female: 100%, Female,  it's been roughly nine months since i got a sweet f-bomb out of gordon ramsay over the name of my blog, "that would put a f---ing glass eye to sleep!" three girls and i had dinner at mojito in brooklyn, one of ramsay's fixer-uppers on "kitchen nightmares," and tonight's the night it all goes down live on fox. tune in at 9 p.m. et/8c. it scares me to tell you to watch it, without having seen it myself, but it's sure to give you a good laugh. let me know what you think, and if you've just recently discovered my blog, click here for the colorful write-up of that eventful evening. unless you read her book, of course. i finished reading "my life in france" two days ago and the movie " julie &amp; julia " just ended on my dvr. i wanted to know julia child through her own words first so i could test the movie against them (or the words she wrote with her beloved husband paul child's grand-nephew alex prud'homme). "my life in france" was a delightful read. it made me nostalgic for my three adolescent years growing up in paris while it also inspired me to take cooking classes. i don't know if i'm cut out for le cordon bleu , but an introductory course somewhere might do. if you're at all interested in food or cooking i highly advise reading it from cover to cover. i can't wait to buy "mastering the art of french cooking" (volumes i and ii) and "from julia child's kitchen" (a book julia calls her "favorite"). i'm still uninterested, however, in reading the blog-turned-book "julie &amp; julia" written by julie powell. i liked powell's husband in the movie way more than i liked powell (and i adore amy adams). i decided to share a few items that i found fascinating from julia's tale. here is a taste: 10. julia attended smith college. she majored in history and graduated in 1934. her plan after college was to become a famous woman novelist. she sought employment at time, newsweek and the new yorker and when she didn't get a job at either magazine, she worked in the advertising department at the w. &amp; j. sloane furniture store. she made $25 a week. 9. julia met paul while working for the office of strategic services (oss) and "looking for adventure." the oss was an intelligence agency formed during world war ii. the two met in ceylon (what is now sri lanka) in 1944; both were transferred with the oss to kunming, china; and in september of 1946 they were married. paul had a black belt in judo and was a "physical person." he was a photographer and "his pleasure was in the act of creating." paul took many of the photographs julia used to inspire the artwork in her "mastering" cookbook. julia and paul never got around to sending christmas cards so instead they sent their family and friends homemade valentine's day cards. the more ridiculous the better. they seemed to be an adorable couple and i hope for that kind of married happiness someday. 8. one of julia and paul's first meals in france was at restaurant la couronne in rouen, the city where st. joan of arc was burned at the stake. julia described it as "the most exciting meal" of her life. she feasted on sole meuniere and oysters. the restaurant is considered to be the oldest inn in france established just a few years ago in 1345. 7. julia was big on nicknames. her sister dorothy -- five years her junior -- was nicknamed "dort the wort" while julia was called "julia pulia" and at some times even "juke the puke." julia became a very good friend of the legendary james beard (he asked julia to call him jim) and whenever they cooked together they were known as gigi, as in jim and julie with the letter "j" pronounced the french way. 6. julia attended her first cooking class at le cordon bleu with 11 gis who were "studying cooking under the auspices of the gi bill of rights." she was the star student, although she began unable to properly scramble an egg. 5. julia sought a diploma from le cordon bleu so she could teach but she failed the first exam. it was made of two parts: a written and practical exam. she aced the written but didn't know how to cook a single item on the practical exam. it included the following: an oeuf mollet , a veau "en surpise ," and caramel custard. her teacher chef bugnard insisted that despite this debacle, child was qualified to be a chef. she aced the second exam and became a graduate of le cordon bleu. 4. on november 6, 1959, after more than seven years of collaboration, julia's manuscript for a cookbook, co-written with two of her french friends simone "simca" beck (later madame jean fischbacher) and louisette bertholle, was rejected by the editor-in-chief at houghton mifflin for being "a big, expensive cookbook of elaborate information" that "might well prove formidable to the american housewife. she might easily clip one of these recipes out of a magazine but be frightened by the book as a whole." 3. the woman who would later be julia's editor, judith jones, left new york for paris in 1948 at the age of 24 for a three-week vacation, got her purse stolen and never left (her return ticket was in her purse). she was working for doubleday in new york at the time and ended up getting a job as an editorial assistant to a doubleday editor in paris. she just so happened to pick up a book her boss was planning to reject, urged him to give it a second go and when he did, doubleday bought it and it became a worldwide sensation. you may have heard of it: "ann frank: the diary of a young girl." a similar situation happened with julia's manuscript. jones tested several of the recipes, realized what an incredible feat it was and insisted to her bosses it be published. in may 1960 jones sent julia the good news. "we have come to the conclusion it is a unique book that we would be very proud to have on the knopf list." 2. the original title of "mastering" was "french recipes for american cooks" and jones said no way. early contenders were "the master french cookbook" and "the french cooking master." until finally "mastering the art of french cooking." et voila! bon appetit! 1. julia and paul called their homes by names. they lived at 81 rue de l'universite in paris and they called it "rue de loo." they called their property in provence la pitchoune or "little thing." julia held onto la peetch for nearly 30 years -- from 1965 until june 1992. paul was 90 and living in a nursing home outside boston at the time when she decided to move on from their "spiritual home." when asked if she was going to miss it, julia replied, "i've always felt that when i'm done with something i just walk away from it -- fin !" she added, "the heart had gone out of it for me now." sad, in a way, but i know exactly what she meant. aphrodisiac: a food, drink or drug that stimulates sexual desire; a thing that causes excitement. we've all heard of the term, and at one point or another, i'm sure we've all consumed one or several of them. has it made you hornier or more of a sex machine? the jury's out, but for a different take on the valentine's day list of restaurants, here's my top 10 sexual helpers paired up with the places you can find them in new york city. have fun and best of luck with finding love and some heat this weekend. 10. asparagus asparagus “stirs up lust in man and woman," wrote a 17th century herbalist. asparagus is a great source of potassium, fiber, vitamin b6, vitamins a and c, and thiamin and folic acid. folic acid is known for boosting histamine production necessary for the ability to reach orgasm in both sexes. you'll find the best asparagus dish in the city at riposo 72 . the sleeper wine bar on the upper west side grills its asparagus and wraps them in prosciutto and a thin layer of melted parmesan. it's to die for. 9. avocado like the asparagus, the avocado is rich in folic acid. and just look at it. its shape alone is sexual. so much so that catholic priests in spain once forbade it. the best way to eat avocado is sliced on a sandwich, in sushi or chopped up in guacamole. for the first, head to cafe ronda for their chipotle sandwich with chicken, onions and avocados. for sushi head to bondst for their salmon avocado roll. you'll find the best guacamole in the city at mama mexico on the upper west side or at any rosa mexicano location. the freshly-made guac is the stuff and both of these mexican-themed restaurants chop the avocado right in front of you. 8. bananas in addition to potassium, bananas contain chelating minerals and the bromeliad enzyme, that are believed to enhance the male libido. look at your significant other, start pealing one and eat it in front of him or her with a straight face. have fun with that. the only bananas i've eaten in this city, excluding the ones for 60 cents at my office cafeteria, have been on pancakes. head to norma's for a sick short stack. their banana-macadamia nut flap jacks with whipped banana and brown sugar butter are off the charts. 7. foie gras i've never been a huge fan of foie gras (or how they treat the ducks in the process), but if you're a francophile in search of some loving, hit up bar boulud . they have an excellent selection of foie gras and pates. try their country pate foie gras with truffle juice and port. whether it's the ingredients or the fine food's mystique that grabs you, if eating it makes you feel sexy, go for it. 6. basil smelling basil alone puts me under. head to kuma inn for their steamed edamame with thai basil-lime oil. if you prefer going the italian route, head to gradisca for a couple of options. not only is this one of my favorite italian spots in the city, but it's romantic as well and you can try their caprese salad with basil or the cavatelli pasta with tomato, eggplant and basil. 5. pine nuts pine nuts are high in zinc -- a mineral necessary to maintain male potency. kefi has an incredible dish with pine nuts: the sheep's milk dumplings with tomatoes, pine nuts and warm, soft feta. if i could i would eat at kefi once a week. an alternative to the dumplings would be frederick's caprese salad with pine nuts sprinkled on top. 4. chocolate chocolate contains chemicals thought to effect neurotransmitters in the brain. the aztecs once called chocolate the "nourishment of the gods." sfoglia serves an incredible pasta dish with chocolate: its gnocchi with mushroom and chocolate shavings. if you'd rather have chocolate in a sexy dessert, head to artisanal for their romantic chocolate fondue. 3. garlic the "heat" in garlic is said to stir sexual desires. i eat garlic in just about anything, but one of my favorite dishes in the city is at esperanto . they serve mussels on the half shell, roasted with garlic, topped with parmesan and paprika. pair the mussels with one of esperanto's exceptional brazilian cocktails and you're sure to score big this weekend. good also flaunts its mussels with tons of garlic in addition to white wine, herbs and grilled country bread. 2. wine we all know red wine can be awfully seductive and this city has its fair share of places to find it. though wine bars have a rather effeminate sound to them, don't fear, gents, bring your gal to one of these low-key spots and you'll be a hit. riposo 72 makes it on the aphrodisiac list twice. you don't even have to taste the wine here to feel sexy -- you'll feel hot just holding their huge wine glasses. their cozy warm atmosphere is heavy on the romance as well. taste is another favorite of mine for vino. for more generous pours head to i trulli , peasant , bar boulud , grape and grain , and clo wine bar at columbus circle. if you want to stay in with your honey, head to morrell's in rockefeller center or 67 wine for my two favorite wine stores in the city. 1. oysters the romans were the first to label oysters as an aphrodisiac. there are many places to find oysters in new york city. the best in my book is aquagrill in the west village. some runners-up would be grand central oyster bar , jack's luxury oyster bar and morimoto . if you're in the mood for surf and turf, grab some oysters at my new favorite steakhouse keen's . "are you alive?????? when can we get dinner?!?!??" asked funstar. she's always so dramatic. she produces a cable news show and they type the rundown in all caps and i think she forgets to turn off her work type from time to time. i still love her. funstar sent me a few of these e-mails starting back in november and it took us until the first week in january to get together. she always has a wish list of places to try -- a few years back she had an excel spreadsheet -- so i asked her to e-mail me the ones at the top of this list. excel or no excel, when i saw momofuku ssam bar on the list, i got fired up. johnny depp is to the academy award as i formerly was to david chang's restaurants. (if you don't know chang, please read this article before you proceed. you will not regret it. i wish larissa macfarquhar did profiles on all of new york city chefs. i've had a crush on the guy ever since.) momofuku restaurants have been eluding me for years. much like babbo once was to me, the restaurants in the momofuku family had an unattainable quality to them. i would hear someone asking if i'd tried momofuku ko, if i liked momofuku noodle bar, if i wanted to go to ssam bar and i'd throw my head back, roll my eyes and give them a loud "pfffhhaa! good luck." i am the first to admit that if a restaurant is notoriously hard to get into i will avoid it at all costs, or wait around until it's uncool to try it. sadly, neither momofuku ssam bar nor any of its sister restaurants are getting any uncooler so funstar gave me the kick in the pants i needed to swallow my ferocious pride and give it a whirl. there was one slight problem. over the past four months i've been eating strictly vegetarian. i feared eating at one of chang's spots would be a total disaster. i even asked my twitter followers and @eaterny if there was a point in me trying momofuku ssam bar. the responses were mixed. one person wrote: don't go to momo if you're a vegetarian there are better choices. another wrote: pork buns and spicy rice cakes...and compost cookies. drool. while a third wrote: there are fish options and a veg or 3. i consulted the menu and it looked doable. we would dine at momofuku ssam bar despite funstar being concerned about her having to eat all the meat dishes by herself. i told her she'd live. i showed up at 8:25-ish. the place was a zoo, yet the hostess came and found me like a magnet. when i told her i was waiting for my friend running late from work, she pointed me in the direction of the milk bar and said she'd come in to check on me to see if my second party had arrived. i couldn't get over how friendly she was. i was surprised by the simplicity of the decor in ssam bar. the tables were like picnic benches with an asian flare. the chairs were backless. folks at tables were to the right side (and there weren't a lot of them) and to the other side was the bar. it seemed like some of the tables were communal. both the bar and table areas took up an equal amount of space in the dining room. the decor wasn't the hype here, or the coziness. the food was. backless chairs don't lend well to settling in and hanging around for hours. the horizontal wood paneling and table design reminded me of that of the chelsea pizzeria co. i wasn't entirely sure what the hostess meant by the milk bar. i knew it was attached but visually i couldn't see what she meant. i just kept following the narrow space between the bar and the tables, saw the bright light of the open kitchen at the far end of the dining room and found another hallway. at the end of this hallway there were large groups of people standing in line for bakery items, ranging from cookies and cakes to ice cream and soft serve. i guess it doubled as the waiting room. i plopped my pur-ggage on the table with a thud and made it clear i'd be staying for a while. i whipped out julia child's "my life in france" and began to alternate between reading a few paragraphs and checking out the commotion around me. i heard about four different accents in the span of 20 minutes: bostonian, australian, german and french. this place was no secret to foreigners. everyone knew and idolized chang. the four young 20-something dudes behind me were drooling over what pork plate they were going to get, how chang's fried chicken was "bad ass," and how they wanted a compost cookie for later. what the hell was a compost cookie? i looked up and saw it had pretzels, potato chips, butterscotch, coffee, oats and chocolate and any other crumbs lying around the kitchen chang and his chefs could find. this was right up my alley. a petite blond college student in front of me was going on and on to her two friends about balancing studying with her long-distance boyfriend and how she was really more into hooking up locally with randoms than having a committed relationship with someone who was far away. her boring "far away" man was in boston. i was tempted to blurt out her ridiculous whining on overheardinnewyork.com , but i decided to continue reading instead. where was funstar? the hostess came to check on me at least one more time before funstar arrived. i couldn't believe how incredible the service was. she could have just dumped me in the back and waited for me to come find her when funstar got there but no. she kept her word and made sure i was still solo. when funstar did come she went and found our hostess. i almost told her not to worry she was looking out for us but i was getting pretty hungry at this point after all the compost talk so if funstar could expedite the seat process i'd be thrilled. "mona!" she waved at me at the end of the hallway connecting the milk bar to ssam. "really? ready? coming!" i shoved my book and gloves and hat and scarf in my pur-ggage and flew off to start our ssam adventure. we snagged a great front seat at the bar. this was perfect. we could look at the menu, ask questions and watch the bartenders at work -- one of my favorite things to do. "so...i need an update. like now!" "ok, ok... christmas was incredible. we had the best time," i replied. "can i get you guys a drink?" asked a tall thin guy with a chunk of his blond hair spiked in the front and pointing off to the right like an arrow. he was wearing an interesting two-toned green t-shirt and when he stepped away it reminded me of the old hyper-color tees. "oh shoot. we haven't gotten that far yet," i responded. "ok, let's choose our drinks and then you'll tell me what happened," said funstar. funstar told me about a drink she'd had recently called a french 75. her version was made of champagne, gin (though some recipes call for cognac or brandy) and lemon juice. we asked the bartender if he could make one. there were cocktails with champagne on the menu, but he had an idea they weren't supposed to use champagne for cocktails they didn't have on the menu. it sounded strange to us, but he was very smiley and friendly so we didn't think twice about it. i asked him about the seasonal pickle brine martini with plymouth gin. to this dirty martini nut it sounded delish. i chose the classic with gin and funstar went with a vodka version. "ok. spill it!" "so... we met at our friend's wedding --" "dude. i know that part. fast forward to more recent," she ordered. "ha! ok, ok. i don't remember what you know and what you don't know. we've seen each other four times now. he came to new york once and i went to los angeles twice--" "so you met him and you've seen him three times since and you're totally gonzo!?" "i know, i know. it must sound totally insane. but i'm totally insane about him. if you asked me to describe my dream man physically and emotionally it would be him. i just feel so lucky!" "i'm so happy for you!" "christmas was a total whirlwind. we went whale-watching with his parents. our parents met at dinner. everyone got along super well. i spent a week with the fam and then i flew down to l.a. to be with him for four days. it was so awesome." "wow," she responded. "do you guys have any questions about the menu?" "oh... we haven't even looked. sorry..." "let's pick out food and we'll keep talking after," suggested funstar. "done and done." we looked at the menu and there were a bunch of items that jumped out at us. we tried as much as we could between two girls, one being a vegetarian. as our first cocktails dried up, the bartender informed us he'd inquired about making the french 75 and that he could in fact use the champagne for items not on the drinks menu. it was very sweet of him to pursue this further, because we had certainly forgotten, so we ordered up a round of french 75s and kept ogling at the menu. we copied our neighbors and tried the cured hamachi with edamame, horseradish and pea leaves. the horseradish was charred black and i could have eaten the crumbles by the pint. the hamachi was light and fresh with an edamame sauce. the horseradish saved this dish from being bland. next we tried the cracked jonah crab claws with harissa mayo. like i mentioned below at choptank , crab claws don't really do it for me. i tried to suck all the meat and juice out of the smallest claw and it was a lot of work for not a lot of substance. next time i eat a crab it'll be a full sucker. funstar wasn't impressed either. funstar tried the steamed pork buns with hoisin, cucumbers and scallions. ever since eating at kuma inn i've loved the white gooey, almost marshmallow-like bun with pork belly. i kept to my vegetarian ways and just tried a sliver of the foamy bread and wished i could have had a plain side of the bun. i bet if i'd asked i could have. rats. we finished up with the bread and butter plate with two types of butter: sea salt from vermont and whipped lardo. the bread was disappointing. it was thick and heavy on the tough crust with too little soft on the inside. maybe chang should outsource the one thing he's not an expert in -- french bread (sorry fci). s'il est deja en train de faire ceci, je suis tres desole. the butter, however, was ridiculous, especially the lardo. it was so rich it could have been cheese. i almost wanted to eat it plain with a spoon. i knew it would give me a heart attack so i refrained, but man. who knew butter could be so flavorful? chang. that's who. last and definitely not least, we tried the fried brussels sprouts with mint and a fish sauce vinaigrette. with all the hype surrounding momofuku we hadn't been all that moved by the food... until the brussels sprouts. i don't care if you've never liked or tried a brussels sprout in your life, this is one of new york's finest dishes. no joke. i couldn't figure out if i wanted to just inhale them or eat them slowly so they'd last longer. a couple sitting next to us asked what they should get and besides the pork belly and the hamachi i yelled with brussels sprouts hanging out of my mouth, "thuh bruhthull thprouths!" "so? tell me more about maineman!!?" throughout dinner it was a battle to consume what was in front of us and each other's lives over the past six months. "so... what is it about him, mona?" i think i have a face now whenever someone mentions him. it's called maineman face and i get called out on it constantly. i light up like the tree and ice skating rink at rockefeller center. "i always told my mom i needed to find myself a mountain man, a manly man, someone who was tough as nails on the outside, but a soft, sensitive guy on the inside. maineman is that guy." "i love it!" "i don't know. i'll always be an athlete at heart. and i've always needed someone equally as tough as me, both emotionally and physically, and i always found it hard to be attracted to someone who wasn't. this probably sounds ridiculous..." "no! go on." "i couldn't date a wuss or a whiner. i've never met someone tougher, more active and more ready for an adventure than he is. i asked him if he wanted to do a marathon and he said, 'yeah, sure!' without a second thought. are you kidding me!?" "i know exactly what you mean. we're both tough cookies. i needed that too," she added. it was a huge relief that what i was saying wasn't gibberish. "right?! yet, at the same time, he's a complete love... a total softie. so anyway...he's amazing and there isn't a second of any day where i don't doubt or question what he's thinking or feeling. because he tells me all the time. it's never a mystery. and he lives across the country! i dated someone who i practically lived with who never said the sweet things maineman says to me. i really can't..." "mona!" "... believe how lucky i am to have found..." "mona!" "...him. i just feel so..." "mona!" "oh god, sorry. what?" "you're totally glowing. it's so great. glow-ing! i'm sooooo soooo happy for you." "aww, thanks funstar! it's just crazy. and i totally get it now." we wrapped up dinner, thanked our bartender profusely for taking such good care of us and headed to the milk bar for some dessert. funstar had tried the cookies before and kept saying "blueberry blueberry blueberry" in my ear. i barely like fruit as it is so the thought of eating blueberries in a cookie just sounded borderline revolting. maineman teases me for being the only vegetarian he knows who doesn't like vegetables and fruit. after staring at the blackboard for a good solid five minutes and not really registering what was happening i gave in. we went with the blueberry and cream cookie and the compost cookie. these are the only two cookies you're allowed to try if you go to chang's milk bar. they were soft, gooey, chewy and i wanted to wrap myself in them. just how a cookie ought to be. "we’re not the best cooks," chang once told the new yorker back in march 2008. "we’re not the best restaurant -- if you were a really good cook you wouldn’t be working here, because really good cooks are a--holes. but we’re gonna try our best, and that’s as a team." chang is no bulls--- artist. and his food is no bulls--- either. i don't know if i'll ever be ready to fight the minions to get into momofuku ko, but i am psyched to know i can count on a bar stool at ssam for brussels sprouts, lardo, a strong cocktail, great service and a warm compost cookie for dessert. drool indeed. 207 2 avenue, at 13th st. 212) 254-3500 worked on this opus for 12 long hours yesterday. i found some great new friends on the web, while reaching out to some old friends as well. i hope you enjoy these recipes! i'm seriously rethinking my decision to become a vegetarian after compiling this (but i won't, winette, don't fret). i'm off to sunny orlando with @jcole this weekend. disneyworld wedding, here we come. until next week, friends. and you can click here for last year's rendition for another 10 gluttonous dishes. "hey! we're going to grab dinner tonight at choptank. would you guys like to join? it looks v. yummy, classic b'more food," wrote fashionista. "only if you promise the hush puppies will be authentic. i'm in," said byowino. fashionista made reservations for five of us at choptank, the new chesapeake bay-themed restaurant in the west village. she's a sucker for anything that says maryland or crabs so i knew it wouldn't be long until we ended up there, whether it was for ftdc or another occasion. my friend sunkist was visiting from colorado and i asked fashionista if we could crash her and jerseyboy's date night at choptank. every friday they are in town they pick a restaurant off eater's 38 (their list of essential new york dining spots). for this place they were making an exception. i wanted fashionista to meet sunkist and after a full day of back-to-back dance classes, i knew sunkist would be up for a good, hearty meal. sunkist and i went to school together in charlottesville and we moved to snowmass, colo., after 9/11. sunkist went from being the star of aspen's crystal palace to producing her own children's plays in aspen. she is opening up a dance studio as well and part of her goal in coming to new york was to brushen up on some of the hottest trends in dance. i could devote an entire post to our hip hop class at the ailey dance studio , but i'll save that humiliation and embarrassment for only my closest friends (and the unlucky passersby who got to watch my sorry butt wiggle and wag in the ailey fishbowl studio). unfortunately, sunkist had a class that night that went until nine. reservations were at 8:30. "we can shower at the studio so we can be quick to meet up," she texted. i don't think sunkist understood the whole new york reservation situation. i told her we'd play it by ear, knowing that we'd probably end up eating and meeting her somewhere after. little annie's in aspen may let you hang out and casually wait for friends to arrive, but new york tables didn't quite work that way. i'd already asked fashionista to change her reservation once and i didn't feel like making her do it again. i e-mailed a few friends who i thought would be interested in dinner and we had one taker: byowino. sunkist would join us later after her class and either sit with us or at the bar, depending on the space. i was the first one to show up at choptank. since i'd been the annoying friend adjusting and readjusting our reservation, i was not going to be the annoying late friend. i walked in and felt sort of lost in the overly large empty space at the front for standing, checking in and waiting. there were two high tables with stools on either side of the door by the windows. one couple sat with their blackberries lit on the table. he would answer, she would stare off into space, he would hang up; she would answer, he would stare off into space, she would hang up. this little dance continued for about 10 minutes. they seemed to be meeting more people like i was, yet they had drinks and i did not. hmmph. after checking in i sat down opposite them and watched the place in action. the entrance space was straight up awkward. the bar behind the check-in table was a good four or five stairs up from ground level. they should have expanded the bar further towards the window and increased their stool surface area, while decreasing the over-sized pointless space in front. as soon as fashionista, jerseyboy and byowino arrived, we exchanged hugs, left our tired winter coats with a host and headed off to our table. the main dining area scored high on the cool meter. choptank was dominated by its two huge square-shaped bars in the middle of the room. the space with tables (and those who weren't cool enough to make the cut at bar seats) seemed like a lame after-thought. if you go to choptank, eat at the bar. i immediately wished i was meeting one person instead of three so i could sit in front of the bartenders, drink out of a big wine glass and stare at the oysters all night. the place was completely packed, yet somehow we scored the best table in the place - the end table right by the window. the dining area loops around to the left. after you pass the two bars you head down a few stairs again for the five or six tables on ground level. we were big fans of the corkboard on each wall. "i think we need to come in next time with a photo of all of us and just stick it up there," said fashionista. "hells yes! right in the middle of all the beach and sand scenes," said byowino. "i love this plan," i added. i hope the wall has since filled up since we visited. it was looking a little sparse. our waitress came to the table for our drink order. fashionista and i ordered a couple of cocktails while the boys ordered beers. our waitress was friendly and mildly attentive, but as sharp as a used piece of chewing gum. "what happened to the hush puppies? that was one of the reasons i came," said byowino, half-jokingly, half-serious. "well...they had those in the beginning for our soft opening, then the chef must have taken them off the menu." "why?" "i have no idea." "does the crab chowder have corn in it?" fashionista asked. "i have no idea." "do you mind...err... finding out?" "oh, you want me to find out? ok, sure." the cocktails were pretty intense. mine was the size of a pint-glass and half-filled with ice. potent. fashionista's came out and i wanted to ask, "that's it?" it looked awfully silly next to my gargantuan drink. she tasted hers and was unhappy. it was a bit too heavy on the gin and you could barely taste the st. germain, not to mention it was warm and would have tasted a million times better chilled. i liked mine, mostly for the ginger and huge ice cubes, and would definitely order it again. for starters we tried the crab claws. we tried ordering the crab dip and chips off the menu, but the waitress informed us each table got a complimentary order. this was a nice gesture, but perhaps best to take that off th
Male: 100%, Male, this morning, artist/sculptor mike kraus sent me images of the clay mold he has recently completed of the sword that will soon be replaced on the general james nagle statue. simply stated, i am blown away by the level of detail. indeed, this is an exact rendering of the sword nagle was presented following his return from the mexican-american war and of the bronze sword that was originally placed on the monument in 1904. i think you will agree with me that this is superb, stellar work. i certainly could not be happier. the next step is the bronzing!
Female: 100%, Female, hey kids.. sorry, but you probably won't be seeing a post on my daring baker challenge this weekend. unfortunately what i thought was a simple cold has gotten worse and it's about kicked my arse. combine that with work and my procrastination issues and well.. no tiramisu in my kitchen this month. :( i did buy all the ingredients, so i'm ready to go in that respect.. just need my nose to dry the freeg up and then figure out a way to assassinate the lil fuckers in my head who are pounding the backs of my eyeballs with sledgehammers. gah. so we'll see.. in the meantime, check out the daring bakers blogroll for 1000's of creative and beautiful tiramisu participants.. everyone did (as usual!!) an amazing job with the challenge! huge hugs to both deeba and aparna for being wonderful hostesses this month.. they picked an awesome challenge of making homemade mascarpone and lady finger cookies! from what i've read in our private forums, both of the recipes are delicious! i really want to find out for myself! xoxo i had heard of the croque-monsieur sandwich often in the past year or so.. apparently it's making the rounds in the foodie-blog world, since that's where i discover many foods i'd never heard of before. it sounded intriguing, something i might want to try one day, but nothing to add to the must make list. i mean seriously, it's a grilled ham &amp; cheese sammie. no big whoop. and then i was going through some magazine last week - for the life of me i can't remember what it was called - and saw this photo of the most awesome looking sandwich i'd ever seen. it had a fried egg on top! i don't think i've ever spoke of my obsession? fascination? complete and utter glee when it comes to the fried egg, specifically the yolk. but there's a twist. yes, i love fried eggs for breakfast (or dinner) with the usual accoutrements - buttered toast, sausage or bacon, hashbrowns, you know.. heart attack on a plate? :) but this obsession - fascination - complete and utter glee that i feel when i see something topped with a friend egg, that normally wouldn't be topped with an egg.. i just.. can't find the words without sounding gross. salivate upon seeing oozing yolk is what it is, but frankly, i just grossed myself out by saying that. salivate and oozing really shouldn't be in the same sentence. hopefully you yolk lovers out there will get where i'm coming from.. if not.. maybe try to block out what you've just read by closing your eyes tightly and singing la la la la la i can't hear you miss gross-y mcgrosster extremely loudly until the images go away. :p it was the mental vision of a crispy baked sammie loaded with cheese and that broken yolk oozing (i can't stop with the fakkin oozing! someone give me a better word for crissakes - and don't say "runny" cuz that squicks me out too!) down the side of it that had me in such a tizz.. hell it could have been a rabbit turd &amp; peat moss sandwich and i would have been drooling all because of that egg. i once saw a salad made of greens, roasted sweet potato chunks and a big old fried egg on top and although i haven't made it yet, i still drool over the thought of it. a salad with roasted chunks of sweet potato for crissakes? all because of that ooz glorious fried egg. anyhoo... as i read the intro to the recipe and realized it was a croque-monsieur with a fried egg thrown on top, the sandwich jettisoned to the must make list tout de suite. so i ripped the pages out, brought it home to show hubbs and he agreed, we needed to have this for dinner asap. basically, if ya'll haven't heard of the croque-monsieur, it's ham &amp; cheese (usually gruyère or emmental) between two slices of bread that have been slathered with a bechamel sauce, and then more cheese on top. it's baked until the edges are lightly browned and the cheese is melty and bubbly. once it comes out of the oven, you slap a fried egg on top to create the croque- madame , throw a nice salad next to it and call it heaven on a plate. i made a few changes to the recipe. i couldn't find the jambon de paris ham it called for, so i used prosciutto. i'm not a big bechamel sauce by itself kinda gal, so i decided to doctor it up by tossing in a couple generous handfuls of gruyère (i still had quite a bit left over from the bread ) and just the barest peench of ground mustard. i used a loaf of french miche, which i bought at panera - miche, i assume, means fakking huge. it's a very large square loaf of french bread just perfect for grilling, baking, toasting and of course, making a croque-madame. :) hubbs made a cucumber, tomato, olive &amp; red onion salad in balsamic vinaigrette to go with and i think that's really a must. at least for us.. this sammie is rich, kids. it definitely needs a salad or other light side with it. i had considered frying potatoes &amp; onions, making our dinner more breakfast-like, but am glad that i didn't. so who doesn't like a ham & cheese sammie, eh? i like them, they are o.k., not my favorite but i've eaten many in my day. who hasn't? feel about the same way? kinda meh? yeah well.. make this kicked up hot ham & cheese sandwich and i doubt you'll ever go back to the usual. we were both amazed at how good this was. admittedly, the prosciutto wasn't the right ham. it was too salty, but that still didn't take away much from the sandwich in whole. and it was fun to eat a "gourmet" hot ham & cheese with a fork & knife! i suppose you could pick it up and eat it as you would any other sammie, but it'd be kinda messy.. but hey, if that's your thing, go for it. ;) i urge you all to go out and buy a good ham that's not too salty, a big chunk of gruyère or emmental (i'm sure swiss would be just fine) and a dozen eggs and get to making this for your dinner this week - and then throw it into your rotation every once in a while. it's a bit of a splurge both in price and calories, but you won't be sorry after you take that first bite. trust me. so. fakkin. good. croque monsieur or madame serves 4 for bechamel sauce: 3 tbs. butter 1/4 c. all-purpose flour 3 c. whole milk (i used fat-free and it came out just fine) pinch of freshly grated nutmeg salt & white ground pepper to taste for the sandwiches: 8 slices high-quality bread. (the recipe called for "pullman" loaf, i used french) sliced 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick. 12 oz. thinly sliced jambon de paris (high quality wet-cured ham, not too salty) 10 oz. gruyère cheese, coarsely grated 4 whole eggs (for the madame) over low heat, in a small saucepan, melt butter then whisk in flour until blended. continue to whisk while pouring in milk to avoid lumps. continue to cook, stirring constantly until thickened. this should take about 10 minutes. (if you are only making enough for 2 the sauce thickened within 2 minutes) once thickened, season with nutmeg, salt & pepper. (this is where i added a couple handfuls of grated gruyère and the smallest pinch of ground mustard) take off heat, set aside. the recipe says you can make the bechamel sauce up to 24 hours early. place plastic wrap directly on the sauce so it won't form a skin, then refrigerate. gently reheat a few minutes before you are going to use it. preheat the oven to 400º f. place the 8 slices of bread in a single layer on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. spread the bechamel sauce evenly to the edges of all the slices (you may not need all of the bechamel). divide ham between only 4 slices covered with bechamel, keeping the ham within 1/4 inch of the edges. top all 8 slices with equal amounts of grated gruyère cheese, again spreading it evenly within 1/4 inch of the edges. place the 4 slices with bechamel and cheese (cheese side up!) on top of the slices layered with ham. bake until cheese topping is melted and golden brown about 10 to 15 minutes (it took about 20 minutes in my oven) to make the croque-madame, fry 4 eggs sunny-side up (i went with over easy, because egg slime is a very bad thing) and place one on top of each sandwich. sprinkle with salt & pepper and serve immediately. xoxo kids! i don't know what the hell has possessed me, but i've baked. and not for a daring baker's challenge, either. i baked on my own. wtf? here's what i'm thinking.. ya'll should run out and buy lots of bottled water, saltine crackers, canned goods and toilet paper (never be without toilet paper!!). dig yourself an underground shelter in the back yard and prepare yourself for some kind of natural disaster. i don’t bake unless it’s a db challenge! something bad is surely going to happen! and bread! lord almighty i never bake bread on a whim or on my own - never. this disaster is going to be a doozy – i’m tellin’ yas! wait.. don’t go getting all panic stricken just yet. i still have my usually long ass story to tell. come back. sit down. join me in a glass (or twelve) of your favorite alcoholic beverage.. believe me, it’ll calm those shaking hands. or is it just my hands that are shaking? whatev. anyhoo, something made me finally bake this recipe again. go look. because if you don't go look you won't understand what a wonderment this baking adventure was. seriously. go. look. did i lie? is that not the most frightening things you've ever seen? it's like science fiction and pornography combined. and i ate those bad boys. all 4 of them. in like a week. if even. it was the best damn cheesy bread i've ever had and at that juncture in my life i didn't think anything could be as good as panera's asiago bread . but those 4 cheesy baked monstrosities were phenomenal. i kept saying that i would make them again.. but baking is sooooooooo fakking stressful for me. the baking gods hate my ever-livin guts. they laugh at me at every occasion. they mock me at the drop of a hat. they sneer and point at me while whispering behind my back. i don't know what the fakk i ever did to piss them off, but i obviously did. and now, what? 2 years later? something possesses me to make them again. i made the starter last thursday night. i was unsure how far ahead you can make a starter, so i enlisted the advice of my bread baking guru , mary. she told me i can make it a few days ahead, which eased some pressure as i knew i wanted to make it this weekend, but was unsure of the exact day. har! yeah.. in other words - how long could i procrastinate before my started died and i chickened out? gah. well.. come to find out the baking gods were watching - as per fucking usual. you see, the recipe calls for instant yeast. i didn't even comprehend that.. i used active yeast. so after 15+ hours (i had to work on friday), it hadn't gotten very bubbly and pretty much looked just like a wad of dough. not good. so i got on the king arthur website and with an expert. it was immediately pointed out that i used the wrong yeast. duh. i thanked her and then realized… baking gods – 1 / lisa – bigfatfuckingzero. i didn't have instant yeast, so i sweet talked my beloved hubbs into running out to get me some. bless his cotton socks. soon i had the correct yeast and more bread flour. i started again - this time around 6 a.m. saturday morning. i figured it’d be good to go around 2ish that afternoon, then i’d make the dough and allow it to rise until sunday morning. way longer than what’s called for, but i’ve read that if you let your dough rise for a long time, the better the flavor of the bread.. and hell, any excuse to actually put off baking it. yeah, the memory of the smoke detector going off and black billowy smoke spewing from my oven the last time i made this bread was pretty damn strong. well my powers of procrastination are pretty damn.. uhmm.. powerful. i managed to conveniently “forget” the starter on saturday afternoon. and saturday night. on sunday morning i remembered it and said to myself, “hey dipshit, you need to make the bread today.” and then i blocked it out again. i had plans with my girlie friends to go shopping at trader joe’s.. and i’ve been out of tejava tea for a month. nectar of the (non-baking) gods, i tell ya! so my mind was conveniently “elsewhere”. :p when i got home sunday afternoon, i put away the groceries, poured myself a big glass of tea and got the flour out. i was going to make the dough! go me! making the dough took roughly 5 minutes. mmmm hmm… 5 whole fakking minutes of my time. a spare 5 minutes that i just couldn’t seem to find all day saturday and most of sunday. you see this is how my mind works. and believe me, i know i ain’t right. knowing full well how delicious the bread would end up, i still did everything i could to drag my big fat feet in making it. it’s like i’m a glutton for my own punishment. what. the. freeg? before i went to bed sunday night, i punched the dough down because obviously i wasn’t going to make the bread. today was a rare morning.. i actually woke up after my husband. that happens maybe twice a year? and i’m usually sick.. but whatev, i woke up later and the first thing out of his mouth wasn’t the usual grumble-speak “mrn’ng” or even “is the princess finally up?” it was, “my goodness, doesn’t that freshly baked bread smell delicious?” what an ass. this was his way of telling me that the dough had been sitting out far too long and if i was going to bake bread then i better shit or get off the pot. visual there.. sorry. moving along.. a lovely collage of basically the same photo of the mini loaves/buns.. -slurp- i finally made my bread today. four days after making the first batch of starter. four. i had made two batches of dough so that i could make the mini “loaves” and a couple regular sized loaves. this time i cut the mini loaves much thinner.. and they came out more like bun size, which was perfect. smaller means that the insides can’t rise out from the base reminiscent of the alien bursting out of that guy’s chest. i didn’t make flaccid geoduck/penis this time. they turned out bakery beautiful! i was amazed. i know today is a holiday for us in the us, but uhmm.. is this also a holiday for the baking gods? or did i just take so damn long that i fooled them into believing that i’d never actually bake the dough?? either way.. it all turned out great! even the regular sized loaves, which i was unsure of because i hadn’t attempted that last time. today is a day to mark on the books. today i beat the shite out of the baking gods. today i made myself proud. today something horrible is going to happen.. so really now.. get off your asses and start digging up your back yard. you can thank me for the head’s up after it’s all over. ;) xoxo the 2010 february daring cooks challenge was hosted by michele of veggie num nums . michele chose to challenge everyone to make mezze based on various recipes from claudia roden, jeffrey alford and naomi dugid. this month's daring cook's challenge brought a whole new culture into my life. i've never eaten anything middle eastern before, although my sister loves it and has been telling me for months that i need to try it. i have to admit, middle eastern fare, never really thrilled me because when i think of that kind of food, i think of beans. -shudder- chickpeas, lentils, black beans.. all of those lil pasty tastin' legumes. if you're new to this here lil blog, then you might not know of my strong dislike of beans. frankly, i'd rather eat live bees. ;) but i am happy to say that i was completely wrong, which is nothing new. :p yes, middle eastern food does contain beans, but there is so much of a variety of other foods - i had no idea! i wanted my mezze to be special, so i called upon my home girls. my g's, if you will. june, blimey & amy - 3 of my favorite people in alla world. as per usual, they were up for it and all agreed to find a middle eastern recipe to bring to the party. yay! i decided to make a cold lebanese carrot salad, green beans (one of the few that i'll eat) lebanese style, kalamata olive tapenade as well as the mandatory hummus and pita bread. june brought a delicious tabouli and amy brought a refreshing and really delicious cucumber raita. unfortunately, blimey got sick so she couldn't join us, and we missed her tremendously. we piled everything onto the kitchen table and started eating immediately. so good! my absolute favorite was the green beans lebanese style. holy cow, i could eat that daily. i wouldn't even share much of the left overs with the gals because i had. to. have. it. the next night with a roasted chicken. delish! i really enjoyed the small bites of everything.. and liked to combine different dishes to see what went best with what. my favorite combo was a lil kalamata tapenade on some pita followed with a lil dab of cucumber raita. salty with a nice tang. -slurp- as for cooking this feast - no problems really at all. i got a lil nervous when my pita didn't balloon up like audax's and it didn't really brown up on top. the bottoms browned up nicely though. and although parts were flat and parts were bubbly it was really good pita. june was the resident middle eastern connoisseur and she said the pita was excellent and she loved the other dishes as well. score! i know it was good food because i realized afterward that we had no meat and didn't even miss it! it wasn't consciously planned that way, but since it happened, i'm going to say we dedicated our vegetarian dinner to michele. :d eating this way is definitely fun - true party food. next i want to do a tapas night and then a dim sum night.. i'm looking forward! michele, thanks so much for turning me on to this delicious food and showing me how easy it is to make pita bread! i'll definitely be making it again! you did an excellent job hosting! love you! check out all the rest of the amazing mezze feasts from our daring cook troops ! just seeing what they've uploaded to the forums makes me all kinds of hungry for mezze all over again! ;) xoxo a few weeks ago, my friend michele and i were talking about recipes and doughnuts came up, like they eventually always do if you're having a conversation with me. :p ahh yes, i love me my doughnuts. but i won't let myself eat them very often. -sigh- i know how bad they are because of their deliciousness. anything that tastes that good is definitely a heart attack or stroke disguised in fluffy goodness covered in powdery sugar or chocolate. or maple. or bacon. or cinnamon sugar. or whipped cream. or just plain for those days when you're trying to eat healthy. ;) so we decided that we must make homemade donuts. this past sunday was d-day. i went with alton brown's recipe . i was a little nervous because, yanno, alton can bring in a lil too much science. but the recipe was straightforward, thank the baby jebus. the only problems i ran into were bad timing and way too hot oil. the timing thing - you need to heat milk to melt the shortening. then you have to wait until it cools to lukewarm because you'll be mixing it with the water/yeast mixture. well the -first- time i did it, i started to heat my milk and immediately poured my yeast into the lukewarm water, not taking into account that after the milk melts the shortening it'll take some time for it to cool off enough to add it to the yeast. doh! you wouldn't believe how fakkin long it takes for hot milk to cool the fug down. jebus. my yeast/water mixture had already bubbled and was sitting on the bottom of my very cold metal kitchenaid bowl. if you listened closely enough you could hear their itty bitty teeth chattering and their itsy bitsy knees knockin'. :( i was blowin' on the milk.. fanning it with a kitchen towel.. put it in the fridge for 10 minutes.. the bottom of the bowl wouldn't cool off. i mean this stuff was hot. so finally, we (hubbs was present) decided to put the damn bowl out in a snow drift. i mean, seriously. it's not like we were trying to cool off gallons of milk.. it was just a cup or so for crissakes, but it wouldn't cool down. and no, this had nothing to do with my desire to be eating warm, fluffy, mouth-wateringly, rings of yumminess. much. 'kay well maybe it had a lot to do with my impatience over having to wait for the prize, but i tell you - that milk was volcano hot. outside it went. :p okay well what are two people to do while waiting on milk to cool? they get all caught up in animal planet's puppy bowl vi is what they do. we couldn't peel our eyes away from the cuteness if we tried. ohmygod. chubby puppy bellies! wagging puppy tails! floppy puppy ears!!! much more delicious than any doughnut! and when we finally did remember there was molten hot milk sitting in a snow drift on our back deck, this gal jumped up immediately, tripped over her dog, caught herself before completing a full face plant into the arm of the loveseat and then promptly tripped over the blanket she had been cuddled under while watching oodles of puppies attacking each other and stuffed footballs. that was more exercise than i've had in weeks. gah. as you might have guessed, the shortening was no longer liquefied. it sat in greasy lumps in the ice cold milk. mmm hmmm... meanwhile.. my yeast had passed on to the great bread bakery in the sky. it was a pitiful scene. no bubbles. just murky muck sitting on the bottom of the bowl. -sigh- so i cleaned up my lil yeasty dead soldiers, put the milk back on the burner until the shortening just started to melt. waited 10 minutes and then brought yeast and lukewarm water back together again. after all of that, putting the dough together was a snap. the waiting was the hard part.. at one point i felt like standing in front of the bowl containing the dough ball and screaming "hurry the fakk up for crissakes!! doughnuts! hungry! nom nom nom!!!" once i had them shaped and rising the last time, i heated my oil in a wok. i knew it was kinda hot, but i didn't want a greasy doughnut, so i figured a little hotter than it called for would be a good thing. and it was. although they came out a little darker than you'd see in a doughnut shop, they weren't burnt or greasy. they were light and fluffy and uber delish. i did a good job of refraining from putting a platter on the table, throwing my hair up into a ponytail, putting my hands behind my back and doing my best impression of a pig feeding in the trough. it was hard though. delicious homemade doughnuts, still warm and covered in cinnamon sugar.. oh. my. god. soooooooooooo good. it's super easy to make doughnuts and home and really the waiting isn't all that bad - 1.5 hours total rise time is all it calls for. you can make several varieties with one batch of dough and depending on size, you can get quite a few doughnuts. the only way i can describe the size of mine is they were the size of doughnuts you buy prepackaged in a grocery store.. like from pepperidge farms if anyone is familiar. i didn't have a doughnut cutter, nor even a round cutter. so i used a wine glass and to cut the middles out, i used the cap of a 2 liter bottle of soda. har! worked like a charm! :) i used the scraps to make twists. we were going to fill some of them, but that didn't happen for whatever reason. i know these doughnuts freeze well too. course i wouldn't know that from this experience. i packaged them in freezer bags and left on the counter overnight because it was too dark for photos after they came out of the oil. and after i took photos the next day, i put them back into the bags and then something else caught my attention.. oh look! a chicken! that night they were pretty much stale. so eat 'em quick or freeze 'em soon! go check out michele's doughnuts! she filled hers with yummy stuff! :) xoxoxo okay not really.. but he's the only winter olympian that i know of. and frankly, i'm not even sure he's in the olympics this year.. is he? what i do know is i like his long wavy red hair. but i probably shouldn't say that out loud as i'm most likely old enough to be his aunt. -cough- anyhoo.. as per usual, i'm a day late and a dollar short. and once again i feel foolish because of it. this month's daring baker challenge was a breeze and the results were muy deliciouso! wait, that's spanish.. what would the canadians say? uhmm.. 'kay.. well.. the results were kick ass! (that's more of what i'd say because i don't know what a canuck would say. canuck.. is that pc?) the january 2010 daring bakers’ challenge was hosted by lauren of celiac teen . lauren chose gluten-free graham wafers and nanaimo bars as the challenge for the month. the sources she based her recipe on are 101 cookbooks and www.nanaimo.ca. lauren is from canada and these nanaimo bars are her tribute to the 2010 winter olympics held in vancouver, canada. here's a funny.. and he's probably going to kill me.. but i received an email this morning from my friend john who had to tell me that while he was making his dough for the graham crackers he noticed that it smelled like graham crackers. and then he said, "really?? you think??." yes gorgeous, the dough does smell like graham crackers and after baked, they taste better than any graham cracker i've ever had. addicting is the word. more like graham crack. i kept hearing, er, reading in the forums that other members couldn't stop eating the graham crackers and my friend michele said the same thing - but i had no. idea. how. good. they really are. i was almost sad to have to crumble a bunch of them for the nanaimo bars. seriously. but i did.. and then i kinda veered off the traditional route and went down my own road. i've made nanaimo bars before and they were delish, you'll get no argument from me there. but they were a leeetle sweet so this time i wanted to make all of the components but in different flavors - specifically flavors that aren't as sweet. i started with the graham cracker crust, and omitted the nuts as we can't eat them. i also ground the coconut to almost a powder because i had to hide it as hubbs hates coconut with a passion. he'll eat stuff flavored with coconut but hates real coconut. go figger. and i added a generous peench of cinnamon. what i didn't do was add the cocoa. this was entirely an accident. i was so intent on grinding down that coconut and getting it into the crust before he came back into the kitchen that i completely forgot the damn cocoa. i really did want a chocolate crust. then i moved on to the filling, which is what i found too sweet in the traditional bars. i decided i wanted a blast of coffee with the tang of cheese. ideally i was going to do mascarpone/butter cream frosting flavored with espresso powder. but i never got the chance to get the mascarpone, so i had to do with cream cheese. basically i made cream cheese frosting sans most of the sugar - i probably used 1/3 of what a basic cream cheese frosting would call for, then thinned it a bit with a boat load of espresso powder stirred into a small amount of hot heavy whipping cream. i can't find the words to express how fakking good it turned out and i really can't wait to use it on a cake! for the topping, ya'll know me, right? i don't say no to any kind of chocolate unless it's white - which is not chocolate anyways. but just a few weeks ago, i made a pan of what is essentially buckeyes (the lil round gobs of delicious sweetened peanut butter dipped in chocolate), but instead of rolling out the peanut butter into balls, because i'm a lazy mofo, i just spread it into an 8 x 8 pan and poured the chocolate over it. after refrigerating the chocolate became hard (duh) and well.. after forcing myself to eat 3/4 of the pan myself, i was kinda over hard chocolate with something mooshey underneath. :p so i went with a basic ganache over the top of my coffee/cream cheese filling. as you can see in this picture, there is a bite taken. that is the one and only taste of these that i've had (so far) and it took every fiber of restraint in this chubby body of mine to stop there to rush into my office to write this post a day late. and keep in mind, i don't own very many restraint fibers. :p holy mother of a chinless baboon, these bars are fanfarkingtastic. they aren't nearly as sweet as the traditional nanaimo bars, but they are definitely rich, and i'm confident that i can get over that. :p the cinnamon & coconut in the crust paired with the coffee and chocolate and the tang of the cream cheese is nothing if not heavenly. lauren, thank you so much for choosing these recipes and for allowing us the creativity to choose different flavors. i just hope i can restrain myself until saturday evening as i've promised these bars as dessert for friends who are coming over.. but then again if i just whip up another batch, who will be the wiser? ;) pop on over here for the recipes for the grahams (gluten free and made with wheat flour versions) and the traditional nanaimo bar recipes! xoxo okay so i can't win. i either am stressing to get a daring kitchen challenge done at the last minute, or i get it done way early and then something happens where i can't get to my lil blog to post on the damn reveal date. wtf? the january 2010 daring cooks' challenge was hosted by cuppy of cuppylicious and she chose a delicious thai-inspired recipe for pork satay from the book 1000 recipes by martha day. huge apologies to cuppy - i feel as if i have failed our host(s) miserably when i'm late to get a post up.. this wasn't intentional! and now i am seriously pressed for time - but the good news is, there was no disaster this month, so i really don't have a long post full of expletives and "whoa is me" whining. ;) i made chicken satay using cuppy's longer version marinade and it didn't even look remotely appetizing as i was transferring my chicken strips (breasts sliced into strips) from the bag of marinade to the broiling pan (grill was under 2 feet of snow..) all yellow and stuff. but i kept an open mind, lord knows i've been happily surprised often in the past with these daring cooks challenges! i had made my peanut sauce earlier due to time constraints and was warming it up again, while the chicken was under the broiler, when it separated. i had a small pan of peanut solid and peanut oil. ewww. i was very dismayed over it, but thanks to my experience of making buttercream 59 gajillion times, i decided not to panic and to just get out my trusty balloon whisk and start whisking. luckily it all came together again - only now it was almost like peanut fudge, which isn't a bad thing - just something i wouldn't normally pair with chicken. ;) thanks to the amazing support we receive on the private forums of the daring kitchen, my question of why it separated was answered by robert of an alaskan cook's exploration of food and technique - and he thought that i had too much heat going on. and he was most likely right, i did have the heat up pretty high now that i think of it. stupid on my part. again, i persevered and continued on with dinner, making a batch of basmati rice to go with. once it was all done, yeah it still didn't look that great. my chicken was even more yellow and my sauce was no longer sauce-y. at this point, i could have binned it all and declared it a disaster, but i was hungry dammit. so i plated, called hubbs to the kitchen and got a giggle from the expression on his face. he was not amused. he must have been hungry too. hehehe i decided to take my dinner into my office so i could watch a movie (and mainly because i wasn't in the mood to hear him bitch about how awful the food was). surprisingly.. this dinner was out of this world. i cannot express how much i lurved it! suffice to say that it's been well over a week since i've made chicken satay with peanut sauce and a day hasn't gone by that i haven't craved it. unfortunately, hubbs wasn't as impressed (most likely because he turns his nose up at any form of chicken. he'll eat it but not happily.) and that's the only reason i haven't cooked this dinner several times since my first taste. but my cravings will win soon - they always do - and he'll just have to get over it. ;) i always thank our hosts at the end of my posts, but this time i really need to lay on the lurve. cuppy jumped in when, at the last minute, our slated january host couldn't do it. cuppy had no time and yet she came up with a well written recipe and plan for all diets. this was a quick challenge, that was most gratefully received after the busy and hectic holidays and i now have a new favorite quick meal to throw together after a stressful day at work. and yes, this recipe has been "westernized" and is not an authentic thai recipe, but it's delicious regardless. i seriously cannot wait to make it again! thanks so much, cuppy!! :) xoxo the december 2009 daring bakers’ challenge was brought to you by anna of very small anna and y of lemonpi . they chose to challenge daring bakers’ everywhere to bake and assemble a gingerbread house from s
Male: 100%, Male, there's been a lot of talk recently about this brrreeeport thing... traffic has been slow to nfk ever since the pixels fad died down but let's see if this does anything to bring more people to the blog! -steve- we got a nice mention in the wall street journal today. alex tew is auctioning off the last 1000 pixels of the million dollar homepage and the author mentioned some of the other pixel sites. if you would like to support the cause, please donate as little as $5 to help. -steve- bidders vie to purchase last web-screen sections; copycat sites now abound january 10, 2006; page b8 in late november, this column talked about alex tew, a 21-year-old british man who, in a quest to fund his university studies, had arrived at the seemingly outlandish idea of creating a web site and selling advertising in the form of "pixels" -- the simplest graphical denominator of a computer screen -- for a buck each. his goal: one million dollars. what made the story noteworthy then was that mr. tew had already passed the halfway mark despite having no target audience or even the slightest bit of brand recognition. as of tomorrow, mr. tew could not only reach his million-dollar goal, he could surpass it by auctioning off the last 1,000 pixels for www.milliondollarhomepage.com on ebay. further, mr. tew's business model has inspired hundreds, perhaps thousands, of copycat sites angling to find a new twist on pixel sales for whatever their needs may be. alex tew, creator of milliondollarhomepage.com, and his father, malcolm tew, pictured the weekend before alex's last pixels are auctioned on ebay. as an entrepreneurial venture, mr. tew's stands out given his young age, global influence and quick return on an estimated $40,000 investment to host and publicize the site. on aug. 26, mr. tew launched his home page and divided the screen into 10,000 small squares of 100 pixels each. he sold pixels for $1 each, with a minimum order of 100 pixels and promised to keep the page alive for at least five years. in each space, buyers could put a graphical ad of their choosing, linking it to their own site. today the home page resembles a cluttered collage of ads in various shapes and colors. internet celebrity meantime, mr. tew himself has taken on celebrity status in the internet community. world-wide solicitations have swamped his email in-box; he says there are currently 10,000-plus unanswered messages soliciting him for everything from money and business advice to job positions. getty images, which provides film and photo images to media outlets and others, just conducted a portrait session with mr. tew and his parents in cricklade, england. in fact, all the attention has persuaded mr. tew to postpone his university studies -- an ironic turn of events given that school was the original impetus for his project. "i never expected the site to reach the level of success it has done," he writes in an email. "but i can't see how i can realistically continue my studies in the immediate future -- due to the sheer scale of interest in my site, and all the new opportunities that have presented themselves as a result. there just isn't time now." he says he will return to school in september. by the end of 2005, mr. tew had sold 999,000 pixels and demand outstripped supply for the last thousand. on dec. 30, the page had one million unique visitors and mr. tew's server almost died, he says, forcing him to temporarily suspend order taking. giddy prospective buyers pushed him to open a second page, but mr. tew had pledged to close the page when his goal of one million dollars was reached in order to protect its originality. final auction so over the new year, mr. tew decided to do what any calculating businessman might: he put the last 1,000 pixels up for sale on ebay. the auction ends tomorrow at 1:42 p.m. est; as of 6 p.m. last night, the highest offer from a pool of bidders handpicked by mr. tew was $160,109.09. he expects to net about $650,000 to $700,000 after costs, taxes and a donation he plans to give to the prince's trust, a u.k. charity for youth that once helped him. mr. tew's efforts benefited from newness, shrewd marketing and the internet's lightning-speed word of mouth. after first persuading his friends and family to buy pixels to make the page seem legitimate, he then began touting his site, and himself, to bloggers, who directed traffic mr. tew's way. the media in britain picked up on his venture, fueling more visitors. in mid-september, mr. tew's web site landed on the "movers & shakers" feature of alexa.com, which ranks the world's web sites by the number of people who visit them. marketing executives often troll alexa.com, which is owned by amazon.com, to check out what's hot and what's not, and at one point mr. tew's site reached alexa's no. 2 spot. that brought in a new wave of advertisers. in october, a u.s. publicist named imal wagner contacted him about penning his life story; he declined but hired her to help him with a u.s. media tour. pixel mania the attention inspired rival sites. one attractive 22-year-old siberian emergency worker has posted her own black-and-white photo on a home page; as people buy pixels on www.presentmecolor.com the image metamorphoses to color. at www.boxofstars.com two filmmakers are selling digital "stars" -- orbs of light of various hues and size that bounce about the home page and link to other sites -- to raise $50,000 and finance their picture. in a marriage of online and outdoor advertising, www.stickermyhummer.com encourages buyers to purchase ads on an online picture of the body of a hummer h2; when that's filled the site's owner, a california state university student promises he'll buy a real one and wrap it in a graphical composite of the ads. there are charity sites, sites devoted to erotica, and plain-vanilla financial web sites all using pixels to raise funds. an indiana university student has even launched a parody site called www.trumpingalex.com , complete with a fake image of mr. tew sporting donald trump-esque hair. while none of these seem to have replicated mr. tew's success, and it's unclear if they ever will, the sheer volume of attempts and creative juice behind them paints an interesting picture of collective online entrepreneurship around the globe. and at the very least, it suggests there will be an eventual shakeout of what works, and what doesn't. for instance, one site, www.worldofpersia.com , targets a single ethnic group and purports to have sold 1,900 pixels in two days. two carnegie mellon students started www.nickelsforkatrina.org to raise money for hurricane victims. meantime, people are tweaking their pages' graphical elements to stand out: a frenchman launched www.monpremiermillion.com where people place ads on a map of his homeland and www.yournameonthemoon.com solicits people to post missives on a lunar image. currently, mr. tew is holed up at home in cricklade with his mom and dad, monitoring his auction on a 17-inch hewlett-packard laptop from his parents' living room and sleeping from 5 a.m. till 9 a.m. to keep up with u.s. time zones. his folks screen his calls -- their son's numbers got posted on the internet -- and siblings helped sort through the last round of orders. mr. tew says he paid them. says his 58-year-old dad, malcolm tew: "alexander has always had lots and lots of ideas, some good and some not so good. this is certainly the most, ah, fruitful." write to gwendolyn bounds at wendy.bounds@wsj.com we got written up today in the pittsburgh post gazette. http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05329/611718.stm sorry for the sparse posting. the last couple weeks at school have been pretty busy and we haven't had much time to work on the site. our official count is up to $2,555 and we're trying to drive some more traffic in the coming weeks. the group i went to mississippi with is following up with the people we helped out and we will be presenting a report on our trip to the university. i will have an update on this in a week or so. there was an interesting article in the wall street journal today about the pixels phenomenon. unfortunately, they didn't mention us but it sheds some light on the wave of interest around such an arbitrary thing. http://online.wsj.com/article/sb113261806930503580.html?mod=technology_main_promo_right pipe dream how selling pixels may yield a million bucks november 22, 2005; page b1 it was just a few months ago that 21-year-old alex tew of great britain was stumped about how to pay for college. he'd filled a notebook with ideas before jotting down this simple, if rather audacious, query to himself: how can i become a millionaire? in the annals of entrepreneurship, what followed is an instructional tale of how a brainstorm, coupled with the internet's powerful word-of-mouth culture, can set a trend in motion with lightning speed. mr. tew says his strategy was to find an idea simple to understand and cheap to set up, with a catchy name that would garner attention online, where he gained experience from having free-lanced as a web designer for a few years. ultimately, his solution amounted to making money via internet advertising -- but with a twist. instead of selling banner ads, text links or splashy videolike ads that fill a screen, mr. tew opted to hawk the simplest graphical denominator of a computer screen: the pixel. a pixel is a tiny dot of light and color, and each screen has tens of thousands of them. mr. tew created a home page, www.milliondollarhomepage.com , where he divided the screen into 10,000 small squares of 100 pixels each. his plan: to sell the pixels for $1 a piece, with a minimum order of 100 pixels. in each space, buyers could put a graphical ad of their choosing that links to their own site when clicked on. the end result is a cluttered collage of ads in various shapes and colors all amassed on a single digital billboard. (mr. tew doesn't charge his advertisers anything when a visitor clicks on the ads.) mr. tew pledged to keep the site up for at least five years and to close the page when his goal of one million dollars was reached. "i had to think big," he says. the notion seemed absurd. who would want to advertise on an unknown site that had no target audience, no track record of attracting visitors or even the slightest brand recognition? but as with many gimmicks, its newness gave it legs, as did mr. tew's shrewd marketing. he first roped his friends and family into buying pixels and placing ads to make the page seem legitimate. he then began touting his site, and himself, to bloggers, who wrote about his crazy idea and linked to the site, which directed traffic his way. the media in britain picked up on his efforts, fueling more visitors. within two weeks of the site's aug. 26 launch mr. tew says he sold $40,000 in ads. more important, the traffic numbers started gaining attention among the u.s. internet community. since its launch, the site has received a total of about 1.5 million unique visitors. in mid-september, it landed on the "movers & shakers" feature of alexa.com, which ranks the world's web sites by the number of people who visit them. marketing executives often troll alexa.com, which is owned by amazon.com, to check out what's hot and what's not, and at one point mr. tew's site reached alexa's no. 2 spot. currently, the site gets 600,000 to 700,000 unique visitors a month. as of yesterday evening, mr. tew said he was $623,800 toward his goal, more than enough to pay for college and earmark some cash for his next entrepreneurial venture, he says. (he keeps a running tally of his sales on the web site, and though the figure can't be independently verified, screenshots emailed by mr. tew of his paypal and other checkout accounts appear to support his claim.) while there's also no way of knowing for sure whether mr. tew is the first entrepreneur to sell pixels, the idea was new enough that it felt that way to onlookers. "i was like, 'what's this?' " says daniel khesin, vice president of marketing at ds laboratories inc., a skin-care company in lake success, n.y. after examining mr. tew's site, he says: "there was nothing inherently special about the page, but it was very obvious to us that at the very least, buying some pixels would be a good idea for the sheer number of visitors he was getting." ds laboratories purchased 800 pixels. almost overnight, he says, traffic surged at the company's web site by twentyfold, and all of the increase came from milliondollarhomepage.com. more impressive, he says, sales by internet companies that ds laboratories' site links to jumped almost 50% within a week of the ad going up. "our skepticism was that this is untargeted traffic," mr. khesin says. "but this advertising has definitely paid for itself many times forward. and unlike banner advertising where it goes away, people will always know where to find it to go back and purchase more products." similarly, chris magras, president evisions marketing inc. in tempe, ariz., which helps web sites get higher rankings on search services, also noted milliondollarhomepage.com's movement on alexa.com. "some people would say it's a bad idea, some would say it's a good one. all i know is that it was generating interest," mr. magras says. evisions bought 6,400 pixels and its ad went up on a friday. the following monday morning, evisions was getting 2,000 more unique visitors to its home page, all linked directly from milliondollarhomepage.com. the number of leads, or visitors filling out personal information on the evisions site, jumped to 300 a day from 100. "it was quality traffic," mr. magras says. "it was definitely the biggest payoff for a one-stop ad buy we've ever had." he adds that the company is still getting 800 to 1,000 new visitors daily from mr. tew's site. copycats popped up almost immediately; now there are hundreds of web sites selling pixels, some of them directly crediting mr. tew -- and even linking to his site. some advertisers have put out press releases touting their alliances with mr. tew's site, further helping spike his traffic. the risk, of course, is that as the original pixel concept gets mimicked, it will suffer from brand dilution and become a less compelling a business model. what's more, as milliondollarhomepage.com has filled up, it's become harder for advertisers to stand out amid a busy screen with messages ranging from "casinoscams" and "free ringtones" to "jesus" and "hypnosis"; the smallest ad spaces, at 100-pixels square, are nearly indecipherable at this point. whether mr. tew reaches a million dollars remains to be seen. he readily notes that he'd never do another site like the original. now, he says, "the copycats are all competing with each other." one is moneypants.com , a personal finance web site geared toward women that says it has 600 members and has collected $4,500 over the last few weeks from its own pixel "dream page" -- a decent chunk of change for a nascent enterprise. "it's very compelling," says moneypants chief executive komal bhojwani. "we don't have to end up going the investor route, which might require us to make changes to the business that we don't want to make. and we didn't have to get into debt by borrowing from a bank. we are generating revenue and not expenses." one advertiser, cherryl weaver, says she's seen a 13% jump in traffic to her real estate web site, www.hotlaneighborhoods.com , from the 1,500 moneypants.com pixels she bought. "as long as it's a strategic alliance, it makes sense," ms. weaver says, alluding to the affinity between a personal-finance site and real estate. "would i team up with mcdonald's if they did a dream page? no." meantime, james thomson, a web designer in branson, mo., says he's wiped out $30,000 in personal debt accumulated after the dot-come bust with his site, www.millionpennyhomepage.com , by selling pixels by the penny, instead of the dollar. yesterday, he had only $974 left to go before reaching his goal of $10,000. and christian abad, president of accessible computing inc. in charlotte, n.c., is trying to lure new clients to his pixel page, called www.pixelads4all.com , by giving them a 50% discount off their pixel purchases. sales have been slow, but he remains optimistic about the overall concept and has even purchased 11 domain names in anticipation of a future in pixel advertising. among them: pixelads4shopping.com and pixelads4porn.com. for his part, mr. tew says he wants to keep milliondollarhomepage.com online "forever." if and when a million pixels are sold, he says he'll leave the page frozen in time, no changes allowed, no new buyers permitted. his ultimate goal is as lofty as the original concept: he hopes his site will be like a time capsule showing "what's possible on the internet" -- an iconic image that he imagines "one day might be a piece of art in a museum." write to gwendolyn bounds at wendy.bounds@wsj.com this week was a pretty positive week for us. getting listed on the blogs of note was great for our traffic and we've been logging about 300 uniques per day to the main site. we've broken $2275 and we should have it all updated by tonight. few ideas being tossed around right now...one of them brought to our attention has been broadening the scope of where we put our donations. although katrina needs financial help, there are other natural disasters occuring in the us and around the world. all of the money would still got the red cross, but we would donate it into different hurricane reliefs such as wilma, rita and the earthquakes in pakistan. please post some comments in the forums and let us know what you think. any name change ideas? thank you to everyone who has been buying up pixels. your support is appreciated. we've been getting some interesting donors from sites such as save the ta-tas and doombuggies . wouldn't it be funny if someone bought up pixels to propose...like on the megatron at a baseball game? -steve and keith- for the final leg of our time in mississippi we were supposed to be working on projects further south, towards new orleans. because of how day-to-day things happen, however, these projects were unable to happen. on our way back i got some pictures of the damage that is still evident in the area. the golden arches - just about all of the street signs were blown out like this. it is shocking to see miles of commercial areas with businesses that still have not fully recovered from the disaster. we passed by a cvs that was operating out of a trailer. it is amazing that when people need something like medicine, quick and dirty solutions are thrown up to fill that need. the weekend spent in mississippi was a great experience. in the short time that we were there, we were able to make an impact. although not all of the projects we lined up happened as planned, just being able to help others in need made the trip worth it. a student group on campus, alternative break will be making a follow-up trip to the region in the beginning of january. on a side note, none of the money for this trip came out of nickelsforkatrina.org . this was a trip organized by the division of student affairs at carnegie mellon university. with the generous help of shernell smith and rowshawn palmer, we were able to get it together on such short notice. thank you to everyone who has been reading, commenting, donating and putting up our banner. your support is appreciated. -steve and keith- free cellphones for katrina victims : "the fcc has approved a plan by the feds to give all katrina evacuees free cellphones with 300 minutes of talk time. now i'm sure they're not handing out pink razrs to those in need so it's not an issue of logistics. so when did katrina happen? oh right, almost 2 months ago. i'm sure if someone needed a cellphone, they'd have it by now. what about people affected by more recent hurricanes like wilma? there's trouble in paradise down in floridia and i'm sure they could use those hot cingular and tracfone phones right about now. anyway, enough kvetching. the offer is open to every household approved for housing assistance by the federal emergency management agency, according to the fcc. give 'em a call if you need something... oh. that's right. just hit the web... oh. poop. feds give out free phones to katrina evacuees [textually]" we got some more donations to the site yesterday. one that we thought was particularly interesting is another non-profit: save the ta-tas . they sell clever t-shirts to benefit breast cancer. their link is in the upper left hand corner of the site . be sure to check them out. 
Female: 100%, Female,  don't call for the sake of calling never try calling someone working for a company unless you know their full name. chances that you are going to get through their receptionist are slim: this i learned some weeks ago when i tried to get hold of a marketing manager of a swedish company based in shanghai. the receptionist told me “he” (that later turned out to be a she!) was out and that she didn’t know what time “he’d” be back. i tried other people: -somebody else working with marketing? -not available. -some swedish person working there? -at a business trip. would be back earliest in 2 months (!). -the manager!? -in a meeting all day. i soon realized it was useless. it didn’t matter who i asked for –even the cleaning lady was completely unavailable since i didn’t know her last name. i had two other people calling trying the same thing before we all gave up and decided to call the head office in sweden. via them (because there, surprise, surprise, you can actually talk to people when you call!) we got the name of someone working in beijing, and via the beijing woman, we finally got the name of the marketing manager in shanghai. next time i called i got through straight away. and when i went for a meeting there one day later, i miraculously met several swedes working away at their desks: - oh, recently got back from your trip?! i inquired.  -trip? they said, looking at me as if i was from another planet.  in other words: don’t try calling someone working over here unless you know their name. the receptionists can be quite tough, working like a spam filter and only letting through those that are “inside enough” to know who’s doing what. i'm going far away from this kind of scene... finally, we booked a trip to somewhere... that is totally random! i swear, you guys are going to think i'm odd who's travelling to this particular place at this time of the year. it's not really the "ideal" place to visit, however, i'm always keen on seeing something completely new, hence why i picked it. can tell you this much -there will be a lot of nature and hopefully also some pretty awesome (but different) food! not to mention some severe temperature differences between night and day....! anyone who can guess where i'm headed?  update: for those that cannot be bothered to read the comments, some of you guessed right. i'm off to inner mongolia! most wanted joint i spent saturday in suzhou –packing and cleaning. we are definitely staying in china for some time still, but our new shanghai flat is much smaller than the one we had in suzhou –so a lot of stuff has to go. after a saturday full of throwing away stuff we felt fed up with being locked inside and got ready to take the 5.30pm train to shanghai. we walked out on our yard, carrying large bags, and being quite in a hurry when we saw a group of four chinese -3 women and one man, with so much hair wax in his hair that it looked like glue- stepping out of a car. - heeeeey! laowai, laowai! the wax-man yelled, and we, thinking it was just the ordinary “hello laowai” moment, continued walking without paying them any attention. ..that was until i suddenly heard the wax man literally call for us. - please wait laowai, i have a question! we turned around, facing the wax man and three older ladies. - you live in that building over there right? the man said, pointing at our building. -yes. -and you are moving out very soon? -yes. -that’s what i thought. so today i brought this 3 ladies to show them your flat! he proudly gestured to three small ladies at his right side. - ehhh… -can we go and see it now!? one lady asked. - er, we are going to shanghai, i said, nodding towards my large shoulder bag. - ah ok … said the man. but can’t you show us the flat before you go? -we don’t have time! we are catching the train. -oh… no time…. the wax man sounded seriously disappointed. - what time is your train , one of the women said. i am sure you have time to show us the flat before that. -the train is leaving quite soon, we have to go now actually, i said. we don’t have time to show you our flat (“how about calling first?!” i wanted to screem). -that is a shame, the wax man said, looking at us as if we were enemies. so when will you be back then?! (just as if we had broken a non-existent appointment?!) - well… we are… ah, why don’t you just call me next time?! my bf said.  - ah.. ok. you want me to call you. i understand, the wax man said. -a re you sure you don’t have time to show us the flat? one of the ladies urged. you will still make your train. it’s fast to get to the train station from here! they all smiled, and one of them attempted to pull my sleeve. i gave her a dark look. enough with the bull-sh-t. and we left. just imagine that, huh? you take three ladies on a house hunt on a saturday afternoon, however, you forget to inform the current tenants, so instead you jump on the first laowais you see on a parking lot?! (our living area is huge, there are at least 40 buildings in there!). fortunately they are the “right ones.” then you try and convince them to show you their flat even though you know they’ll miss their train if they linger?! if that’s not random i don’t know what is?! one would think this was a serious aerobic class in full throttle. and i guess it was. but not for everyone: apparently, the aerobic class, with bom-ba-da-bom-tunes blasting from the speakers, was also a perfect place for reading a book! who would have guessed?! not me, anyway.  when i say i need a run, i mean it i’ve had a bit of a rough week, with a lot of stuff going on, making my mood anything but stable. yesterday i decided that no matter how much work there was on my desk by the end of the day, i would still hit the gym in order to burn some energy. i kept my promise… but just as i was about to leave for the gym a strange feeling hit me.. did i really pack all my training clothes? i decided to have a look, and very well. i had packed all my training clothes, except for a sport’s bra. there’s no way (on earth) that i will hit a gym wearing a normal bra, so the remaining question was: could i bother going home, picking up a sport’s bra, and then head back to the gym? (it’s definitely not on the way, rather, i live in the opposite direction) however, after a moment of mental self-consulting, i decided that i very well could. so i went home, found what i needed, spent extra time on a crammed metro and arrived at the gym one hout later than planned, but hyped about the thought of hitting the treadmill. i had dinner plans at 8pm, so i went over to the reception and asked to “rent” a towel a 5 kuai so that i could shower and head out straight after my workout. imagine my surprise when the (rude!) guy behind the desk said: -no towels today. if it would have been any other day i might have shrugged my shoulders and left, slightly annoyed. this particular day, however, his words made me see red. -that’s impossible! that’s not okay! i need a towel. i need to work out! (again, i normally don’t yell at people, but…) - well sorry, we don’t have any. -no, this is not okay. you always have towels. if you suddenly decide not to have towels you need to inform your customers in advance so that we can bring some ourselves! i didn’t bring a towel today just because i thought i could “rent” one from here! -well… -well you have to find me a towel. i am not leaving. i need a towel otherwise i cannot workout. -eh.. maybe you should speak to the manager? -yeah, where is he or she? -eh… he will come in 3 min. i waited for 3 minutes, feeling angrier by the minute. i simply refused to just go home.  the reception guy was really annoying: - i know this situation is really annoying… (he said it in a sarcastic way). - very. -why don’t you go and workout first, have a shower and then come and see if we have found you a towel? -what?! how am i going to shower without a towel?! ( i wanted to say "do you want me to walk out naked and ask if you have now found me a towel?!" but i don't know the chinese word for naked, so i left it like that) (i guess his suggestion here was: "why don’t you do like all the other girls at this gym and dry yourself off with the hairdryer once you come out of the shower"). then, 2 girls suddenly arrived (manager?). the reception guy told the girls they needed to find “this laowai” (pointing at me) a towel. - there are no towels , the girls said. - there have to be towels! i know there are, somewhere! i don’t care what kind, you just have to find me a towel! -but there are no! -please. try! the girls sighed, rolled her eyes and went away, only to come back 30 seconds later…. carrying a large, white, towel! - oh, i found one. oh my, oh my. at that point, however, i was too relieved to continue bitching about their lousy attitude towards problem solving, i simply accepted the towel and went to the ladies changing room. once at the gym all the treadmills were busy. however, i didn’t even consider the thought of giving up this workout, or settling for anything else but running. i simply located a girl who was walking along to a clock ticking down (she only had 4 min left), and i was rude enough to stand behind her and wait for her to finish and get off. a number of people realized what i was doing. some laughed, some pointed, and some tried to sneak in between when they realized the girl would be done soon! but i was faster and once i got up there i enjoyed the best 7km run i’ve done in ages… ahhhh. relieeeeeef! once i made that 8pm dinner i felt rather proud of myself and my  nagging-attitude. if there’s a will there’s a way –this appeals to most of the “impossible to solve ”-situations in china. it's not as if i have not been told that i "cannot run" before...  a captured metro moment from 2007 fellow metro-commuters in shanghai, have you noticed lately (at least during the morning rush) that more and more people nowadays stand on the right hand side of escalators?! that way, it’s almost as efficient ( hold your horses, i said almost ) as the london underground system (where i believe you stand to the left, but i might be wrong?) where you literally get walked over if you accidently stand on the “walking hand side” of the escalator. of course, there are still a few cases of people (ok, not just a few, more like… some millions) standing on the left hand side when you come walking, but with a gentle push/tap on the shoulder, a good 90% immediately move to the side to let you through. good stuff.  unfortunately not all people are as friendly/helpful. i’ve had cases where i’ve gently tapped the other person’s shoulder (in 98% of the cases it's been middle-aged chinese men), and said something like “不好意思（bu haoyisi= pardon me)” indicating i want to be let through. but do they move? oh no?! in one case, the man turned around, looked at me, and stood like a brick of stone on his spot, refusing to even let me squeeze between him and that person to the right. (when he started pushing me back with violence i decided to give up). still, a great improvement from previous years, so shanghai metro –i have hope! one thing i still wish people could relax a little bit about is getting on/off the metro. the other day we had a work-dinner after work, and me and a few colleagues caught the metro just one stop to get to the restaurant. we were a group of five, and since the metro was quite full we stood just at the door. i immediately felt the push from behind, some guy that tried to squeeze in between us to stand just at the door, so i turned around and told him that we too were getting off at the next station. he looked like he understood, and for a short second he stood back… until something must have hit him (maybe that eagerness to stand at the door) so he still decided to elbow his way through our little group and catch the spot just at the door. (guess he’d been taught never to trust laowais?). the funniest cases are still all those people that push like mad in the metro, run off the metro as if their houses were on fire, and then, finally, when they get to the escalator –they just stand there, rather than continuing moving upwards. speaking off the metro –shanghai’s new metro system (with new lines and plenty of new stations) is simply g-r-e-a-t n-e-w-s-! i’m loving every little bit of it, especially line 7 that’s now connected to line 1’s changshu lu. simply great. me and my significant other are planning a metro-exploring weekend someday in april/may (when you don’t freeze your fingers off every time you step out the door) where we are going to spend 2 days catching all new lines, getting off at stops we’ve never heard off before and explore the surrounding. we used to do this at the magazine where i worked back in 2007, and it's not as bad as it sounds... you actually get to see quite a lot of new stuff. i promise to report back to you afterwards. whatever you do -as a girl- only pay attention to the guys sometimes, china’s just so funny. while western guys can receive an unlimited amount of compliments over here (from men as well as from women), there’s a clear line when it comes to women. the other day i went shopping with four chinese girlfriends. we are not super close, but have known each other for some years still. they are all a bit younger than me, and especially one of them (her name is luna) really likes me and the fact that i’m tall, blonde, and big-nosed. we went into some shops and were all trying on clothes. i had one of those good (and rare) days when everything fits, and my dear friend luna simply would not hold back on the compliments: -ah, jonna, you look so great in everything you try on today! -that’s perfect on you! -you’ve got a great figure! i was blushing/”nail-nali-ing”/”bu gandang-ing”/and so on (yeah, accepting a compliment is simply not my thing, especially not here in china) until one of the other chinese girls decided she’d had enough: - what’s the matter with you luna, the way you speak to jonna one would think you have a crush on her?! -come on… i’m just saying she looks good in this dress. -no you’re not. i think you like her.  -yeah, i think you do! another one filled in. you've been speaking to her as if you like her all day long! (yikes. uncomfortable situation number one. chinese girls are fighting over if one of them has a crush on me or not?! and all she did was paying me some compliments?) -i don’t, come on. -well, so how come you don’t have a boyfriend. -i have not found one i like. -well maybe you like girls. maybe you have a big problem… -hahhaha, well well, shall we all go for lunch?! (i decided it was time to step in and change the subject -and what better way to do so than distract them with lunch?). however, the conversations continued over the food when luna asked me if i wanted to try her salmon pasta (we were having a wagas lunch). -seeeeeeeeee….. you totally like her!!! you've got a problem! you like girls! both me and luna sighed. man! there’s no way to get a compliment over here, is there? what a weekend! since i’ve now been living in shanghai for 2 months, we decided that it was time to throw a small housewarming party. now, housewarming parties are not really a unique kind, so in order to do something different we decided to have a theme at our party, namely “bad taste.” shopping proved to be the best part of it all. we headed straight to the small shops on fuxing lu where i tried on everything from flower-power pants to zebra meets leopard dresses. i eventually settled for a skintight golden/leopard shirt, a high-waist black/gold skirt, and a silver/snakeskin jacket that was way too small for me. all in all: i looked like jungle girl going disco. my bf picked his outfit from another shop. we knew straight away that it was going to be fun, because the moment we walked in, the sale’s girl went ballistic. - oh my gosh!!! you are the most handsome man i have ever seen! she gushed to my boyfriend. she followed him around, stroking his arms, giggling and picking out stuff for him to try. she had no idea that we were going for something rather tacky (and that we therefore actually kind of liked the stuff she picked), and said “yeeeeeeees!” and “perfect ” to every single shiny garment that he agreed on trying on. in the end he went for a gray, silver sequence suit jacket, a check-patterned hat, a tight t-shirt and some golden jewellery chains. he looked like a complete yuppie and the sale’s girl looked like she was going to pass out on the spot: - oh my gosh! you look so good!! (we laughed so hard we didn’t know what to do!). while he was paying, the sale’s girl turned to me: - is he your boyfriend? -yes. -oh my gosh! you are so lucky! so lucky! i admire you! -he’s indeed very popular in china. -well, he is the most handsome man i have seen! and you…..! you too are very …. (long look at me) special! -special? -yes, in fact. i like the both of you! -that’s nice of you to say. -i love your nose! -my nose? (small moment of hesitation). -it’s the biggest and most beautiful nose i have ever seen! (i had to bite my lip not to have an uncontrolled laugh fit) -ehum, right. eh… thanks! she waved goodbye when we left, opening the door and yelling: - come back soon! you are my favourite laowai couple!!! after us. we were high on laughter as we hit the streets. the party itself was a blast, despite an insane number of strange cancellations from our friends: 2 girls confessed they were preggers and couldn’t make it, one guy confessed his girlfriend was preggers and that he was going to korea to get married (!), one girl had to work, another one thought it was raining too hard outside (…), and then one guy broke his arm in an ice-hockey game the night before?! hahaha! we still managed to pull a crowd, however, and ended up having a great time. people had really made an effort and one guy actually showed up in a dinosaur costume. my boyfriend was a hit in his pimp-outfit, meanwhile my chinese girlfriends expressed their disappointment in me: -jonna, you actually look good in those clothes. i would totally wear that on a night out!! go out as the golden meets silver jungle-disco girl?! (well i shouldn’t say too much –because that’s exactly what i did some drinks later). i guess our taste levels are different! bad taste party calls for bad taste-snacks: we picked these up at our local bakery mmmm, green bean bun anyone?! 
Male: 100%, Female,  just as the snl offshoot , waynes's world , brought out freddie mercury and queen freshly remastered for generation next to make their own, so too does hotel chevalier , the thirteen minute outtake and/or prequel from from wes anderson's new movie , the darjeeling limited , bring us back to 1969 and peter sarstedt 's london megahit of that year, where do you go to my lovely ? with digitized and remastered immediacy peter sarstedt was born in delhi, and spent his infancy in kurseong at the foot of the himalayas, at a tea garden where his father worked, and was therefore a real indian-anglo-indian, obviously more privileged than the folks depicted in bow barracks forever -- since his parents chose to leave for england in 1954, a few years into independence, like other anglo-indians who believed the end of the british empire would bring them harm and left in numbers for australia and canada as well as england through the sixties-- but they really were of indian blood nevertheless. wes anderson must have learned about this while making the darjeeling limited , because it was a hidden factoid in 1969 that would have earned sarstedt wild fans in india, but at the expense of his following in england. it only surfaces now , when india is on a roll and all that doesn't matter so much any more, but is still not seen on his own web site. it's easy to see in these less hairy days that he is indian, and i wonder how acknowledging that will play out. in 1969. of course, i had no idea peter sarstedt was anglo-indian, and would have counted him less hip and more cliff richard if i had. but i was struck then, no doubt like everyone else, by his crisp and easy delivery of the franglais back and forth lyrics, the clarity evident even through the fuzzy recordings of the day. i had no idea who zizi jeanmaire was, nor how to spell her name, nor even for that matter who her husband, the great choreographer roland petit was, but i had heard sacha distel 's cover of raindrops keep falling on my head, did know that karīm al-hussaynī, aga khan iv , was gorgeous as well as being the astonishingly wealthy leader of all shia muslims, that the dowager begum aga khan always wore saris, and last, but by no means least, that it was as cool to wear balmain as to keep your rolling stones records at a swank address, nothing to do with the beatles, much as one might love them. hotel chevalier is famously available for free download at the itunes store , and so represents new and adventurous thinking in movie marketing as well as being a vehicle for reintroducing a worthy megahit of the 60's. as it happens, i went to the first ever, high-octane samma conference this weekend, and nusrat durrani , svp at mtv networks, was one of the stellar presenters at the dinner reception, along with aasif mandvi . after dinner and outstanding performances , during which nusrat durrani showed a pastiche of his clips from the new york marathon set to pink floyd's breathe , i couldn't resist asking him if he had added pink floyd because they had been signed by bhaskar menon . he said no, he just likes them. but it turned out he hadn't heard about peter sarstedt being indian-- so i hope something will come of that, because in these times, it's well to celebrate another desi, in disguise for too long. an excerpt from roland petit's le_jeune_homme_et_la_mort i missed the afternoon per- formance at the national museum of the american indian , but in the evening. i saw the most magnificent production of hula i have ever seen. the san francisco dance company, nā lei hulu i ka wēkiu , delighted a huge audience at damrosch park in lincoln center. i'll mostly let lin cariffe 's pictures of other performances of the same works speak for themselves. kumu patrick makuakāne is such a fabulous presenter as well as a mesmerizing choreographer that he brings the audience right into the show while the show itself plays sensuality, thought and feeling with equal command and force. lihau hannahs and kellen paik provided highly evocative live music for the spectacular production, with thirty-two magnificently costumed dancers, who mixed presentations of traditional legends and tributes with two pieces of piercing satire and several touching, graceful modern pieces, including two set to annie lenox and cyndi lauper's most wistful songs, a brilliant capture of peggy lee's fever , and a somehow heartrending interpretation of tony bennet's version of i left my heart in san franscisco , with its illustrative gestures for "little cable cars" and "halfway to the stars"-- among other phrases -- casually revealing quite exactly what hula is about. a man seated in the row behind me shouted out frantically that he couldn't see, and at least twenty people turned around to shush him, pleading with him not to spoil it for everyone, so swept up was the audience with the gentle but powerful grace and great wit of the show. antonioni's "achingly hip" blow-up fashion shoot veruschka yardbirds jane birkin tennis trailer (vanessa redgrave) obits: bbc new york daily news al jazeera the montreal gazette timesonline indian express telegraph. uk xinhua.net yesterday, after dropping off bear at jfk -- and being totally unaware that the virgin atlantic plane she had boarded was slated to stall on the tarmac for four hours, waiting for that evening's series of short storms to pass, and then take off without most of the food on the menu for passengers on the flight to london--i drove around aimlessly for a while, like anyone deprived of their young might, and decided to check in at the proudly independent art space still known as galapagos . there, the twenty-and-now-early-thirty-somethings still milled and jostled, partying hard without ever lighting a cigarette, because, as director robert elmes has correctly said, "we have our whole lives to live and that is terribly important." the reflecting pool at the entrance is limpid and surprising as ever, but as galapagos has prospered, it will be moving quite soon from williamsburg to dumbo. i considered lillian godchaux's solstice vii, which was going on inside the storied back room, and had been described by lillian herself as "a night of lsd and native american freak-out driven folk and sf-based soary acid folk in hither, wildering, and bewonderment of this great solstice vii of the new water/matter era." but i was curious about avaaz, the act scheduled to appear on the main stage, so i missed almaden , zachary cale and feral cat . instead, i spent the same $7 and one extra $ on two under- priced drinks at the candle-lit bar, especially to watch some of the members of avaaz (not to be confused with avaaz.org ) setting up their fast-rising electroglobaldiscotek . t aking in their sleek looks, i wondered if they all had gone to mit and now have day jobs at investment banks-- not that there's anything wrong with that. the best version of sea had just opened down the street when i first saw galapagos . i had gone to n sixth street back then entirely because dave eggers and mcsweeney's held their first and earliest new york events in the now fabled back room, while they were reinventing fiction and food , hilarity and social awareness all at the same time. they turned writing into performance art as well -- right there at galapagos, where i recall a gentleman in his nineties telling a tale of death and playground slides to the sound of helpless yet respectfully muffled laughter-- and n ow they need our help getting past their distributor publisher's group west's bankruptcy, by reason of which they are suddenly out $130k in one fell swoop. say it isn't so... they are making a valiant effort with their online sales of all manner of items mcsweeney and also with their "heartbreaking ebay auction of staggering audacity "... i pondered this tale of swinging through the ages by a length of tooth floss, and drank two drinks one after another as images of something like starlight played on the blue velvet curtains. these were soon drawn back for the laser light show streamed through whirling stencils in many-colored beams by dimmsummer , and young pat miscellane ous , bare-chested in chinos and a full dress, full length cheyenne headpiece started rapping through the hai-chai remix that dj boo (aka juggaknots) and i believe bollygirl dk also had started up together. this was with and sometimes without a duet from--? samera? reena?. then came dj impala's entr'acte, and she played september , billie jean , kiss , and just a few minutes of the long version of marvin gaye's gotta give it up , but stopped while people had just started moving to this party-song-to-end-all-party-songs, to move on to patti labelle's original version of lady marmalade . how long ago it seems and yet not so far away at all. mean while, silhouettes danced on the once again starlit velvet curtains, and cellphones flashed as taking pictures became general. then came all-desi recently schooled bamboo shoots , who are a really good, very special band that somehow brings the lead, rhythm and bass guitar plus drums format into the present moment. they were reviewed on sepia mutiny and played on conan . strangely, it was the cold war era movie playing on the screen behind them that distracted, and because i'm not of the three screen generation, i spent at least fifteen minutes growing older trying to figure out who was who in black and white in juliet of the spirits . and then i had to go home while the band played on... and go to sleep, missing butterthief and suspicious brown... the movie's called evening , and if there's only one film that people who think too much and feel quite a lot and like to be slightly but deeply scared should see this summer, this is it. al invited me to the walter reade theater preview, where susan minot and michael cunningham showed up after the screening to discuss their experience in co-writing the screenplay adapted from the book with kent jones, the man with a light touch from the film society of lincoln center . throughout the screening, i wondered about the marvelous filter effects on the dream sequences-- how they came on so wonderfully strong and obvious, then tapered off so gradually through the course of the story. were they in the lens or a part of the editing? faces were so closely imaged at the start of the story, and with so much particularity, that their natural asymmetry led the eye beyond conven- tional judgments about beauty, although every actor was stunning by any measure. one had to look afresh at already famous faces, that then grew familiar very quickly in these new forms. the casting is as superb as the cast. of course, but of course, glenn close was meryl streep's mother in another life! speaking of measurements, vanessa redgrave's acting must be measured by the frame, not by seconds. that's how close up the view becomes in this unsentimental yet touching study of two deaths in played out counterpoint. while redgrave certainly carries it, all the others absolutely rise to the occasion. having seen and heard my own grandmother apparently having good time at a fair number of parties on her near-deathbed, i found that this tale resonated with me, and the telling of it, its production, seemed to create a convincing experience of the swing between over- whelming wooziness and diamond hard clarity in the course of that personal time travel and that wandering out of body that heralds a slow death. drawing away, the big picture of the society that provides the setting for this surprising story is delivered au point as well. while the circumstances of the wealthy family seems casually depicted, there is an uncanny conveyance of how things are proportioned for the rich. the wedding is generously informal and correct, not ostentatious, and the bride's dress is not overly grand. this is how it has to be, in a summer setting among people who enjoy extreme cleanliness, rely on slightly stodgy design, established standards of comfort, consuming both hand made and manu- factured goods of quality, and who take proper care of inherited objects as a matter of course. yet there is also a clear sense of the perilous crowding and living cheek by jowl that imprisons the rich or aristocratic or patrician. their circles must always be suffocatingly small, the more so the richer or better-established they are, and marriage and even preferred forms of adultery must occur within that small closed circle. the comedy of homosexuality in these narrow straits raises its suggestive head several times in the film. sometimes it happens mistakenly, as when the mother of the bride happens upon her daughter sharing her wedding morning jitters with her college friend and bridesmaid who has crept under the covers. pshaw! sometimes it arises unawares, but for real, as when that same bride's mother snatches away her son from his partner during a playful jitterbug for a masterfully bone-chilling rhumba, purposefully extinguishing any possibility of his attachment to another woman. ouch! these people are not incorrectly depicted as being stifled or inhibited, though. there is nothing in recent film to compare with glen close's raw howl over buddy's sudden young death. there is faerie magic in the woods, but also there are different ways of seeing and treating a small cliff or those same woods, either as the border area between manicured grounds and vast, unknown, dangerous nature, or simply as perfectly familiar bits of the family's property. playing off the difference in perspectives in a practical joke provides a bit of class-conflict that erupts into rage. alcohol always plays a leading role in susan minot's books. in making buddy a far more central figure in the film than he is in the book, michael cunningham ties this story closer to the rest of susan minot's work. the two writers, live four blocks apart in nyc but quite naturally met at a wedding in nairobi soon after sm had recovered the rights to her book after an earlier attempt to turn it into a movie. despite their close collaboration (sm said the collaborative process with mc had been like a master class in screenwriting), they differed on several points. for instance, mc believes a book is always a work in progress, the print capturing only a moment in the process, whereas sm says a printed volume in your hand is a clear indication of completion and enables the writer to let it go. mc said that film cannot capture an inner life as well a a book, but sm pointed out that one's inner life occurs in images, not words. but then, they spoke of shared delights in the making of the film, like watching meryl streep and vanessa redgrave on a monitor outside the house, and being amazed to see them step into character and switch it on,, discarding their natural selves in a flash. they talked about filming at a newport house of that genre known as a "cottage" that belongs to the cushing family, rather than in maine, as in the book, which would have proven overwhelmingly expensive to produce. they concurred on the problem of turning an entire book into a movie, where films are really short stories, and the more sympathetic form for adapting a novel into image format is a television series. mc spoke fondly of squabbling with cinematographer and director lajos koltai over lines about which he had second thoughts, but that koltai wanted to keep. sm spoke about about eileen atkins having trouble with the cadence of the lines until sm explained that the nurse was irish. they both spoke of hugh dancy's out of period long hair, and that lajos koltai had predicted that critics would be all about his hair. we shall see. i was walking down 82nd street day before yesteday, late in the afternoon, and realized that i had missed this year's kips bay show house , which was being dismantled. volunteering there had been one of my favorite "rites" of spring for longer than i care to admit, but it's been more than seven years since i turned my attention to another event that raises funds for the kips bay boys and girls club. the show house i missed was hosted by the brilliant janna bullock and rigroup . this was a very different undertaking from what it once was, when i was one of a band of perhaps twenty young women who took turns watching the rooms under the auspices of the original show house committee. the committee never changed from year to year, but were always there from dawn till dusk, in chanel suits and ropes of pearls, fresh as proverbial daisies, and well into their seventies-- or so it seemed to me. the air was always scented with rigaud candles and flowers, which competed with paint and varnish that was not yet cured. there were fads for peonies one year, orchids the next, and air plants another. one had to know what the antiques and paint finishes were, to explain them to visitors, and and make sure nobody fainted from climbing the stairs, as all the terrible things that can happen on elevators weren't covered in the insurance contracts. once, mrs. mazzola decided to climb to the top and work her way down, and had to sit down at the top floor landing, which called for procedures reserved for extreme emergencies, in terms of the arrangements of those days. luckily, a chinese garden stool came in handy until a proper chair could be brought. climbing the beautiful staircases two and three steps at a time was a special treat for me, and the main reason i always went back. i was new to new york, and missed staircases, especially those massive marble ones with low risers in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century houses of my hometown, calcutta , on which one could jump about and play games. between chasing up and down these newer but equally generous staircases, i enjoyed the fact that the visitors were colorful, international, dressed up, and wore great shoes. my first happy moment of extra responsibility came one year in the first and grandest house, which was on 66th street and belonged at the time to imelda marcos, who lent it every year for the show house. in the main drawing room situated on the second floor, as in a piano nobile, robert metzger had set up an early multi-channel music system around the edges of the room which featured a lush, over-the-top eighties version of period decor, with plenty of silk damask and passementerie, the console being cleverly tucked away, iirc, in cabinet with boulle marquetry or similar. i was required to stand by a massive flower arrangement on a round table in the center of the room under a magnificent russian chandelier, smile at visitors and explain the rug, and i noticed that both speakers deployed to the west were playing the same channel, as were the ones to the east. to my enormous delight, rm allowed me to pull out the console after the house closed for the day, fiddle with the wiring and fix it. that would never be done today, as the firms who do the sound would, first of all, never make that kind of mistake, and the house would certainly never allow a volunteer to touch the wiring. a few years later, at the first show house at 603 park, also the last chaired by the legendary rella macdougall , i got to be her right hand gal at the entrance, where she handled tickets herself every day, transforming that job into a subtle performance that required her great wit. that year, the pantry, with its green-shaded light, big silver safe and humongous ancient icebox, was just cleaned up, because the idea was still only to present a decorated house, and the pantry was a perfect relic. one day, during that run, mrs. macdougall was hurrying to the show house when a bag lady. as we called them then, stopped her to ask for help. rella, being as warm-hearted as she was elegant, asked what she could do for her. the bag lady said, "could you hold up this mirror for me?"and while rella did that, the bag lady rummaged about her shopping bag, drew out and carefully put on a set of big false lashes. the house at 603 park is one room deep but quite wide, with a long, long park avenue facade, and commensurate taxes, so it stayed on the market for a long time, to become the default show house for kips bay and other causes for some years. thierry dèspont created a memorable decor in the paneled room there, but i can't remember whether it was for kips bay or the american hospital in paris. although pictures of rooms from recent years are available online now, rooms that came before live only in one's memories and in the old journals-- a stack of which were lost to me in a heist upstate, in which i lost about a thousand books as well. what remains in my head: mark hampton's cream, white and sisal drawing room on 66th street, with the bureau plat placed like a sofa table, in which all the fine georgian mahogany became beautifully abstracted; the grand yet hilarious dining room that ruben de saavedra created at 62nd street, where the fabric hung walls were drawn aside at mirrored intervals, for busts of laughing moors to peek out; richard ridge's almost completely lavender bedroom, which a band of his friends left in a group, all crying out, "nurse!"; the narrow room at 1 east 94th street that j. allen murphy dressed in yellow and benarasi gold brocade, including an unraveled paghri as a pelmet, hung with mughal lanterns, which he dedicated to the raj mata of jaipur. she came to look, and i was embarrassed to see her at doubles while i was still wearing a dress from volunteering (so un-indian and deeply frowned upon then, though pants were fine); richard ridge's dining room in which the romney had been cleaned to within a micron of its life; the large bedroom that john saladino turned into a frescoed bathroom with a brass punkhah, so insulted was he not to have gotten a drawing room, according to my friend who used to work for him. recent memorable rooms include odile de schietere's venetian drawing room with furniture from ferrières , michael simon's dix-huitième in black, the cleanest stable in creation by andrew tedesco , larry laslo's black bedroom where the black baccarat chandelier made its new york début,... diantha nype was another reason i was there. diantha had left bryn mawr to get married, which is like leaving hogwarts to become a muggle, but then she out-mawr-ed everybody by inventing the show house-- it really was her idea to start with, although this will remain forever unsung, because it's totally not the credo to claim this kind of credit, considering how many other people have worked long and hard to make it happen. nevertheless, start it she did, and so all show houses that exist, sprouting across the nation every spring and fall -- to diantha we owe this most excellent concept. of all the original committee, it was she who was always second in command to rella, she who addressed the robbery and she who created the public image of the show house, as it is, was and ever shall be. anyway, having missed the new show house, and missing the brio of the old days, it was a very happy touch of deja vue to see what matthew sudock of m design has done at david burke & donatella , where i met c for lunch. the mix of hicks in carpet and screens, with creamy walls, plain mirrors, backlit red dry arrangement, large and loopy chandeliers, cheery cherry leather seating and gigantic bouquets of red-and white striped trumpet lilies , all scaled for a nice tall new york brownstone, reminded me of the panache, the hint of improv and inventive flair of the old days. the food is great , and playful too, and the tuna and salmon tartare not to be missed english-speaking people who are deaf to aspirates and aspirated consonants in indian languages can't say ghee , and tend to produce incorrect spellings like ghandi and dehli. because of this speech impediment, the word sipahi , meaning soldier in persian and urdu, became sepoy for the british, who gave this misheard word currency by giving the indian uprising of 1857 against themselves a misleading nickname --the sepoy mutiny. the uprising involved not only huge numbers of mercenary indian soldiers under british pay and command, but also indian princes, their subjects of various classes, their armies and camp followers, the peasantry of those parts of the gangetic plain then under direct british control , tribal peoples of the himalayan foothills and northern plains and motley others. by simplifying the facts, the spin machine of the british empire was able to promote the idea nearly unimpeded for well over a hundred years that it was all a matter of animal grease (beef and pork tallow) needed to insert rounds into enfield rifles. how this single matter was supposed to have offended both hindus and muslims so much as to give rise to the events of a whole year, in which indian soldiers and civilians massacred british men, women and children, burned down their dwellings and destroyed key installations of the colonial administration is quite a mystery. apparently, at that time in england, a popular supple- mentary explanation for the uprising was that everybody in india was completely enraged at having to learn to behave themselves under the wonders of british rule-- much the way we are told today that 9/11 happened because an unspecified "they" were "jealous of our freedoms." (e.g., see how it seemed to the metcalfe family ) william dalrymple is the first british historian to use material in translation from numerous sources written in persian and urdu , and among the first to use the palace and city records now stored in the national archives, as a writer of popular histories, he has a tough row to hoe in terms of publicizing his perceptions and findings, novel and dangerous to some and not radically different enough for others. still signing away on his book tour , i suppose, he is more inclined to discuss the hard causes of the uprising during interviews than in this book. with respect to softer causes, like evangelism, which he positions centrally, he doesn't indulge in overkill to make a point, but sometimes confuses anger with fear and takes at face value what he could examine a bit more critically. animal grease and surging evangelism were no doubt the last straw, but only because the orders to use them could not have been perceived as a simple misunderstanding after a century of many kinds of deliberate and outrageous british assaults on indian culture, property, laws and human rights. about this, a variety of indian and foreign-born people had already reached consensus many times , sometimes long before 1857. those harsher provocations are not discussed in the last mughal , which focuses on events in delhi, which was at that time still a grand and antique city in a state of preservation , home to an exquisite culture. one hopes wd is saving the tougher subject matter of how to assign responsibility for the background of the cataclysmic events of 1857 for another book. as it is, he has already told the hindu that this book has made him more friends in india than in england. kashmiri gate in 1880 the book is cause for celebration. the thinking is sensitive, the language is fluid and rich. it conveys the excitement of breaking new ground, and the pictures and line drawings at the start of each chapter are delightful. the two new maps parading as old ones, in which metcalfe house seems to dwarf the imperial palace , hindus seem to live east of the ganges and 1857 looks like the 16th century, are very silly, but one can't let that get in the way. the british sources tend towards diaries and letters, and produce an up-close-and-personal effect, while the persian and urdu source material is more often drawn from professional writing of various kinds, so it generates a more public voice and panoramic view. going back and forth between the two sides of the narrative, i felt as if i was walking up and down a seesaw, faster and faster, back and forth, until the final british-led bloodbath led onto the slow, grim comedy of the denouement. as a child, i always wondered about the the strange reek inside the mughal tombs of delhi, something like ancient bird droppings, which was missing at the taj mahal. i'd been told that these crumbly, dark and elegant monuments belonged to the 16th and 17th khooni darwaza, where three senior princes were stripped, shot and their bodies robbed of jewelry by major william hodson centuries, and never thought about that again. now, this book has brought home to me how recent was their ruin , how active the scent of death and decay that hangs about them still, that many of them were family mausoleums, and that my great-grandfathers had already been born before a long, gruesome seige and a grisly genocide was carried out in those environs in broad daylight. i remember the vultures were still all over delhi more than a century later. wd's recent article in the guardian explores similarities between british thinking in 1857 and widespread present perceptions in the west about the iraq war. from some perspectives, the similarities are obvious and striking; from others, the similarities are not fully admissible. it is certainly alarming to find that the mainstream press has reactivated the very same language last used by the british in 1857 to describe the uprising--- to describe the iraq war today . it is disheartening to see that in the post-colonial world, complications and spiraling violence can still be as easily provoked and fed upon by occupying forces playing on internecine rivalries. it is unpleasant to remember that the bush administration claimed to have received their intelligence about wmd from british sources . it is strange to see queen elizabeth, who last visited washington to bestow an award on george bush sr. for planning and executing the first gulf war, now returning to reinforce the military alliance . meanwhile, tony blair, who should probably, given the current scheme of things, be tried by a kangaroo court and hung up to dry, is being sent off on an international farewell tour instead. one must wonder, are her private assets not yet suitably diversified? kashmiri gate i appreciate and enjoy the last mughal for the depth and decency and richness of its narrative, and will read it many times, but i don't see the point of setting out a new and elaborate defense to counter the british allegations of 150 years ago. the british position, developed to justify deposing the monarch, was that bahadur shah zafar was singularly responsible for fomenting a pan-islamic rebellion against the british stretching from west asia across india. although saddam husein might not have been plotting anything like that either, to draw any similarities by implication and suggestion is to stretch facts to fit the polemic. the question that goes unanswered is, did the british deserve it then, and have we and anyone else done anything to deserve it now? there is no question that the movements of 1857 included muslim jihadis, as did others that came before in the multitude of violent eruptions that represented efforts to rid the subcontinent of the british occupation. surely the more important point is that these populist, pan-indian movements brought about consensus across religious and cultural lines about british wrongdoing, and eventually gave birth to cooperative, sustained resistance, rather than belonging to or advocating for any religion. today's popular resistances in west asia carry forward a different set of historical grievances and cultural motifs, although they may one day coalesce and draw a motley set of movements together so that even sunni and shia will come to terms . wd either avoids or misses a key opportunity to emphasize the crossover nature of the uprising: when the sipahis call zafar "prithviraj," wd offers a literal translation, i.e., ruler of the world. if this had been their intention, the sipahis might have called him shah jehan iv. zafar was more rajput than timurid by blood, though he was also considered a sufi pir, so the the sepahis were more likely referring to the heroic and legendary 12th century rajput emperor, prithviraj chauhan iii , the last hindu monarch to be seated at delhi. but of course, at 82 years of age, though he might be the rightful emperor, zafar could be no prithviraj. wd suggests that if zafar had led the charge to defend delhi while the defense was on an upswing, he might have reversed the course of history. but at that point in the book, wd has already established that the aged cultural and spiritual leader was far too physically feeble to do anything of the kind. except the occasional nut job, most european monarchs were by then pretty far distanced from being military leaders, and e

Male: 100%, Male,  don't call it a comeback : surprisingly enough i actually had a pretty good day today. i managed to stop by school and get some work done and i got to hang out with a lot of people (read: girls ) i haven't seen in ages. i plan on doing the same tomorrow and friday in an attempt to finally get cracking on the thesis, which has been bringing me down for ages. after dinner and having worked on my movable type site, which i'm hoping will be ready this weekend (plus a couple of blog entries i've been working on), i wen't down the pub to see the arsenal - roma game. honestly, i had decided not to get my hopes up, because of last five games arsenal has played and their reputation for not being strong in away games in europe. and it was my impression that oleg "the ox" luzhny was out with an injury leaving a spot open in defense for some german kid. so when roma scored within four minutes that didn't exactly help with my confidence, either. but thierry henry showed everyone why he makes the big bucks and scored on literally every shot he had on goal to make it an incredible 3-1 win. i watched the game with my brother , who's a real arsenal fan, and a bunch of roma supporters, so the win was extra sweet. it was difficult not to gloat, but seeing as the ref wasn't exactly friendly towards the italian side we tried to keep namecalling and insults to a minimum. i was watching csi last night. i have this thing about watching television series from the beginning and for some reason i can't start watching a series from episode three or five. so when csi was first show here and i didn't have the channel at first, i just gave up on it. but seeing as it has just started from episode one again on a channel i have now i've started watching it and already after two episodes i'm pretty hooked. it's very different from other shows and i like the cast a lot more than i thought i would. so now that all the other shows i follow will probably take a long christmas vacation it's nice to know that there'll still be at least one cool show on. the other show that i follow religiously right now is the west wing . we' re about a season behind the american schedule, so they've just introduced mary-louise parker here. i'd forgotten how cute she is. i saw her recently in the mushy, but watchable cupid & cate where she wears a lot of black eye make-up, and she looks just as fantastic on the west wing . and everything that i've liked about the show so far is still just as good or better in this third season, so i'm still totally hooked. send lawyers, guns and money. the shit has hit the fan : i feel like my head is about to explode. i've just had the worst weekend in ages and it's spilling heavily over into this week. i've been getting letters about my taxes and other depressing money situations and although a week ago i was sure that all this was way behind me everything has just been opened up again and now it's even worse than originally expected. since saturday morning i've felt like picking up a louisville slugger and beating the shit out of somebody, but i don't have a baseball bat, so i've been forced to sit around and curse, mumble incoherently, and bitch, which i've been doing. a lot. it's really frustrating to be completely powerless and just seeing everything fall apart like a fucking house of cards. so i haven't really been in the mood to blog about my excellent trip to copenhagen and the fantastic concerts i went to. but as soon as i get my hands on some prozac i'll be on it like the paparazzi on j-lo's ass. the only good news right now is that i've been reading we blog and this humble weblog is mentioned in it. kinda. if you look on page 13 and 14 there are screen dumps illustrating how you set up a blogger account. and if you look on the left side you'll notice that under blogs of note it says: there is nothing to not be amazed at . so it seems that my 15 minutes have stretched on to a link to my site accidentally being visable in a book. how very exciting! don't be real, be postmodern : nothing much going on here right now. in about an hour i'll be on my way for a three day stay in copenhagen. i'll go see ryan adams and jesse malin tonight and coldplay and idlewild tomorrow, both of which i'm really looking forward to. i've been listening to idlewild all day and they're actually really good, so it should be awesome to see them live. also tomorrow denmark are playing poland tonight and the news story is that morten olsen, the head coach, would like to see our wings score some goals. turns out ebbe sand (of schalke 04) and jon dahl tomasson (of ac milan) has scored something like 75% of the danish goals, so now that martin jørgensen has started scoring in udinese and dennis rommedahl has scored for psv eindhoven he like to see them do the same for the national squad. well, wouldn't we all? i finished fixing the headers on my moveable type template last night. i had to open 176 individual postings and add a new header and delete the old, which is about as tedious as it gets. but now it's done, so hopefully i'll be able to fix the rest of the problems this week and launch the new version next week. chances are it'll look almost exactly like the current site, but hopefully it'll load a lot faster. i'm pretty nuts about bands, who make 80s inspired music and wear 80s inspired clothes. the latest to blow me away is swedish band melody club . their single palace station is the best retro single since emerge by fischerspooner , so you should definitely check it out. i was dressed for success, but success it never comes : i’ve been a little busy lately, so i haven’t gotten around to talking about the supergrass show i went to last week. it wasn’t as good as the first time i saw them, but the last half hour of the show was pretty great. if you haven’t seen supergrass live they basically consist of dr. zaius, paul mccartney's younger brother and that chubby kid you were best friends with in the 3rd grade. and yet somehow they’ve managed to put together some really cool songs for their four albums. unfortunately, they played way too many songs from their latest album, so it wasn’t until towards the end, when they pulled out all the stompers the show really took off. during one of the better songs early on in the set some preppy 18-year-old twat in a black turtleneck decided to stagedive. for my money nothing is more rewarding than watching some guy stagedive only to have the crowd part before him like the red sea. but unfortunately that didn’t prevent him for jumping out from the stage three more times. diving is sooo ten years ago, dude! i mean the 70s had moshing, the 80s had moonwalking and the safety dance, and the 90s had diving. now, how about we try something new like not acting like muppets in public and actually listen to the damn music? how does that sound? but even so it was an entertaining night out except for the opening act, the 22-20s, who looked like the strokes , but sounded like an inept jon spencer cover band and played excruciatingly loud. they are definitely to be avoided in the future. i’ve been listening to ben folds live and slanted & enchanted this weekend and they’re pretty great. obviously, they’re very different albums, but both cool in their own way. the ben folds album has some really interesting versions of old favourites and there are a couple of songs, where the audience participation really lifts the songs up to another level. slanted is one of those albums, where during the first listen you wonder how the hell this record ever got released, but after a few spins you start getting it. i’ve only been listening to the first cd, because those 24 songs are a lot to digest in themselves, so it’ll be a while before i want to listen to the live stuff. the weirdest thing i’ve seen today is an article claiming that the fbi has been investigating bobby fischer, because they thought his mum was a commie spy. and to make the story even weirder the famous recluse has apparently been giving radio interviews lately praising the 9/11 attacks and made anti-semitic comments. i guess ben kingsley won’t spend any more time searching for bobby fischer . we're in it for the money : supergrass is playing here tonight, so naturally we’re going. i saw them the last time they played here as well and it was awesome. i’ve been listening to the new album quite a bit lately and although it’s not as good as their first two records there still are some choice cuts on there. the song seen the light was used in a phone commercial here, but the commercial came out a good month before the record came out, so it was a discussion point down the pub for a while if it actually were supergrass or just someone, who sounded like them playing. the song is good though and so are tracks like rush hour soul and can’t get up . however, i do think grace is an odd choice for a single. according to this nme review the guys haven’t lost it, so it’ll probably be a crackin’ show tonight. i saw an interview with british pop act sugababes the other day and it went something like this: interviewer : that was “you know you’re right”, the latest video by nirvana. you guys like nirvana? keisha sugababe : i only know that one song… interviewer : smells like teen spirit? keisha sugababe : how does that one go? interviewer : dah-da-da da da dum dah-da-da da da... keisha sugababe : yeah, that’s the one! nice to see the most important album of my generation still has an impact on the kids. i’m guessing she wasn’t the one, who came up with the idea to blend are friends electric ? with adina howards’ freak like me . i’ve been playing tony hawk 3 lately and although i think it is fun i can sense that i won’t be playing much longer. i suck at it and if i don’t achieve a medal in level 3 i won’t be able to open up the rest of the levels, which means i’ll be stuck playing the same three levels for the rest of my life. isn’t that like dante’s seventh ring of hell? i ordered some stuff from amazon this week and it’s already been shipped, which is so cool. i’ve decided to get back to work on my thesis, so i ordered we blog: publishing online with weblogs , which hopefully will have some insights that’ll motivate me to start writing again. i ordered ben folds live , because i’ve always been a huge ben folds five fan and on this cd ben plays both solo and bf5 songs mixed with b-sides, covers, and tracks i haven’t even heard before. and to make it even cooler there’s a dvd with seven live tracks and live antics (whatever that is). i can’t wait to get that one. i have every pavement album except slanted & enchanted , so when i found out a special slanted & enchanted remastered double cd had been released with live tracks, peel sessions, ep tracks, and more i had to get it right away. and finally i ordered the photo album by death cab for cutie, because i only have we have the facts… and i’ve been curious about there other albums for a while. i was working on my new moveable type blog yesterday, and it didn't exactly go according to plan. first off i have no idea how to make the text look like i want it and secondly my headers got messed up, when i transferred the files from blogger . for some reason mt has taken the first 30-40 characters of each posting and copied them into the title box. that means i now have to go through every single posting and edit the title and remove the original title from the main text box. that'll give me somehting to do friday night. that's what i like about you : i mentioned bill maher's book when you ride alone you ride with bin laden yesterday and it got me thinking about a poster we used to have on the door to the dj booth at the internet radio station i used to work for. the poster read "when you pirate mp3s, you're downloading communism", which we thought was pretty funny. maher's book has a lot of "patriotic posters" inspired by posters made during world war ii, but updated so they fit the into the post 9/11 scheme of things. if you want to find out more about the book he even has a special ride alone website. the downloading communism poster is made by the people at modern humorist (who are also the geniuses behind this t-shirt ). i went over there today to find a link to the poster and came across their fall 2002 tv preview . this might only be fun if you watch as much television as i do, but even so i've picked out a couple of fun comments: presidio med (cbs): this medical drama revolves around a team of dedicated physicians that treats the patient, not the problem. unlike "er." remember that time on "er" when dr. carter left a five-year-old victim of a drunk driving accident on the operating table to catch the last quarter of a bulls game? that shit will not fly at the presidio. still standing (cbs): jami gertz, better than she ever did. looking like a true survivor. feeling like a little kid. push, nevada (abc): shot in the real-time format pioneered by fox’s "24," this new drama series covers the 22-hour delivery of exotic dancer nevada stevenson’s first child. seeing as push, nevada has already been cancelled maybe the world just isn't ready for a show about an irs agent even if it's written by ben affleck. maybe you've noticed that at times this site loads slower than a clem snide song and the comments are usually unreliable to say the least (and there's has been plenty of behind-the-scenes problems as well). so for a while i've been contemplating changing to moveable type . i've already moved the template over and as soon as i get the last bugs sorted out i'll probably make the switch completely. but until i figure out how to make my old headers like decent in the new mt setting you'll have to be patient with me. no sissies get your love : a lot has happened this week, so i’ll just mention a couple of highlights. i spent three days in copenhagen hanging out and going to concerts. i saw doves at loppen and it was a very good show. they played about 75 minutes on a stage, which was about foot high, which meant the audience stood very close to the band. i was standing about 6 feet away from singer jimi goodwin, which meant i could look him straight in the eyes when he was singing, which was a bit weird. but they played a cool set with tracks from both lost souls and the last broadcast and ended with a track called space bass , which sounded like a sub sub track, but i think it might just be a new doves track. either way it was a kicking way to end the show. the next day i saw hawksley workman at rust and that was simply amazing. he played a long show accompanied by a piano player called mr. lonely . there weren’t a lot of people at the concert, but it seemed like most of them were diehard fans ( tinka was there, but i didn’t see her). he told weird stories and sang his weird songs and it was just incredible. my favourites were no sissies and sad house daddy of the for him & the girls album and it was especially cool to hear the crowd take over vocal duties on the latter. he has the most remarkable vocal range going from theatrical bertolt brecht-like singing to jeff buckley-like falsetto, so it was actually quite funny hearing the fans trying to sing along with mixed success. hawksley looks remarkable like casey affleck , but the scarf, earrings and sleeveless t-shirt made it easier to tell them apart. besides going to concerts and hooking up with friends in copenhagen i played fifa 2003 , which is unbelievably cool and i saw 61- , which i also quite liked. the movie is about the season where mickey mantle and roger maris both tried to break babe ruth's homerun record. but it's actually a lot more about the two players as people and not so much about baseball. and i got to listen to the new badly drawn boy album, which sounds mighty promising. i saw a fun episode of leno recently with bill maher and marilyn manson (maher was plugging his book and manson his dvd ). i like manson and i think he’s pretty funny, but the best bit was maher going over the reason why george w. bush wants to invade iraq: [mentions several bizarre reasons to invade iraq] maher: he (saddam hussein) tried to kill my dad. this time it’s personal! maher: and he gassed his own people. leno: well, didn’t he? maher: well yeah. in the 80s! talk about your late reply. i mean are we looking into why wham! broke up? right now i’m listening to the ravens / bengals game through nfl.com and it’s pretty exciting. for some reason the ravens organisation doesn’t broadcast a signal from the games, so every week i’m listening to the opponent’s commentary and except for one guy these commentators are remarkable fair. obviously, they support their own team, but they always give credit where credit is due and generally describe the games fairly. except for one guy. every time the ravens play against the pittsburgh steelers a guy called myron cope makes me what to fly to pittsburgh and open up a can of whup-ass. he has the most annoying screechy old-man’s voice ever and he gets so excited during the game that he stutters uncontrollably. he is completely unfair against the opposing team and last the ravens played the steelers he began making up words, so even his co-commentators had no idea what the hell he was talking about. you know how john turturro has a face for radio in the quiz show ? well, this guy has a voice for newspapers. he’s the main reason i hate the steelers, because every time we played them i have to listen to that old fool talk nonsense for three hours. if you think i’m exaggerating try going through this treasure chest of babble (this is my “ favourite ”). and finally i got to meet someone this weekend, who i’ve been emailing with for ages. it’s always a bit strange meeting someone you know through emails face-to-face for the first time, but i thought this encounter was remarkably uncomfortable. when it's time to party we will party hard : i'm on my way to copenhagen, but i just thought i'd post something before i left. i was out saturday night and for some reason i decided to write about it when i got home. obviously, i'd had a few drinks, so it's probably for the best i didn't publish it right away. but i thought i'd edit it a bit and post it anyways. so here goes: so, last night was alright. well, the drinking, talking, eating bit was fun. the dancing, clubbing, trying to get shagged bit was somewhat of a bust. and the reason is this: there is no good party music! grease mega mix? the house version of proud mary? boney m? all this is the kind of music i imagine is played in the elevators on the way to hell. and this is what i have to endure on a night out on the town. to be fair they did sneak in a prince and a depeche mode song, but in the course of four hours that is just not enough. i realize they can't play stuff like dry the rain or cut your hair, but there has to be some sort of middle road. and to make matters weirder i wouldn't even have gotten in hadn't i gone to school with the doorman (i didn't bring my id card and the age limit is all of 23). but to be fair it was still a decent enough night. sure, i did spend most of the night standing in a corner with my arms wrapped around me like i was representing the east coast, but at least i did get to meet a couple of charming members of the fairer sex and i got to hang out with friends i don't see that often. i guess i was a bit grumpy that night, but that's the way i get when i have to listen to shitty music. we ate at a cool restaurant where they had a lounge with bean bag chairs and a dj, who played stuff like koop's summer son. so going from that to destiny's child just brings me down, man.

Female: 100%, Female, well many of you know the battle that is waged in the gotch household almost every day . . . jen vs. andrew in the battle of soup (dah dah dah daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah). it has been a losing battle on my end for about 4 years running. you know how he has his list of foods he hates (wet meat, pulpy juice, cherries, pickles, and on and on)? well soup always seems to find it's way to the top of the list. this is a problem for me, since i am a soup lover. i love to eat soup, i love to make soup and when i feel that first bit of cold in the autumn air (which in l.a. means when it drops below 70 degrees), i want soup. and yesterday, for some odd reason, he agreed to a pot of soup. i think it is mostly because i told him it had peanut butter in it, and peanut butter is at the top of his "foods i love" list right after hamburgers. so after a short trip to the market, some chopping of vegetables, and warming of bread, soup was served. and it was good, real, real good. andrew ate every last drop, only quizzing me a few times about the ingredients. i was reluctant to tell him there was salsa in it, because he doesn't like cooked tomatoes or tomato soup. it didn't seem to phase him. he even ate the garbanzo beans, and he hates beans, except green beans. later that night, when the truth was rising to the surface, he confided in me that next time, he could do without the beans. i reminded him that he loves humus, but that was not enough. "it's a texture thing, not a taste thing" he calmly replied. either way, i feel like some progress was made here last night. there is even talk of more soup next week. i'll keep you posted. here's the recipe if you are interested.
Female: 100%, Female, i have some photos i've been meaning to post from david reid who went to lola a few months ago. i've post them all over the next few weeks!this is makali, a bonobo rescued from a biomedical centre. he has somethign to say! noki and her baby are in wonderful health! they've been released into the enclosures. noki is nursing her baby well and protecting her from slapping branches and the sun. but she is also very proud and loves to show the baby to the other bonobos! ooo - i got this photo from val when noki just arrived at lola. val is a volunteer at lola - and has been for 15 years. she works practically full time handling lola's accounts - the sanctuary wouldn't run without her. she comes in to lola almost every day, for no recognition or reward other than helping the bonobos. we love you val! and look at little noki and those huge black eyes.and then here is val helping noki give birth - 10 years later!we share so much with these bonobos, they become so much a part of our lives. val has been sending photos like crazy - she is a very proud grandmother. ok back to lola now and i'm a little behind on all the news - but noki had a baby!! noki is one of the cat burglers at lola - she is also a prolific tool user - which bonobos haven't been seen to do in the wild, fyi. once she used a long stick to steal my camera bag. noki is also one of the smartest bonobos in all the experiments we do - she is so wildly interested in all the tests and sometimes we have trouble getting her out of the testing room! now she has a baby!! fanny the vet was there for the whole thing, and so was valerie, who was there when noki was first rescued...
Female: 100%, Female,  this week's tag was captured by john. unlike some tags, there's little debate over what the tag is trying to convey - peace for all! lovely sentiments! last week it really felt as if spring had arrived - even the sidewalks were shouting out that spring had sprung! well, as anyone who has lived in this area for any amount of time knows, it is waaaaay too early to pack up those coats, hats and gloves. fortunately, at least according to the accuweather forecast, after today, things will start improving again and the forecast is for fair skies and pleasant temperatures for the rest of the week. that's a good thing since wednesday is st. patrick's day - although it's not an official holiday, in lakewood it does appears to be a day when many people take the day off - perhaps as a "mental health day." the light grows stronger in march, perhaps it is the light which inspires the caretaker to spring clean. the garden is being prepared - the tall dried grass has been cut, the ground is bare and awaits for the evolution of spring. a squirrel has come to help the gardener and finds a wayward acorn. to see all the snaps of the second sunday statue series go here . yesterday while i was wandering about i met little jenny (mixed breed puppy) and her new family. it was jenny's first day with her new family. in addition to coming into a loving human family, jenny will benefit from being adopted into a family with a wise and older dog jack (seen above). as i was leaving jenny and her family, more neighbors came up to welcome jenny into the hood - this time a big, friendly dog and two of his humans. today's skywatch friday photos were taken in the birdtown district of lakewood. birdtown is lakewood's oldest neighborhood and is home to many beautiful churches, most of the churches were founded by various immigrant groups who settled in lakewood to work in the factories which dominated the birdtown district. the three churches pictured today are all located on quail street and include st. gregory the theologian and northcoast baptist church (above) and st. nicholas ukrainian orthodox pro-cathedral (right). to read more about the history of birdtown check out this wonderful website which is sponsored by the city of lakewood. another excellent account of the history of birdtown can be found on this website , sponsored by the lakewood historical society. to see more photos of the sky around the world visit here! today's theme for tt is hats! in keeping with the s nap's established theme thursday tradition today's puzzler takes us to an emporium of delights. who can name this classy store which sells pretty much anything one could possibly desire? i will provide a hint in the figure of eddie, one of the store's owners, the store is not named after eddie, but is named after his charming wife. eddie strikes a pose in front of just a few of the store's many hats which are displayed above his own hatless head. as you begin to wander through the store you will encounter one treasure after another - who knows you may even encounter a hat or two in the most unexpected places! the store specializes in furniture, jewelry , pottery, and glassware. the store is opened six days a week - monday through saturday, 11 am to 6:00 pm. this evening after all the snap readers have a chance to play today's puzzler, i will come back to add the name and location of today's site to today's post - and i hope the next time you are near it you will pop in and take a wander, i'm sure you won't be disappointed, and if you are like me will be sure to find something that you just had to take home! addendum: anonymouse nailed the store right off! congratulations! this delightful shop which is owned and operated by eddie and connie dean is called connie's classics . it is located in the birdtown district of lakewood at 12603 madison avenue. stop in and tell them that you read about them on the snap! tuesday was an absolutely beautiful day! here's a few snaps from my walk around town. i met a few lakewood students who graced me with an impromptu concert! this young man strikes a pose and and diverts my eye from watching the tow truck. word to the wise - don't forget to feed those parking meters and obey the parking rules. the lakewood traffic enforcement patrol is serious! no parking worries when a skateboard is one's main means of transportation! what came into your head when you first saw this plate? the first thing that i thought of was "one left to leave" - possibly meaning the person driving this car has one kid was still at home. and, if this is the message, are we to assume that the driver of the car is looking forward to the day when all the kids are on their own or is this a statement of anticipatory grief? however, soon i thought of another possible message - what did you think of? inquiring minds would love to know. 
Female: 100%, Male, well, that's it i'm back in the real world having travelled back up through africa and slowly made my way back to the uk.my next task is to find myself a job. i also have to unpack my stuff and sort out my life. in the mean time there should be more time to do other things.i realise that there are a lot of missing holes in the blog and will make an effort to fill them in as soon as i can.watch this space. once again i have to say sorry for not updating the blog. i don't have any great excuses except to say that i have been very very busy. so busy that the only time that i have time to write an entry happens to be relief which is theoretically the busiest time down here at halley. so here is a text entry of the past the present and the future. hopefully i will get around to filling this in a bit more.so in short what has been happening? well since my last entry i have been on my final winter trip and got some amazing photos (soon to be added). new people arrived on base and we had our first plane. i finally got down to see the penguins at windy bay. apart from that its been packing packing and more packing as we shut down the science here to make space for the building of the new base. the science team has packed over 5 tonnes already and i will be packing another tonne and a half before the end of relief. all this will be sent back to cambridge or in the case of the ais (which i looked after) norway. oh yeah my leg is fine, thanks for all the support. i have even been kiting 
Female: 100%, Male,  i'm pretty excited about this. leave it to hbs to come up with the mba oath. money quote (emphasis added): "one of jeff skilling's classmates has recalled a comment the ex-ceo of enron made during a class about a dangerous consumer product: "i'd keep making and selling [it]. my job as a business man is to...maximize return to the shareholders. it's the government's job to step in if a product is dangerous." as a student today at harvard's business school, i hear echoes of those comments from my classmates ." yikes. the author goes on: "in their reverence for the individual, business schools are remarkably bad at creating a sense of common purpose beyond an ambition to make money. without a higher calling, bad actors flourish and those who want to speak out against them have little basis on which to challenge them." with much love to my hbs chums, this is not the way things are at all top business schools. and honestly, i can't imagine that (outside of a small, perhaps vocal element) that this isn't what it's really like at hbs either...is it? this is the second in a three part review of my favorite 10 shows of the decade that was. i've figured out the last show to include, but i'll save that for another post so i don't drown everybody with words. 5/05 shins in okc—a very nice show (shins sound live exactly like they do on record) that was nicer because i was there enjoying it with lauren. we hadn’t been dating that long at that point, and we drove up with our friends bill and rick. we all made it back to ft sill the next day to attend my hail and farewell from the army. i was allowed a speech, and as many know i enjoy (a bit too much) any chance to be on the microphone. my speech that day concluded with: “peace in the middle east, no blood for oil, i’m out!” and made a lot of people mad. it also caused one of my fellow officers, a 6 foot 5, 280 lbs black guy, to tell me that i was “one funky caucasian”. good times. lauren and i wrapped up the weekend with a going away party at rick’s place. great weekend, and the shins were a big part of it. 08/04 wrens/magnolia electric co in denton—drove down by myself from fort sill to denton, a city famous for death metal bands and being north of dallas. i didn’t know anyone so i chatted with either band before the show. indie shows are cool like that (especially back in 01-05 before indie blew up). both performances were strong, and it was great to see two of my faves on the same stage. after several beers at the show i slept in my car until the next morning and then drove the 4 hours home. 6/06 radiohead in berkeley—the perfect culmination to years of radiohead hero worship. memorable because of the beautiful berkeley summer night, and time spent with friends david hyman, the rotblats, and nate anthony. if i never see radiohead again it would be a shame, but i am very cool with this night being my lasting memory of the radiohead experience. 4/05 wilco in okc (2)—bill rausch and a sportsjacket. i don’t think i can legally say anything else about this show besides that. (also, go see wilco live. it’s expensive to do, nowadays, but it’s worth it.) in no order whatsoever, here is the first half of my live music retrospective on the decade that was. part 2 will run later in the week. these aren’t necessarily the 10 best shows i saw, but for one reason or another they were the 10 most memorable. (editors note—part 2 currently only has 4 shows. if you attended a really memorable show with me in the last 10 years that didn’t make it in this post, please send me some inspiration!!!) 5/03 built to spill in la—i’ve seen these guys more than any other band, and one show had to go on the list. this was easily the best show i’ve seen them play. they closed with a 15 minute version of cortez the killer during which jim roth did things with his guitar the likes of which i’ve never seen before or since. epic. i have a poster of this show on the wall of my apartment. 4/06 daft punk at coachella—i was there with several great friends berkeley friends, to include the kaplans and anna utgoff. dp wasn’t why i went to this festival, but it’s the one thing i’ll never forget about coachella. this was the first show dp did with their giant laser pyramid (top left). it was as cool as everyone says it was. 12/05 wrens in sf—i love the wrens, and they’re always great live. i had seen them maybe 6 months earlier at the pitchfork intonation music festival in chicago. at that show, for one song, they brought fans up on stage to play percussion with the band. when that song came up at this show i left my friends (dan and kelly) and pushed to the very front. i had a bruce springsteen/courtney cox moment with a member of the band, and he pulled me on stage with several fellow fans. when the singing came in i did what i do at shows—sang along. the band member, seeing i knew the words and wasn’t a completely awful singer pulled me into the mic so i could sing along with the band. we did it up, back-to-back 80s hair metal style, for the rest of the song. it was probably the coolest moment i’ve ever had at a concert, hands down. 3/06 magnolia electric co/okkervil river in austin—at sxsw i won an mba music case competition with any, april chris and sung hu. we had no passes (the guys at mccombs let us down) but a couple of us managed to hop the fence at this outdoor set and enjoy two really nice performances. 9/06 silver jews in sf—this was a good but unspectactular show on september 10th 2006. i went by myself and had made plans to try to meet up with david h, but he got held up doing other stuff. the show was memorable because i got my letter in the mail from uncle sam the next day calling me back to the army. i saw a few other good shows before i cut myself off from music in 2007 to go overseas (islands and phoenix in sf come immediately to mind) but music wasn’t quite the same for me after this show, not for a long while at least. once upon a time i loved making music lists. really, really loved it. the problem was that my list skills never quite caught up with my enthusiasm for making them. for example: i spent an entire summer in 2003 trying to come up with a mix cd worth of songs that featured hand clapping. sounds simple enough, right? but the project never really came together. in my mind, the songs had to be good, satisfactorily indie and/or ironic, and non-obvious enough that i would feel good (and snobby) about attaching my name to the list (so no “theme from friends”, etc). the whole thing started when i was driving around alaska listening to “nothing’severgonnastandinmywayagain” by wilco, a song i loved (still do) so much that i would take my hands off of the wheel to clap along with the chorus. same deal for “alone down there” by modest mouse and ted leo's “timorous me”. but those three songs ended up as the list. when i couldn’t think of any other songs that really got me excited i brought megan and her brother jeff into the conversation, and they had great suggestions that for whatever reason still didn’t quite make me happy. the final analysis: good idea, poor execution. in business school and in seattle (when i was with amazon) i made a lot of live music lists in an effort to get people to come to shows with me. it was fun, but didn't work that well either (i went to a lot of shows solo). putting all that aside, i want to start 2010 with a few music lists for old time's sake. in a couple of days i'll lay out my favorite live music experience of the last 10 years, but tonight i'm going to rank where music fits in with all the other crap going in exnicios-land circa 2000-2009. we'll call my parents emeritus to this list and not in the official running. without further ado: 1. lauren (my beautiful wife) 2. graduating duke (and all that went along with it) 3a. going to war (even if i wasn't getting shot at) 3b. being in the army generally (i'm better at push ups and shooting things than i would have been) 5. graduating from berkeley (and all that went along with it) 6. calhoun and bailey (my dog and cat) 7. music (only top 7...music's got to feel a little disappointed) 8. all of my other friends and family not captured by duke, army, berkeley, etc. 9. the washington redskins (0-1 in the new decade!) 10. all the books i read this is a test. normal 0 false false false en-us

means it’s been more than a year since i got home and picked up again with my life with lauren. in the last 14 months (nov 2008 until now) we got a dog, had a re-wedding and went to new zealand. i started working as a consultant at booz allen hamilton in march, but not until after i got to say that i was unemployed during the great economic meltdown. all told lauren and i celebrated 7 other weddings with family and friends (very fun) and had to say goodbye to one of the best guys either of us had ever met (very, very sad). lauren and i live in old town alexandria, about 5 or 6 miles outside of dc proper. we both work in the district and we’ve settled into a really nice routine. i miss blogging. a lot. i think that i’m not awful at this, and i wish i had been better about writing in 2009. but for some reason it’s been hard for me to look at army 2.0 for the last year. i don’t know why. in general i’ve had trouble engaging technology. technology was my entire focus for 2 years at haas, and i stayed pretty well connected to that world while i was in afghanistan of all places. home in dc, i feel more detached from the west coast than i ever did in the war zone. weird, i know. life is great all the same. lauren and i are really happy. and we’re going to figure the coast thing soon (by which i mean before lauren divorces me for indecision). so in conjunction with that decision, here is my 2010 to-do list: 1) re-engage technology—spend less time reading about nba teams i don’t care about and more time reading tech blogs 2) blog a couple of times a week—i appreciate that anything i say now is less interesting than anything i said while on the forward edge of freedom, but still. writing is fun. 3) for the first time, really embrace facebook and twitter—read above…poor, innocent social networking sites have suffered for the same reason my blog has. i am safely home with my family in northern virginia. as far as i know i have no further obligation to the army for the next 6 months, and after that i'll be eligible to resign my commission. sultan jeff is home as well, but chris is still over in afghanistan. he was the last of my group to arrive, and he'll be the last to come home. thank you for all of your thoughts, prayers, and well wishes (and clicks and eyeballs and links) over the last 16 months. the blog is not going to go away. we still have vps to settle on, and the irr story is something that will continue to develop as we see what direction the wars take under a new president. thanks again, and i'll talk to everyone soon.

Male: 99%, Female, whatcha got cookin'? al the retired army guy is a reader of this here blog and a student at the new england culinary institute. here's a quickie blog on of one of his latest projects. from al: here are a few pictures of a display platter my classmates and i worked on. if you’re wondering why everything appears shiny, it is because all of the food is coated in aspic (gelatin) to give the food a shine for display purposes only. it isn’t meant for consumption, though you could eat it if you wanted to. i wouldn’t mainly due to the gelatin. without the gelatin, though--> ;-) in the pictures you will find a terrine, a liver pate, and a duck galantine, as well as two vegetable garnishes. there is also a beet/pickled onion salad, with an orange vinaigrette (you can’t really see the vinaigrette). the single plate represents a single serving of the components contained in the platter. it took us about six hours to put five coats of aspic on every individual piece. the vegetables were individually carved and placed as well. i did the “pointy” rutabaga bases you see, as well as the chioggia beets (the purple ones, carved into fleurons or a crescent shape). i did the orange/white squares you see inside the circular garnish on the right side of the platter. the terrine, galantine, and liver pate were made for us by classmates and our instructor. overall it was a lot of fun. all the attention to detail i learned while in the army definitely pays off while doing things like this. - - - looks good, al. now whydontcha come over here and wrangle up something for dinner? - - - thirteen years ago, i pulled a novel from a bin at the library's used book sale and paid one dollar for it. sapphire's push immediately engaged me and i didn't put it down until i'd reached the last page. the book takes stylistic risks, with precious jones narrating her own story in a phonetically realistic voice. she is poorly dressed and obese, the sort of person many of us pass on the street and never see. therein lies the brilliance of the novel. push puts claireece precious jones and her harrowing life squarely in front of the reader. if this was difficult and compelling to watch unfold on the page , the trailer for the movie precious indicated it would be stunning on the screen as well. after much consideration, i decided to take my 12-year-old daughter to see precious. "i was really rooting for precious," i said as we talked about the movie on the way home. "me too," said jessie. i was bowled over by gabourey sidibe's portrayal of precious. if possible, she realized sapphire's vision with near perfection--as someone who is so easy to dismiss, until you really see her. then she is impossible not to embrace. to be honest, i had some literary quibbles with the novel, but my respect for the risks it took overwhelmed them. the film has received raves as well as scathing criticism for being "a strange combination of liberal guilt and condescension," which is a point well taken. i apologize that i cannot find the link now, but one of the reviews i read took issue with precious's weight saying something to the effect of must she be so fat that her face is distorted? then darling howard stern chimed in last week with his obnoxious comments about sidibe. i was infuriated by this stupidity. don't these morons realize that the driving force of precious is a main character who is the antithesis of gwyneth paltrow and reese witherspoon? her physical size is symbolic. it's one of the reasons she will not be denied. whether you're on the pick or pan side of the reviews, that ambition deserves respect. as for sidibe, i think you're beautiful, gabourey. now go bury the likes of stern with a long and illustrious career. - - - i apologize in advance for this, but some things just have to be gotten through. see what i mean? now for a random list of observations. 1. no small task keeping the cleft of venus off screen in that footage. kudos to filmmaker gary he. 2. those crystals aren't going to be very jazzly after booboo and bambam have a few rolls in the hay. 3. what if you lose some of those crystals? i mean really lose them? "um, sugarpop? the one wing of your butterfly is, like, gone." i think we all know just how embarrassing that's going to be. 4. i've always liked jennifer love hewitt. she's not a-list or b-list. she's your a-/b+ list and i can get behind that. hence, you can imagine my reaction when she goes on george lopez and announces she's had some spa-person glue beads around her zorch. who does that? 5. regarding this exciting new phenomenon, my bud steven gould had this to say, "i'm still a guy who prefers hair, uh, hairy, uh, you know. vahaired." i think he's onto something with "vahaired." with all this new shit coming down the pike, we're going to need titles, categories--the whole drill. 6. i wonder if there are guys out there with beads stuck around their peckers. i wouldn't ever want to see any dickazzled or ballazzled anything. nope, regular big hairy guys with beer for me. (did you notice how i got right behind steven on the new age vocabulary job? i'm cool like that.) 7. i bet snooki is jazzled in places jennifer love hewitt can't even imagine. 8. you've probably noticed by now i'm avoiding the word "vajazzled." it makes me nervous. a word like that lands in your life and boy are you stuck with it. i don't like ultimatums, so i deal with this sort of thing in my own way. hence this post. 9. i refer to my own pudendum as glorious steinem. - - - "i can’t think of anything that i liked in my twenties that i would want tattooed on my body now. okay, maybe chicken parmesan, but that would take up too much space." now go read the rest of my good buddy paul ita's latest essay for masslive: my horrible tattoo: a cautionary tale for america's young people. - - - the above word cloud is courtesy of wordle. i cannot get enough of that silly gadget. to have your work instantaneously analyzed and transformed into a piece of literary artwork is like masturbation for writers. after alex pruteanu introduced me to it yesterday, i fooled around wordling this blog, old articles, even my writing bio. the source text for today's wordle cloud was lifted from an article wherein i recount a professional "girlie" photo session, which explains the photo on the left (yes, that is your humble hostess). you can read the full text of the article here. - - - fifty degrees and sunny. the cabin-fever crazed o'brien can finally walk outside despite all the blasted snowdrifts. riunite lambrusco, anyone? above the bar at cleve-o mega hot spot melt. the goat bought a new goatmobile. yay, goat! the old goatmobile looked sad when we left it at the dealer. boohoo and bye-bye, old goatmobile. indian spirit money house blessing rainbow incense sticks--only six for a dollar at the discount grocery. man-o-man, my luck never ends. sorry, ghost of george carlin. come-hither bra display at the low grade closeout store. "honey, springtime is high time for a new toilet." - - - a post chock full of writing tips for all the young writers who contact me with questions about this crazy business and craft. last updated 3/8/10. - - - start local and small. my first paid bit of writing was for ohio writer . for my 900-word book review of judith hemschemeyer's the harvest , i was paid the royal sum of $10. that was in june of 2000 (you can see how the next ten years unfolded for me here ). building a professional writing portfolio and the associated career takes time, and it sprouts from humble beginnings. if i were starting out today, i'd probably fish around for casual blogs associated with professional publications. many daily and weekly print papers have online blogs that might not pay much, but would be an excellent place to earn a link and a bonafide publishing credential. who knows? if an editor likes your style, it might lead to something more serious (and lucrative). bonus tip: leave a few comments on a blog (under your real name) that you might like to write for before querying the editor with your idea. small local papers are often looking for writers to cover things like school board meetings and local government. these usually are paying gigs. i spent five years doing that sort of thing for the broadview journal . that stint earned me experience, street smarts, clips, a bit of local notoriety, and a steady paycheck. get involved with a local literary or publishing organization. here in cleveland, we have the lit, cleveland digital publishing users group (cdpug) , and the cleveland society of professional journalists. these types of organizations host all sorts of events, parties, and classes where you will meet professional writers and editors. if you want to be one of these people, you have to support what they do. that means buying their books, paying the club fees and having a genuine interest in their community. it means learning from them in an organic sense. this is perhaps the most important piece of advice i can offer a new writer. i'm sure there are plenty of online sources as well. many professional journalists i know are members of freelance success for example. go to the library. there you will find droves of books dedicated to publishing and writing advice. librarians are wonderful and can always make good suggestions. in my home library, i have a shelf full of writer's market editions. two other good books to start with are the first five pages and the elements of style. mind your manners in a cold contact. don't ask established writers for big favors. never send them unsolicited writing to critique. also, don't ask a writer to do your work for you. finding the right publications to query is hard work. the question, "where can i publish this?" is almost never appropriate. get online and start researching for yourself, or go find a copy of the lmp. follow guidelines. when you're ready to submit, follow the guidelines on the agent's or publisher's site. if there are none, a one-page query is your best bet. never use cutesy fonts or graphics or anything that discredits your professionalism. get tough. the more successful a writer is, the more rejection they've faced because they toughed it out and lived to submit another day. if you want to achieve success, you will get kicked. hard. and repeatedly. when you get a rejection, send out another query the same day. it will help you keep your game face on. sometimes you have to resort to plan b and rethink your approach or your project, but giving up gets you no where. your submission or query will likely get rejected again and again--until the one day when it gets accepted. be warned: there is a growing trend in the publication industry wherein the powers that be simply do not respond to submissions that don't interest them. all you can do about "passive" rejections is keep a meticulous spreadsheet detailing all your queries with dates, names, pertinent websites, etc. include any special notes as well. how long you wait to give up on getting a response is up to you, although sometimes an agency or publication will have response time info on their webpage. simultaneous submissions? again, your call. you are your own publicist. the days of the reclusive and mysterious writer sucking deeply from a winston before his trusty royal typewriter are gone. you must represent yourself and you must do it online. prospective agents and publishers are busy people with no patience for ineptitude. if your information is more than a click away, you'll lose them. i recommend you maintain two types of webpage. this blog is my main active webpage. content here is frequently updated. here is my static/informational site. content there does not change very often. if you are just starting out, your static page might simply include some education and contact information, and your active page may be a twitter account. however you choose to do it, you must have these things. design, develop and shape them in a way that properly represents you and your work. they will evolve with you. they will surprise you as well. bonus tip #1: google docs is a brilliant tool for creating static public webpages. bonus tip #2: the way you drive a readership to your blog is by going to other sites that have the sort of readers you are trying to attract and leaving brilliant comments. and now for some miscellaneous links: they don't call it "submission" for nothing. where i go to bellyache about writing. a whole podcast featuring erin on writing. lastly, a bit of nostalgia. when i was a kid, i had a mattel knit magic toy. you threaded the yarn through this squiggly little thing in the front, turned the crank, and presto! a knitted tube would come out the bottom of the plastic machine. you were supposed to be able to do all sorts of things with the tubes, make groovy hats and stuffed dolls and scarves, but all i ever ended up with was a long tube, (although i did love my knit magic machine). when i lead discussions on writing, i often say that there is no essay magic machine, wherein you thread an idea in, turn a crank and watch an essay wind out from the bottom. the process i go through in order to produce a good solid piece of writing is laborious, wonderful, frustrating, difficult and satisfying. it has matured through the years. it is important to be in love with your process, to truly revel in the revelations, and savor the small victories. if you focus solely on that "big" publication, you risk missing the small and wonderful things that happen along the way. write because you have something to say and your own way to say it. write because you are driven to the craft. above all, write because we need the good writers. we need their words and observations. we need them to scale and record the human condition. i will likely revise this page from time to time, so stop by again. and if you have good news, bad news, or your own advice to share, please do tell all in the comment section. best of luck, erin - - - my daughter had a tummy ache yesterday and we soothed it with many things, including a healthy dose of mtv's liquid television, which was one of my favorites shows of all time. we have about six hours of liquid television on vhs (taped in the 90s), so there was enough for this tummy ache and the next one as well. it worked perfect-as-you-please in the tape player that's still hooked up to our shitty 20" crt television. i swear, people, this is how you win. - - -

we should all be so lucky! now at least everyone has a chance to own an item or two from oprah's closet. from today to march 11th, oprah's auctioning off 168 pieces of her wardrobe, including handbags, shoes, and clothes. all proceeds go to benefit oprah's leadership academy. prices are already getting high on the first day, but take a peek: oprah's ebay auction . &nbsp; ladies, i know many of you are handy and like to play "project runway" at home (so do i, when the mood strikes). most of the vogue patterns, including the vintage vogue patterns that have silhouettes from the 1930s to 1950s, are on sale for $5.75 until end of friday at voguepatterns.com . i bought 3 from the vintage (including the 1950s pinup aprons) and 2 from the misses, all for $30-something including shipping! &nbsp; $39 halogen pleat shoulder cardigan . nordstrom. how cute are they?! i bought two: hibiscus and black (goodness knows, one can never have too many black cardigans). &nbsp; i hope everyone has a great day today, whether in a couple or single. it's really a day for telling everyone we love&#8212;family, friends, pets&#8212;that we care and are glad they are in our lives. so this is me, telling you :) xx gg image from the cover of the march 1928 film fun magazine, by enoch bolles. from the romeo & juliet photoshoot by annie leibovitz for the december 2008 issue of vogue. &nbsp; i woke up to hear the news: lee mcqueen has died at age 40. he was found dead in his london home, having committed suicide due to depression which set in after his mother's death last week. my thoughts go out to his friends and family. on the alexander mcqueen website is this statement: "on behalf of lee mcqueen's family, alexander mcqueen today announces the tragic news that lee mcqueen, the founder and designer of the alexander mcqueen brand, has been found dead at his home. at this stage it is inappropriate to comment on this tragic news beyond saying that we are devastated and are sharing a sense of shock and grief with lee's family. lee's family has asked for privacy in order to come to terms with this terrible news and we hope the media will respect this." while most of us fans and fashion lovers never knew him personally, we feel the loss keenly. mcqueen was an exciting, inspiring designer and, through his clothes and runway shows, he made a connection with us. he will be missed for a long time to come. wendy brandes posted this video of a holographic kate moss floating in air like an angel, in an ethereal alexander mcqueen gown. i agree &#8212; one of the most beautiful things ever to grace a runway. there will be no more posts today, out of respect for a great designer, who left this world too soon. photo: marcio madeira / vogue 
Male: 100%, Male,  even if you don't know, want, or care about the product. everybody wants an interesting unexpected twist to their day. http://www.moillusions.com/2008/05/deceiving-billboard-ads-part-ii.html people embarrassing themselves singing is fun to watch...but it's worth sticking around for the punchline. it's refreshing to hear a huge company sound a little human by admitting what people are really using their visa cards for. isn't it beautiful when an idea is so simple and well executed that you don't even need to describe it? link to source. this uk schick ad uses some pretty funny sexual innuendo to sell female razors.  this will not likely see any airtime in the north american market.  how long before people stop being offended by tame humor like this?   coolest chameleon ever genius viral marketing.  let's try and reverse engineer the creative process here: 1. ray-ban glasses come in lots of colors...which is pretty cool. 2. lots of colors....what has lots of colors...hmmmm...chameleon! 3. show a chameleon adapting to the different ray-ban's and make a cool video set to trendy music!  bingo bango...it's a hit.  it didn't cost much and mllions of people have seen it already.  for me personally it kind of even worked.  when i think ray-ban i think men in black ...not the look for me.  but the other colors looked kind of cool.  this isn't their first viral hit either.  here's another one from 2007. using the media an ad is displayed on creatively is awesome when done well.  i've lots of cool ads on elevators before, but this list of the top ten coolest escalator ads is pretty amazing.  i wonder how many people stumbled a bit as they were surprised by these ads.  it would be fun to grab an orange julius and watch people go up the escalator for a while.   the wine industry is a curious market. thousands of products are basically indistinguishable without sampling. massive variations in price exist between seemingly similar products. many top brands are available regionally and in scarce supply. therefore, to the casual consumer (most consumers) the choice of a wine is overwhelming. this makes the packaging extremely important. on a rack of 10 chilean syrah's you've never heard of before the only information you have to work with are packaging and price. there are essentially no features and benefits. you make a snap decision and hope for the best. this list shows 25 brilliant wine bottle designs that no doubt grab the buyers attention and boost sales. b.c. is home to many great wines which don't often make lists like the one above because of their limited distribution. a great example is blasted church vineyards which feature unique labels by artist monika melnychuk which get people's attention. the wine is pretty good too so people some back for more. this guitar shop in southampton, england made the most of the security barrier that covers the store front when they are closed. for their efforts they now have worldwide exposure thanks to the good old world wide web (not just on my blog). 
Female: 100%, Male,  who ever thought up daylight savings time should be punished in cruel and unusual ways. this just helps prove that i am not and never will be a ‘morning person’ tanks to endless supra for the great photo. finally i am starting a new project that i have been waiting to do for a long time. i am calling it the "4-5" table because i was lucky enough to obtain two planks of solid elm that were the 4th and 5th sequential cuts (of 15) from a large local fallen elm tree. the 3x3 post pictured are maple. the grain it amazing and i plan to work in the natural exposed edge to the design. i am really excited about this one. pheasant hunting in brown city this morning. cold wet and muddy. perfect. but: thanks to christoph niemann for the artwork. i just recieved a really dumb email. it's so many kinds of wrong i feel like i should take the sender aside and spend the time to explain why. the problem with email is it allows people to spread stupid at the speed of the internet. sometimes i feel like i am fighting a blizzard of dumb with a plastic spoon of common sense. aka a glimpse at how my mind works: (to myself) what is today? 3/11? i like 3/11’s music i really need to sort out my music library. i never did by a 2nd drive to back up my back up drive. i think my ‘membership’ for ecost expired. expired? i never did put the registration stickers on the plane. i have to get out to the hanger soon. the weather is nice finally, but is supposed to rain. i hope it does not rain went i go hunting this weekend. am i going to be able to hunt with my thumb bandaged up? better call ron and talk to him. where did i put those filson pants? shit i have to cut the wood for the shelves the girl wanted before i go. i really want to start on that shop project. i have to call mike about the welding stuff. what time is it? craptastic… i’m running late. things i am so not interested in: anything that is on tv right now. the kitty's fleeting inerest in sitting in my lap. anything with teen vampires. more cold weather. going to work tomorow. normal 0 false false false microsoftinternetexplorer4 /- style definitions -/ table.msonormaltable {mso-style-name:"table normal"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:"times new roman"; mso-ansi-language:#0400; mso-fareast-language:#0400; mso-bidi-language:#0400;} no thumb wednesday: buttons are my foe keyboard laughs behind my back no thumb is no fun if you remember i cut myself the other day , and i did a number on it... its taking a while to heal. thanks to savage chickens for the cartoon. 
Male: 100%, Male, i was first exposed to ex number five via the clunky yet harmless razor freestyle scooter video game. yeah, remember those razor scooters? every kid on the block had one back then. despite not having anything in common whatsoever, the band gained a decent amount of public appeal from that game, and for good cause. they meant business when it came to their craft and musicianship, even down to perfecting the post-hardcore act; twin guitars lash out monstrous, melodic riffs that interchange, harmonize and play off of each other in a way that pulses as the group's lead auxiliary. alf bartone fronts a unique and powerful voice that gives their songs an extra injection of steroids, yet he manages to keep away from standard screamo territory. even drummer luke bodenstein proved to be a vital asset with his diverse patterns and intricate fills, dropping serious onslaughts that drive each song home. the band has had a couple different bassists, but chris newman certainly threw in a meaty low-end on their later recordings.preceded by a number of demos, the team players association can be considered ex number five's true output of studio material. my only gripe with an otherwise solid rock album is it only includes nine tracks. "(not) go" was the best of the two songs featured on razor freestyle scooter, yet is sorely missed on the record and would have been an excellent bookend for the band's short-lived run. 
Male: 99%, Male, it's not every day you lose someone you spent twenty years in space with. that's dan o'bannon i'm glaring at in this scene from dark star. we were never close, even though we did share a very cozy control room on that space ship. nevertheless, i was always impressed with his talents, which ran deep in a various directions. i remember reading an interview where he described watching an early screening of dark star in which the audience wasn't laughing. it upset him that they didn't realize it was a comedy so he set out to scare the crap out of them instead...and wrote alien. that worked! i'm obviously glad that dark star came to find cult status over time. dan's name should always be mentioned in the same breath as john carpenter when dark star is mentioned. i have no doubt that when i die dan will be waiting to torment me with a rubber chicken once again. he was that kind of guy.
Male: 100%, Male, a driver's license gives you a certain level of freedom, but it also gives you an enormous amount of responsibility. when behind the wheel this responsibility comes in many forms : - wearing seat belts - driving sober - focusing on the road - driving defensively in jan. 2009, nsc called for a nationwide ban on all cell phone use while driving. this comes after nsc researchers and statisticians reviewed more than 50 peer-reviewed research reports, many drawing the same conclusion. drivers who use their cell phones have a significantly increased chance of getting into a car accident. making our world safer ... national safety council salt lake criminal justice 145 e. 1300 so. starts 6:30pm come early to sign in.

Male: 100%, Male, i have no interest whatsoever in defending the latest round of ridiculous buck-passing going on in the house. the idea, apparently, is that they're going to pass the raft of fixes to the health care bill and simply 'deem' the senate bill passed. somehow this is supposed to reduce process-based attacks from the republicans. the mind boggles. sometimes you wonder how the democratic party hasn't self-immolated yet. we're talking about an absolute core principle of the party. if you aren't interested in trying to get millions of more people some basic health care than what exactly are you doing in the party anyway? and if, even worse, you're dennis kucinich, how can you sleep at night knowing how much good this bill would do but still opposing it because it doesn't achieve the purity of alien-inspired dreams? but now we're facing the possibility that living, breathing people who were capable of getting themselves elected to the house of representatives in the most powerful country the world has ever seen are simultaneously so stupid that they think this legislative rigmarole is going to help them. while i've stated repeatedly that all the fuss about the 'cornhusker kickback' and such things is mostly an illusion generated by the process, apparently house democrats are absolutely terrified of it. so terrified that they're not even willing to go on record as having voted for the bill that contains it. despite the fact that they're going to turn around and immediately vote for another bill that removes it. a bill, by the way, that will be immensely popular and create a serious bind for the republicans. because if they just do this the old-fashioned way, the initial vote to pass the senate bill makes health care the law of the land. they pass it and obama signs it and it's law. at that point, the republicans in congress are going to be faced with a seriously deadly choice. they can continue to go nuts and vote against everything health care related--but that will put them on record as attempting to sustain the 'cornhusker kickback' and the 'big apple buyout' and the 'sooner snicker-doodles' or whatever. or, they can vote for the patch and seriously undermine their "health care is going to pay for rahm emanuel to kill your grandmother in a big field of corn" message. since they will have voted for a bipartisan fix to it. but no, the democrats want to get all fancy now, and adopt a mechanism that is questionably constitutional and stupid on the merits . the whole democratic establishment has drawn battle lines now . obama, the house leadership, the senate leadership, unions, everyone. they're all making it clear that this needs to pass and that they're willing to completely withdraw electoral support for people who don't join in - even to the point of funding primary opponents. and good for them. even if it wasn't politically smart (which it is), there are some moments when you just have to do what is right and let the chips fall where they may. i don't often like what will saletan has to say, but his recent piece on this is spot-on: maybe passing the health care bill will bring on a republican tsunami. maybe it will create a generation of democrats who revere obama the way their great-grandparents revered fdr. maybe you'll be back in congress next year. maybe you won't. either way, this is too big a vote to cast on the basis of politics. every so often, a bill comes along that's bigger than anything your predecessor got to touch. you're the lucky bastard who had your seat in 2010, when that bill reached the floor. and here you are, worrying about your career, when the purpose of your career is staring you in the face. it's time to just pass the damn bill already. if congress wasn't full of egotistical maniacs who wanted to get everything juuuuust right this would have passed three or four months ago. or in january. or february. but better late than never. just pass the damn thing and demonstrate that you're not total goobers. begging to bleed - foundation the reason i like this song is that it really reminds me of "let my love open the door," except with a folksy style that reminds me a lot of the billy bragg/wilco project. if that sounds appealing to you, then you'll probably like this one a lot. if not, well, i warned you. the album is called chimborazo , and it came out last year. are house republicans really going to try to run ads accusing the democrats of voting for unpopular parts of the senate bill like the ‘cornhusker kickback’? really? i know political attention spans are often as short as goldfish, but surely the counter-ad “i voted for a bill to ensure that the cornhusker kickback was removed, while my opponent voted against that bill” would be pretty damning. unless the republicans are planning on voting for the patch – and thus completely ruining their “obama = health care = teh socialism = zomgs” message? okay, so they're not reuniting. but they are playing a show together in july. and (for all the people who have lamented being unable to actually obtain their music after hearing me rave about them), they're re-releasing their albums through my new favorite record label, hardly art . in addition, they've got a compilation coming out on july 13, called they’ll only miss you when you leave: songs 1996 – 2003. my only complaint on that front is that it's got only a couple tracks from ugly but honest (my #1 album of the past decade ). but when there's so much great stuff to choose from, you can't really get it wrong. track list for the compilation record: 1. low budget slow motion soundtrack song for the leaving scene 2. die 3. the color that your eyes changed with the color of your hair 4. one night stand 5. you should be hated here 6. drunk with the only saints i know 7. phantom fireworks 8. so you wanna be a superhero 9. brooke daniels' tiny broken fingers 10. ignorant piece of shit 11. blessed arms that hold you tight, freezing cold and alone 12. blue champagne glass 13. september come take this heart away 14. all apologies and smiles, yours truly, ugly valentine 15. sympathy bush 16. they'll only miss you when you leave jonathan chait is weirdly puzzled over the lyrics to "you're so vain" by carly simon (which is not about david geffen , despite what you may have heard). chait says: "[n]othing about the song makes any sense. she's giving an extremely detailed description of a former lover, but insisting that his being able to recognize the description is evidence of vanity." but that's why it's clever! the whole point of the song is that the person is vain, smug, self-satisfied, thinks the world revolves around himself...and is wholly justified in thinking so. at least in respect to the narrator. the song is about him, after all. it works in the same way that a great "i'm soooo over you" song works. if you were really over them, you wouldn't have to write a song about it. and if she wasn't obsessed with him, then his vanity wouldn't be a problem. right? and then there's a whole additional layer, which is that she has played the vagueness of the subject matter into a multiple-decade-long mystery. so obviously the specific stuff is meant to be true in spirit but not literally correct. the result being: there are quite a few people who might think the song is about them - and by doing so it becomes a song about them. get it? anyways, it's more fun to not know than it ever would be to get an answer. puppets - jose vanders the puzzlingly named jose vanders (as in, she's a she) is embedded firmly in the grand tradition of waif-voiced folksy women playing sweet songs about love and life and growing up. think of a young regina spektor with a bit of the kate nash snark. i realize that for some people that might not sound like an endorsement - in which case you're probably better off just passing through. but for those who like a little bit of sweetness in their lives, give this one a listen. in addition to being simple, pure, serene...it's also a lot of fun. the general theme ("i'm a puppet for you") doesn't feel overdone, and the clapping (following the line "i've got strings tied to my fingers, pull them down, and i'll clap for you") is amusing without treading into being precious. "puppets" is from an ep called red, black, blue, and the tortoise , which came out a couple years ago. fit - windmill (from puddle city racing lights ) perfect fit - laurel music (from this night and the next ) so i'm thinking about buying a new car. this is a pretty major deal since i've been driving the same dodge caravan for about 12 years now. and while i love the old minivan, the recognition of rising gas prices and the initial investment required to buy a car designed for a family leads me to believe i really ought to buy a nice little fuel-efficient car. i think i've settled on the honda fit. it gets great reviews, good gas mileage, is among the cheaper options out there, and apparently has the coolest folding back seat in the world which actually produces some reasonably good storage space for a small car. the question i have for you, gentle blog-readers, is this: do you have any experience, positive or negative, with the fit? is it a good choice? should i be considering something else? i've written about slapstick a few times before - and it seems strange to keep coming back to a band that's been defunct for a decade at this point. but still, i just can't say no. the excuse this time is my discovery of some tracks from them that had completely slipped under my radar. way back in the day i picked up their slapstick cd, which i believed to be a complete collection of their released material. turns out there's some other stuff floating around, including this track, which embodies everything there is to love about the band: i hate girls - slapstick like a cold gust of chicago wind reaching us all the way from some dark club in the 90s filled with snotty ska-punk of the very best sort. a dirty guitar riff, horns that rise out and above, lyrics about lusting after a girl at a jawbreaker show, and that absolutely glorious "la la, la la la la la" chorus. what's not to like? 
Male: 100%, Male, as another cross blog venture, my good pals at the philosophy of time travel and lastbestangryman have invited me to participate in a number of top 5 lists as this decade draws to a close. we have very different musical tastes in terms of our favorite stuff, but i also think we all are willing to listen to a lot of different stuff so there is some crossover. lists like this are by their very nature completely subjective, but the point has always been to simply tell everybody they are wrong about everything. 5) kid a by radiohead this album represents for me the height of radiohead's greatness - better than everything that came before and much better than everything that has come since. they take their first steps here into really stretching into experimentation but still keep some pop hooks, and the result is just tremendous. everybody knows at least one or two songs by radiohead just from osmosis, but what is interesting is that all these years later, you still have a chance of hearing something from the bends or ok computer on your radio but very little chance of hearing anything from this album which surely must be their best. 4) yankee hotel foxtrot by wilco this album is for wilco what the love song of j. alfred prufrock must have been like for t.s. eliot: once you produce something this good, how can you live up to it again? keeping with that analogy, we still haven't seen wilco's equivalent of the waste land . they are still making great music (and i just saw them in concert this year incidentally), but they've never been able to replicate the heights of fancy and genius they hit with this album early in the decade. that's not a knock against the band as few have ever hit heights like this. from the very beginning lyrics: "i am an american aquarium drinker" you know you are going to get something a little bit different - but through it all it remains a coherent, sometimes heartbreaking but ultimately hopeful work that stands as something to be listened to from beginning to end. 3) good apollo, i'm burning star iv, vol 1: from fear through the eyes of madness by coheed and cambria rock band was basically the greatest thing to happen to these guys in terms of popularity as the fantastic track "welcome home" from this particular album is featured in the game, and was also featured in the preview for the movie "9". but more than just that particular single, this is the 3rd album in a series of 4 that comprise an entire sci-fi rock opera by the group, telling a singular tale that, while often clumsy/impenetrable in terms of narrative, serves to tie the whole project together in a single thread. this 3rd volume is in my opinion the strongest with so many great tunes that stand alone, but in particular "ten speed (of god's blood and burial)" and "apollo i: the writing writer" rise to such bizarre heights of creativity in subject matter while at the same time keeping coherent metal hooks - it's just brilliant stuff all around. all 4 albums are terrific, but this one for me is the best of the project. 2) takk.. by sigur ros sigur ros stands alone in their own category of music making right now for me insofar as i firmly believe they are the most important band out there today. you could argue there are other bands that are better but the reason sigur ros is so essential is they are in the unique position of being legitimately popular . how this, by pop standards, weird group from iceland became pop icons is completely lost on me but i'm totally okay with it because it really shows that all is not lost - people will listen to truly great music given the opportunity. if you had told me when agaetis byrjun was released that "svefn-g-englar" would feature prominently on an episode of the tv show "v", i would've told you that was patently absurd. it was very difficult to choose between this album and () (also called "two sausages kissing" in jest) only because () was probably more important for the band's development, but i've listened to takk.. too many times not to make this the album i choose. i remember hearing glosoli for the first time when i saw the band in concert - they were touring just before the release of takk.. - and having my mind utterly blown. when i think of the platonic model of "hope", i think of that song. 1) lateralus by tool this is bar none my favorite band, and this is my favorite album by that band. i get it that tool isn't for everybody (just people who know what they're talking about), but it is tough to find a musician anywhere who won't at least admit that these guys are all absolutely ridiculous when it comes to the technical talent on display at every instrument in this band. perfect circle is a nice project for maynard and i enjoy them, but this is where maynard's home is, and this is where he does his best work. it's amazing that this album came out in 2001 and nothing has come out that has been better, including tool's own 10,000 days which, while awesome, didn't quite hit the level of lateralus simply because track for track there are absolutely no weaknesses on lateralus. perhaps the way i can most easily sum up the level of this band is to relay this story: after seeing this band in concert with one of my friends who is a musician, he simply turned to me and said "well, that was intimidating." indeed. some context for below - tonight the local minor league team, the wilmington blue rocks , are having "cowboy monkey rodeo night", which involves monkeys dressed as cowboys riding on dogs. this led to the chat below with a good friend: me: tonight is awesome &nbsp;&nbsp;cowboy monkey rodeo night + fireworks &nbsp;&nbsp;monkeys in cowboy outfits riding dogs friend: shouldn;t they be called dogboy monkies? me: cowboy monkey will lasso you good for suggesting this &nbsp;&nbsp;they don't round up dogs &nbsp;&nbsp;they ride them friend: yeah true &nbsp;&nbsp;what do they round up? squirrels? &nbsp;&nbsp;cows??? me: what they round up are good times &nbsp;&nbsp;goodtimeboy monkeys friend: now that would be illegal - making monkeys round up squirrels while riding dogs &nbsp;&nbsp;then - you feed the losing team to a shark &nbsp;&nbsp;that's good times me: i don't want to live in a country where you can't watch monkeys dressed as cowboys riding dogs herding squirrels tossing them to sharks &nbsp;&nbsp;and you can quote me on that one of the many things that makes baseball the greatest sport in the world is that it represents stability - every march, players start training for april. every april, thousands of fans show up for opening day at their respective ballparks, filled with the hope of possibility - even if their team is predicted to lose 100 games this year, it hasn't happened yet: everybody starts 0-0. as the oft maligned former commissioner bart giamatti said: it breaks your heart. it is designed to break your heart. the game begins in the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone. in other words, it appeals because there is so little about the game that ever changes. it is as familiar as the spring, as familiar as the sun rising and setting. when harry kalas died yesterday, it surprised me that it hurt. it didn't seem to me at first like i had any right to really be affected: after all, i didn't know harry personally. i never met the man. i was just a phillies fan, one that probably took him for granted too often like many others, so used to him calling the games that it didn't even cross my mind that someday, he wouldn't be around to do it. harry called every phillies game of my entire life - his presence was as ubiquitous as the phillies themselves, as baseball itself. i stare out the window at what is a gloomy day here in delaware, and i know the spring will come. i know that everyone will eventually move on, myself included, because baseball, like life, goes on. but for right now, for this moment, harry is gone, and with him the spring and the promise that both it and baseball bring. the promise they represent - that there are windows of opportunity in life where anything seems possible - for now seems to have disappeared. the feeling will pass, as all things do, and no matter how much we might want things to stay the same, no matter how much we might want to turn on the game tomorrow night and hear harry call it, comforted by the familiarity of it all, it won't happen. we learn to adjust. baseball represents that too, you know: the game may not change, but the people do. it's not a bad thing or a good thing, it just is. right now though, i just want it to feel like spring, the way it did on sunday when the phillies won and harry called the game, and everything was exactly as i thought it should be on an afternoon in april - and now can't ever be precisely the same again. i absolutely love movies, but i dislike going to the movie theater . in the past 2 years i've seen maybe a half dozen movies in the theater, and very rarely will i go on a busy movie day (like a friday night) if i go at all. i like a nice sunday matinee, but really with tvs and dvd players being what they are, with all of the easy access we have to movies via netflix, movie channels, tivo, netflix on tivo, etc. it just seems kind of silly sometimes to go to a movie theater when i (personally) can be guaranteed to enjoy the experience at home. going to the movie theater is not a sure good time, mostly because of the occasional rudeness of other movie-goers. but sometimes you just can't avoid the hype and you find yourself unwilling to wait for the dvd release. my buddies at lastbestangryman and the philosophy of time travel agreed we would all post our top 5 most anticipated films of 2009. here's the top 5 movies i'm most likely to see in the theater in 2009, which by proxy means they are the most anticipated: 5) 9 - this film will mark the real feature film directing debut for shane acker , who really cut his teeth doing animation with weta during the lord of the rings films. here's the deal with this one - acker made a 10 minute or so short film around the concept a few years ago. the movie is embedded below. the film coming out in theaters this year is the whole story. the visual style is super cool and i'm always a fan of animation in all its incarnations. short film "9": feature film trailer, featuring a terrific song by coheed and cambria : 4) the lovely bones - there are two big reasons i'm looking forward to seeing this. number one, the book is absolutely terrific and for me exceeded the critical hype. number two, peter jackson is directing, and the material from the book is something i think he could prepare a feast with. no trailer available yet. 3) the wrestler - this movie is technically out right now in the us but only under limited release. i check every weekend to see if it is out around delaware but so far no luck. the number one reason i want to see this: i haven't seen a darren aronofsky movie yet that i haven't loved. i also have a soft spot in my heart for the material here because when i was a kid i was a huge fan of pro wrestling. there's a lot of oscar talk swirling around mickey rourke's performance in this one, if that kind of stuff matters to you. 2) public enemies - it's a 1930s crime drama starring christian bale and johnny depp directed by michael mann. if you need any more explanation than that i have no idea what to tell you. 1) watchmen - i'm worried about this movie. really, really worried. there is a very good reason that watchmen is the only graphic novel on time's 100 greatest novels list: it is an absolute masterpiece. it is also really, really complex and has always seemed like it would be a nightmare to faithfully translate to the big screen. we already know that at least one key element (the tales of the black freighter framing device) will not be in the movie. there are more and more reports suggesting that the ending has been changed. the director's original 3 hour cut was apparently loathed by the studio and who knows if it will survive tampering. the whole thing is a recipe for a colossal disaster. but i had a lot of the same skepticism with lord of the rings , and boy was i completely wrong there. this easily gets #1 because it is probably the only movie i will definitely see this year in the theater, and that's because there's no way i'll be able to avoid it. a great deal of my friends love the graphic novel as much as i do, and i'll be unable to avoid discussions of this movie when it is finally out. hopefully they will be discussions about how we were totally wrong about all our concerns over the movie. you don't need to know the ins and outs of the israeli-palestinian conflict to know that it's bad. in fact, it has been so bad for so long that whenever another bombing or act of terrorism is reported, it just seems to roll like water off a duck's back for most folks. it says something when a story of cooperation is more unexpected and surprising than a story of people blowing each other up. it says something sad about the way things are there. but it also says something awe inspiring at just how far some people will go to try to change things, even on the tiniest of levels. ------- when you say "football", people from different parts of the world will think of different things. most, of course, will think of what we call in america "soccer". in australia though, they think of their own variation of "rugby" - australian rules football. in 2002, australia hosted the first ever australian football international cup . the idea was to promote interest in the sport in other countries by hosting a tournament that australia itself would not participate in. it's the kind of thing i can't imagine america bothering to host - we'd want to win our own tournament, after all. but since australia has the only professional league for their unique sport, it made sense to sit out this tournament because winning was almost guaranteed. why not give other teams playing their sport in other countries a chance to compete and measure their talents? the tournament was enough of a success that it was hosted again in 2005, and now it will happen a third time here in 2008. this year 16 teams from around the world will compete for the trophy, the most since the tournament started. when you look at the list of teams competing , one jumps out at you: peace team . a strange name for a side participating in a rough and tumble game. ------- in january of 2008, australian football legend robert "dipper" dipierdomenico, along with some other league representatives, presented the rules of the game to a room full of 100 young men. out of that 100, 40 were selected to participate in a 3 day clinic to learn the basics of the game. the unusual part of the story: these young men were a mix of israelis and palestinians, and the clinic was in jerusalem. perhaps crazy enough was the idea of getting a team of men completely unfamiliar with the sport ready to compete internationally in just under 8 months. but even crazier was the idea of trying to do it here, with these men. the team faced complications trying to train that would be completely unheard of elsewhere. the coach's instructions needed to be translated to both hebrew and arabic. the team was shut out of their israeli training facility for 4 days during a visit by president bush when all palestinians were denied access, including palestinian members of the team. team members received threats from both sides of the conflict, either enduring the usual hate from one side or being called "traitor" by the other. palestinian team members needed to obtain work permits for every training session, sometimes traveling upwards of 4 hours through various security checkpoints. the pressure was too much for a number of the players. some of them, facing threats from their own friends and neighbors, left the team. in spite of all of this, a few kept practicing. a few kept playing. in spite of the lack of a proper field (they played on soccer fields) with proper goalposts (they had none), they kept learning. the first time the team had seen real goal posts was when they arrived in australia a week ago. they play their first match of the tournament today against great britain. ------- new zealand and ireland will be the favorites going into the tournament. the peace team will probably be lucky to win a single match. but win or lose, they will do it together . "everyone knows the story in israel and palestine, the occupation, the killings, bombings, we came here to show the people, we came for the peace, we need the peace," says palestinian ruckman fares switte. in january, it's not likely fares switte knew what a ruckman was. but then again, in january, the whole notion of a team like this was pretty unlikely too. ------- after the tournament is over, the players on the peace team will return to their normal lives. they will return to face the same strife and conflict they faced before they started playing together. they might even return to find themselves reviled in their own homes. but they'll return changed in this small way, knowing this simple thing: if we can play together, we can live together. ------- note: for a tremendous introduction to the various factions and pieces in play in the israeli-palestinian conflict, i can't recommend the game peacemaker enough. it is easily the most engaging introduction i've ever seen, better even than any book i have read on the topic. and yes, it has a mac version. it's an ever shrinking world. on the one hand it means we tend to fight a little more over resources that we all need. on the other hand, it means we have a better opportunity than ever to learn to live with each other. i'm a big fan of the olympics. i'm talking about an event where we get to see sports that we probably won't see for another 4 years, but with a built in rooting interest. we root for our country. we root for the human interest stories. we root for the ideal that we can all, just maybe, get along for a couple weeks. of course the ideal is not reality. the olympics are bringing some of china's questionable government practices out into the world spotlight. the games are sometimes overshadowed by stories of the conflict in georgia. in spite of these things, sport goes on. the beauty of sport as a fan is that, for the duration of the match, game, whatever, you aren't thinking about those things. it is not a good idea to ignore what goes on in this world. but it's not a bad thing to set it aside once in awhile. ----- imagine you've got a tumor in your belly growing so large that it begins to push all of your internal organs, liver, intestine, kidneys... all to the sides of your body. imagine that the hospital that is trying to treat you has just been taken over by a group that is likely to kill you if they see you. imagine that it doesn't matter anyway, since the doctors have told you there is nothing they can do to save you. imagine you are two years old. this boy exists, and he lives in iraq, the child of a sunni family whose hospital had been taken over by shiite militia. on the other side of the world, in boston, someone hears of this, a wealthy, 85 year old liquor tycoon whose own son died of an incurable form of cancer. the world is shrinking. the elderly fellow from boston pays for the young boy's family to fly to jordan where there is a very dim hope of treatment with the tumor so far advanced. the doctors in jordan do not know what will happen, but it is the only hope. it is not a miracle what happens next . a miracle would be something that defies all explanation. i don't yet believe that acts of human kindness defy all explanation. ----- the pursuit of athletic excellence is an ideal, just like the pursuit of global peace. they may both be fleeting things sometimes, but that doesn't mean they don't occasionally exist, even if only in very small batches. for just a few moments, when michael phelps breaks another world record, for a fleeting moment he is the pinnacle of athletic excellence. for just a few moments, when a young iraqi boy walks out of a hospital in jordan after treatment paid for by a elderly man in boston, they are world peace. the world is shrinking. and it is not a bad thing. aaaaand we're back. so as of today i am 30 years old. things couldn't be better. i've written before about what i think the advantages to getting older are and i still stand by those things. bill watterson once suggested that people who remember childhood as an idyllic time were probably never children, and that's a statement i agree with. it's not like being a kid was bad (it wasn't), but it's a pretty amazing (and sometimes scary) thing to have a modicum of control over your life. i also maintain it is awesome to be able to have the authority to scold those younger than you are. age is the type of completely arbitrary authority that just increases with every passing day. just this morning i pulled into the parking garage at work and there was a young fellow blasting music out of his car. just the fact that i could legitimately think to myself: "that young punk, what's he doing playing music at that volume this early in the morning" and actually have a small part of that thought be automatically accurate (the part about him being "young" compared to me, not necessarily the part about being a punk, he's probably a real swell kid, i mean after all he is arriving at work at 7:30 am just like i am, probably during his summer vacation) is the type of thing that i find internally amusing enough to keep me in a good mood. so, where have i been these past several months? well, i haven't been doing anything particularly epic. since getting married, jules had been busy studying for the delaware bar exam (a 3 day test which she finished taking last week, results in october) and i've been doing... whatever it is that i do. and frankly that's what i like doing. there was a time in the heady days of my youth (you know, like 8 years ago) where i would have been terrified of the notion of working a 35-40 hour a week job, settling in to some kind of routine. now it's really what i enjoy most. some of my best times are just relaxing at home talking to jules, reading a book or watching baseball on the tube together. i'm a much more boring guy than i used to be, but i consider that to be a good thing. so why haven't i been updating the blog then? what's the excuse? well, there really isn't any. but i've been thinking during all those months i haven't been writing about what this blog is exactly. is it a journal? is it a blog about games? shouldn't it have a theme of some kind? and i've kind of decided that there are enough blogs out there that spend their time discussing games, and enough blogs out there that are just journals. there are enough blogs out there that complain and mock various things, and really i'm not as good at any of that stuff as they are. so as of today, i'm going to try something new with the blog. i'm going to go for a general theme of optimism. a general theme that says "life can be pretty cool." that may still involve games that i think are fun and self-deprecating personal anecdotes and some of the other random stuff i throw up here... but the gist will be the type of kerfuffle that puts a smile on my face. we'll see, maybe it will put a smile on yours. and if you got this far, thanks for not unsubscribing from this thing. i'm starting to see the following expression used more and more in various publications these days, particularly by journalists: searching for x on google produces y results in z seconds. if you haven't seen this before, let me give you a couple of examples: from law.com : online virtual worlds are wildly popular, attracting millions of people every day, and a recent google search for mmorpg yielded approximately 32 million results. from the toronto star : partner new blue jay shortstop david eckstein and the word "scrappy" and a google search will advise you of some 5,300 possibilities. in just 0.38 seconds, too. from jose canseco's new steroid book, vindicated : put in 'alex rodriguez' and 'infidelity' and you'll get like fifty thousand hits. the gist i guess is that there is supposed to be some correlation between x and y . people, please stop this madness. maybe you think it's a cute gimmick and a nice alternative to the old stock " meriam webster defines 'infedility' as... " type of intro, but all it does is expose you as a complete idiot. for the love of god, there is no correlation between x and y . it's a firk ding blasting search engine, it goes and gets as many results as it can. allow me to demonstrate via the following examples of my own. if there was any question that more dinosaurs are wearing pink hats now than ever before, just pair "pink hat" with "dinosaur" in a google search. you'll get 635,000 results in 0.17 seconds. i always thought bananas were funny looking, like they're from another planet. you might be surprised to hear that a google search of "aliens plant bananas" yields 526,000 results in 0.29 seconds. bananas may be the proof we need that we are not alone. recycling for the planet is one thing, but what about recycling what our own body produces for ourselves? a quick google search of "lose weight by drinking raw sewage" gives you 153,000 results in just 0.32 seconds. it's obviously an idea worth considering. to writers everywhere, i am begging you this last time to please stop this insanity, or so help me i will google "[your name here] is completely brain dead", thus proving forever that somebody needs to pull your plug. 
Male: 100%, Male,  ruches - beehives originally uploaded by parisdelhi reconciling life in togo and life in the us hasn't been fun. contrary to what one would think given how the whole world is trying to train africa out of its supposed backwardness, i have more or less come to the conclusion that the culture, eating habits, amount of physical activity, societal structure and the general way of life of my village in togo are much healthier than those of the us. in the us we have plenty of money but we no longer know how to live, for the most part we are unhealthy and lost in modern life, and what is worse is that the rest of the world is trying to copy us. in togo, for the most part people know how to live well. the only thing that is missing is a bit more money. that is where beekeeping becomes useful... one could very well argue that in the end money will manage to strip africa of its knowledge of how to live well. in that case money is the culprit. pitching in originally uploaded by parisdelhi to conclude tv or radio news stories about climate change and the declining livability of the planet, the same message is often repeated: that scientists agree that recycling and more efficient cars and equipment will not suffice to greatly improve the prospects of maintaining a highly livable planet and avoiding the worst consequences of climate change. what is truly needed to improve our chances, scientists conclude, is for humans to fundamentally change their behavior. while listening to international dialog about the human-planet relationship, i hear talk of more efficient power plants and more recycling centers, that help us to comsume more with less or allow us to pollute less or as much while consuming more, i don't hear much serious talk about the scientific community approved idea of societal behavior change or cultural change. in very many ways, i find village life with its hard work, basic foods, and rudimentary entertainment, to be much more healthy than life in the modern desire-driven world. i am fully aware that clean water, good sources of nutrition, and health care are necessary, but how much more than that is necessary? and to what extent does having more than that actually have a negative impact on our mental and physical health, and on the health of our surrounding world? it is my belief that we spend much more money and resources solving problems created by modernity's attempt to satisfy desires than we spend solving the problem of fundmental needs. finding fulfillment in the satisfaction of those fundamental needs and foregoing our 24/7 all you can eat "desire saticiety," is a road that interests me. what does humanity want? health, happiness, and the fulfillment of fundamental needs or the fulfillment of unending fleeting desires, less happiness, and declining human and environmental health? i'll end with a quote from thomas merton: "no man can serve two masters. your life is shaped by the end you live for. you are made in the image of what you desire." humanity must decide what it wants and then make a conscious effort to pursue what it wants even if that entails modifying very dear cultural behaviors... dsc01635 originally uploaded by parisdelhi while i was in togo i had many personal debates taking place and some of them made their way onto this blog. some debates encouraged external help coming to africa and others would seem to discourage external aid. i am happy that i had all of those debates because they allowed me to explore international development, africa, social change, and more, but i want to make clear that there is a place, a lot of places, for well conceived external help that responds to real needs. i will do my best to meet a few of those needs on a small scale where i can be competent. in the photo you see a young veterinary technician in his rural pharmacy. dsc01631 originally uploaded by parisdelhi coming back to the us can be damn hard. once you are in the states, some wonderful feelings are felt but, no doubt, with the lack understanding ears, one can certainly become mildly and temporarily depressed. finding the cultural continuity that i described in an earlier entry can be very helpful to recent returned peace corps volunteers (rpcvs), but in the interest of fellow rpcvs i would mention the possibility of collaborating to launch a small project back in your peace corps country. as we know, one must have some very effective ways to insure correct use of funds but with strong contacts on the ground and in our world of cell phones and western union, i have found that possible. designing and providing funds for a small beekeeping project has given me the opportunity to do something meaningful. i planned this project with two fellow community members from my togolese village and did not launch it to keep my emotions up. i helped plan it because i believed in it. i believe that this project will be effective, and that it will not create dependence, given the way we designed it. because i believe so strongly in the effectiveness of the project and that i am doing the right thing in implementing it, it has given me a mission when my overseas peace corps mission has just officially ended. this project has also made me feel present in my togolese community and happy to still be a member of that community and an active participant in its welfare. i may no longer be a peace corps volunteer but i am still and will always be an affem boussou community member. dsc_0046-2.jpg originally uploaded by jctownsley i just heard cornel west say "fetishism of commodities." he said "it is also among the destitute because the destitute have a fetishism of commodities, a fetishism of success [and think] 'all i need is success, and then somehow i am a better person.'" i think it is hard for togolese to escape the "fetishism of commodities" as they peer out into the world through tvs and radios and i think it is very connected to what the ugandan farmer said in my last entry. he said "they shared a lot of things together...but now things have changed. each person is on their own. a few people who have acquired material wealth are very scared of sliding back into poverty. they do not want to look like us." it is hard to not be a commodity fetisher in togo as you learn of the rest of the world. and i believe the young generation will be heavily influenced by commodity fetishism but i also saw a lot of spiritually learned muslims in togo refuse commodity fetishism by emphasizing how fleeting and ephemeral earthly life is and how useless that makes attachment to money and things. a nomadic herder, himself a muslim, asked me, as i handed him money for taking me and my friends out in the bush with his cows, "do you think the prize is down here [on earth] kabirou? forget about the money." that came from a man that can live on 20 dollars a month and to whom i was handing 30 dollars. his photo accompanies this entry. i have seen less of that mysticism and refusal of worldly goods in the christian areas of togo, but i spent less time there. it is hard for togolese to escape the "fetishism of commodities," in the the commodity fetisher gala that is our world. that is sometimes hard to deal with as a peace corps volunteer who may have been able to join the peace corps in part because you have rejected commodity fetishism. you find that you and the togolese are going in opposite directions, them toward and you away from commodities... the following two points of view get at a very sociological and anthropological aspect of "development": how have western fueled development and westward emigration affected home-grown development in africa? togo led me to ponder this question more and more as time went by. "poverty has always been with us in our communities. it was here in the past, long before the europeans came, and it affected many - perhaps all of us. but it was a different type of poverty. people were not helpless. they acted together and they never allowed it to squeeze any member of the community. they shared a lot of things together: hunting, grazing animals, harvesting. there was enough for basic survival. but now things have changed. each person is on their own. a few people who have acquired material wealth are very scared of sliding back into poverty. they do not want to look like us." - ugandan farmer cited in voices of the poor, by deepa narayan; oxford university press: 2000. on a very similar note, in a 2006 article entitled "open the blinds", now rpcv dan mueller tells us of a fictional african village that was developing at its own pace before the world started trying to develop africa. it would seem that mueller is saying that organic grassroots development is made impossible or improbable by the promise of the developed world driving up in a 4 x 4 and magically developing the village with money. that prospect drastically changes the rules of the game of getting ahead and tears apart the fabric of the developing society. mueller continues, saying that the prospect of emigrating to the "developed" rich world and living the good life blinds africans and leads them to forget the organic development that their ancestors, like ancestors all over the world, were engaged in. mueller sees this state of affairs as being quite obvious to the observant development worker. eid al-adha in village life back in the us has offered me two satisfying moments of craved togolese and muslim cultural continuity. the first moment was meeting two togolese men who are originally from the area of togo where i lived. they speak the language of kotokoli that i learned to an intermediate level while in togo. speaking kotokoli, with all of the cultural importance that is placed on certain subject matters and moments in communication, renders unto the last two and a half years of my life the feeling of richness that memories of those years deserve. richness that, with no fault to anyone, dissipates like fog in the us context. the second moment of cultural continuity came when i went to friday prayer at a mosque here in oregon. there were small differences, none of the muslim rosaries that were ubiquitous in togolese mosques, folks were middle eastern and eastern european instead of african, and the sermon, that spoke to god's view on interest or making money off money, made reference to the western cultural context of being muslim in the us, to the credit crisis, plato, and the catholic church. not only did i agree with the sermon's message, that we must refuse to make money our first priority, but, as speaking kotokoli did, the sermon and the prayer that followed rendered the memory of life in togo full and rich. living in the us, it is easy for my life in togo to be drained of its meaning and utility like a motor of its oil. moments of cultural continuity put oil back in my motor. a poster of barack sold in togolese markets originally uploaded by parisdelhi the morning following the election of barack obama, i heard two themes in the reactions of togolese: 1) this election is a lesson in meritocratic democracy and social equality. 2) this election represents the official removal of the glass ceiling that many assumed would always differentiate the place of blacks and the place of whites in the world. the election certainly proved everything that i had said to togolese about my experience of america and about what i believed that america was. it was very nice to walk around an american in africa for that reason and for the reason that my country had just accomplished the feat of making an expression of love and humanity be heard unmuffled. i was proud. i was disappointed, however, that many assumed that i would vote for john mccain but i understand that assumption. while giving a class in a togolese middle school on the us election process and on the 2008 campaign, i asked the students who they would vote for. they responded that they would vote for obama. i asked them why and they caught themselves and we laughed as they scurried to find policy reasons for voting obama. when asked who i would vote for, i joked with the students that "of course i would vote for john mccain given my race." they understood that i was making the point that race or ethnicity should not determine who one votes for and we had another good laugh. 
Male: 100%, Female,  activists help put an end to gross negligence and primate deaths at a university lab . it's amazing to me that most universities, even seemingly progressive ones like uc berkeley, conduct useless experiments on animals. legendary "humanzee" oliver, his friends, and the bitter fight over animal welfare at a texas refuge . "meps jens holm, caroline lucas, sajjad karim, and robert evans are today calling on other meps to back a landmark call to make plans for an end to the use of chimpanzees and monkeys in experiments across the european union (eu) . the call comes at a point when almost 50 meps have signed a declaration before the european parliament to end primate research across the eu in the next six years." let's hope the u.s. wakes up and follows europe's lead. i find it very sad that we as a nation aren't leading this fight for compassionate science. new iberia research center (nirc) has the most captive primates in the world, and is affiliated with the university of louisiana at lafayette. a former employee revealed disturbing allegations of animal cruelty that prompted an investigation and lawsuit , and another group that analyzed reports requested from the university (as is our right under the freedom of information act) found disturbing signs of abuse and neglect relating to a group of rhesus monkeys . nirc has also conducted maternal deprivation experiments , what i consider to be one of the more cruel, useless, abominable "research" activities. write to thomas j. rowell, the veterinarian in charge, and request that the aging chimpanzees under his care be released to a sanctuary. these animals will not be forgotten. thomas j. rowell, dvm new iberia research center university of louisiana at lafayette 4401 w. admiral doyle drive new iberia, la 70560 karen - age 48 billy ray - age 47 clay - age 46 diana - age 46 jan - age 46 julius - age 46 lady bird - age 46 pumpkin - age 46 sandy - age 46 walter b. - age 46 for example, primarily primates, inc. , which housed several retired research chimps, is apparently a pit of despair. also, facilities that receive federal funding such as chimp haven must return animals to laboratories if they are requested to. in my book, that's not really retirement. project r&r; has a list of sanctuaries that can take animals , and notes which have received funding, and i assume approval, from them. personally, after watching chimpanzees: an unnatural history on pbs and getting to "know" gloria grow , i think the fauna sanctuary is truly a place that's earned it's name. most americans think that chimpanzees who have spent more than 10 years in research deserve to be retired : seventy-one percent of us, in fact. despite this, nearly 90 percent of lab chimps have been used for more than 10 years. jane goodall's pioneering research has opened a window into the private lives of chimps. to read how similiar they are to humans, visit jgi's chimpanzee central . "once we admit that we are not the only beings with personality, reasoned thought, and above all, the ability to feel and express emotions such as joy, despair and empathy, then we develop a new respect for chimpanzees. the line between human and other non-human beings, once thought so sharp, becomes blurred. this forces us to a new respect also for the other amazing animal beings with whom we share the planet. " from the wisconsin state journal : "a dane county judge said monday that the law is on the side of animal-rights activists who want to buy buildings next to the uw-madison's primate labs and open a museum highlighting the cruelty they say happens at the labs." 
Female: 100%, Female,  this has a nice homer simpson vibe to it. and let's face it, who else could qualify as the original airhead better? my mental age just hit somewhere where it can only be defined as 'very old, bordering on senility and that stage when the fridge seems like the optimal spot for any sort of keys, the husband's deodorant, and mitzy, the little hand-bag size poodle'.&nbsp;or perhaps i finally bore witness to that thing called a blond moment , made so famous by jessica simpson of the notorious chicken of the sea fame. or was it marilyn monroe (oh no! am i having another one? of those moments . or was it that monroe was just having more fun...? nngh! she does look like she was having oodles of fun in her hayday, but then again she did kill herself, so i don't quite know what that does to the whole having more fun than brunettes or redheads, and... what was i saying? am i still writing an aside in the parentheses? shit.) what? shit. oh yes. i was writing about my interesting discussion at the gas station today. in case that wasn't completely obvious from the marilyn monroe references. nothing says gas like marilyn, right? "please fill it up," i say, and the man smiles at me through my open window. there are the usual questions on the water and oil and something i think sounds like 'carlage' but which i haven't actually told them to check yet, not even to find out what carlage might mean, when i hear the gas pump click. "hmm, that's awfully soon," i mumble to myself and frown in what i always believe is an endearing manner, but might just be scaring the bejeezus out of the attendant, as i'm pretty sure i can see his lip quiver just a little when he approaches me again. "52 rand," the man tells me. "what? that's not possible! i had less than half a tank left! how much did you put in?" i open with, but decide to make things easier for myself as him telling me 5 liters or 50 is not going to mean anything to me anyway, "wait, scratch that. did you fill it allllll the way up?" i make a sign that to me signifies full, but probably means that i would like to hitch a ride to baragwanath hospital on one of the local taxis. which i probably should not do. or that's at least what every single person i've told about my two taxi-rides in soweto says as they look at me like i'm insane. "yes ma'am, allllll the way up" says the attendant and makes a sign that might mean that he too is in need of some sort of transportation. i start the car and watch the gauge that doesn't move at all. "see!" i yell and point at the dashboard, "there's something wrong!" "madam, that's the temperature gauge." now, where to find a new gas station i can start frequenting? looks sufficiently medicinal, but is in fact taken at a vineyard. you might not know this, or may not have guessed it since i've been told more than once that it isn't exactly a thing i radiate and would possibly even sneer at, apparently because of my cynical ,&nbsp; professional and rational-seeming exterior... i fokken know. i mean, really? what in the name of platonically frolicking unicorns would give anyone this idea?!?! see, right there, i just had to scream because it was sort of warranted. the whole thing's just that utterly confounding to me. utterly. ...but i am a strong believer in the power of alternative medicine, the role of nutrition, vitamins, and such other like things, when it comes to staying healthy or being cured. so i pop a lot of pills of the supplement variety. i drink a lot of wheatgrass juice. in the mornings i like to brew liqorice-root and cinnamon infused green tea to be sipped (and to hopefully cancel out some of the negative effects) right alongside my several cups of morning coffee. i eat a lot of broccoli and spinach. i chew on flax seeds. i drink incredible amounts of water. i buy organic. somehow, almost without noticing it myself, i seem to have become one of those people. those annoying people who show up at a dinner and won't eat half of the things on their plate because they either contain sugar, white flour, starch, dairy, or something passing itself as fruit but which is closer to a lump of sugar, just not as refined. those irritating people who can comfortably talk about the benefits of vitex agnus castus as a dietary supplement for at least a good 20 minutes, and don't even get them started on superfoods. those boring people who swear by a green concoction of wheatgrass, spinach, cucumber, avocado, and some alfalfa as the best snack ever. those frightening people whose pee is always neon yellow from excess vitamin c and completely discussible with anyone, odor included. one of them . which i thought was a mainstream movement and i was just a little slow at catching on. yes? aren't we all pretty much those people by now? at least mostly. surely we're all on the 2010-version wagon of 'you are what you eat'? we all understand and respect the awesome power of traditional medicine, but don't sneer at new, or sometimes 'ancient', developments in the form of uses of medicinal plants, acupuncture, patient-specific treatments, yada yada and all that jazz, right? turns out, nope. for quite some time i have been managing my condition that involves a severe hormonal imbalance among other wondrous medical phenomena, without taking one pill of the drug variety. (okay, so in the last year truly managing, prior to that just refusing to take the drugs and sometimes suffering quite a load of consequences. i admit. i like wine, burgers and coffee. so sue me, oh body of mine.) when i was diagnosed in denmark more than five years ago, it was the doctor who pointed me to a site on the internet with more information about a necessary diet, the necessary supplements, the correct kind of exercise, and other such hoopla. the website was pink in color, but it was doctor recommended, so i read it and have now finally followed. without a need for any kind of drugs. well, coffee and wine of course, but they are more in the 'necessity for ultimate survival of the human race' category anyway. however, here in south africa, it seems that those people don't quite exist yet, and that medical 'developments' are running a vastly different course, if not a whole different race. "either you manage your condition with medicine or you suffer and live with the consequences," the doctor, a prominent gynecologist and an elderly man, says, looks at me and sneers. "but i haven't actually had any 'consequences' in the year i've been managing it with natural products and diet," i respond. and, as much as i hate to admit it, i do the air quotes. yup. i do. "well, that's all pure nonsense," the doc blurts out, "show me one [fancy word i don't know what means] placebo [other fancy word i don't know what means, the flippen a-hole] study out there." the doctor laughs and i stare at him. "just because there aren't studies out there doesn't mean the products and diet do not work. there aren't any studies out there showing they don't work either," is what i should have said, but instead i just stare. also, the ultrasound device inside me is throwing off my 'tude mojo some serious. and the doctor just laughs. and then he laughs again when i tell him i refuse to go back on the medicine because of the side effects, since according to him there aren't any. the asshole. there i go, screaming again. maybe it's the 'consequences'. growing up finnish, mainly in finland, guaranteed a few things. 1) someone, at some point of my fragile youth (i'm thinking the big mean high school sports coach, and yes, i too was fragile at one point in my life. was too!) made sure i learned how to ski. cross country. fast. even if i was wailing like a lunatic while frog-legging it up a steep hill with my increasingly slippery skis on. but finns must all know how to ski. yes they do. and&nbsp;i still hate skiing like the plague. only worse. 2) i didn't have to learn how to hug, compliment, or express any kind of affection through any other means than slightly raising my left eyebrow and grunting softly. or by emptying the dishwasher. or vacuuming my own room without being yelled at. or making a full pot of coffee instead of just two cups for myself. or not telling my best friend she looked like crap even if she totally did (pigtails never look good. no they don't). i learned to love the finnish way. except for skiing. that i learned to hate. like hundreds of thousands of other finns before and after me. why am i talking about skiing and affection? together? why? why would i combine possibly the worst memories i have of finland and being finnish with love? ah well. i'm not completely there. or here. yet. the lights are on, but the lady's still under the covers. this past week saw me return to finland at a time i normally avoid. i was supposed to be landing in the warmth of cairo, but instead, at the airport, which incidentally instead of cairo was in the freezing north also known as helsinki, around midnight, i was met with -17 degrees celsius and my tired brother. my grandma suddenly passed away and my family needed me. which was a first, because we finns don't tend to need other people, or at least we won't say so. as it turns out, they really did need me. they needed the one person in the family who has learned to hold hands with anyone else than their significant other (mine taught me that!), to hug, to console with words that are in no way masqueraded as grunts, to go beyond household chores as far as displays of affection go, and to laugh through tears and not be terribly embarrassed by it. but that was only to get the ball rolling. for the first time in my life i hugged my grandpa. and he hugged me back. i held his hand. i consoled him. i talked with him about grandma, about africa, about traveling, about getting a good fire going, about my childhood, and about the life from now on. and then i talked with my mother. i held her hand. i hugged her. i consoled her. and she hugged me back. and we talked. last week, i learned the true depth of the love, i had sometimes doubted even really existed, between my grandpa and my grandma. i learned about the way my grandpa would, whenever my grandma wasn't there, literally count the hours to her return. i learned about his desperation at her open casket. i learned about the completely missing 'i' in everything he's ever done. i learned about how finns, and by that i mean finns because that's what my war-veteran grandpa is to the core, can love too, really love to a point where it takes your breath away. i learned that perhaps i'm not so special after all, with my fancy hand-holding, foreign hugging, and the continuous 'i love you's. i learned that underneath that uncomfortable and repressed seeming eyebrow wiggling and vacuuming instead of talking, there are some serious and deep emotions coming out of finland too. some serious love. with all that enforced skiing, who would have guessed? &nbsp; &nbsp; how to handle this? how to talk about this? my grandmother on my mother's side passed away on monday afternoon. she wasn't very old and she wasn't very sick. she had a heart attack putting away groceries while my grandfather was getting firewood from the shed. she wasn't breathing when my grandfather found her and there was nothing the paramedics could do to bring her back. she was gone. she is gone. her last word was 'coffee'. she was going to make some for herself and my grandpa, which is only fitting, since that's what she spent most of her life doing. there was always hot coffee. or at least the thought of making some and then drinking some. always coffee. for everyone. imagine her horror when she found out that my viking didn't drink coffee. the first few times she simply ignored the exotic ways of this weirdo foreigner and poured some in his cup anyway, but once she found out that instead of the viking it was i who was secretly downing the manna in his cup in addition to my own, she solemnly ordered him to "at least drink milk, boy". loudly. and in finnish. i think that's when the viking (after a sugarcoated translation from me) finally understood what it meant for me to say that i loved him "even more than coffee." in not so many days i'll be in finland, sitting in my mother's kitchen, drinking copious amounts of finnish coffee, and talking about my grandmother. while my mother makes sure there's hot coffee in the pot. always coffee. for everyone. my grandmother will be missed. may i offer you something rotten to go with your morning coffee? warning : this here particular diatribe will include stuff about weight, losing it (weight and temper), flying, how much i love kevin smith, and other assorted controversial things (maybe. depends on what the maid decides to do with the wineglasses she's supposedly washing). so, if you're tired of the whole swa humiliating innocent kevin smith debacle ( something along the lines of this moron's view ) go away and come back when i return to inadvertently trying to kill the guards at my gate (i would never, but they insist on hopping in front of the car at the weirdest places) or just to my general doing nothing and then some more nothing, and shoes. because, today, i have been thinking. pondrin somthin serious. in the last couple of days i have been following kevin smith 's (who really, truly is some kind of a god-like force within comedy, if you disregard certain extremely carnal and perhaps even unnecessary tweets about him boning his wife, and i will disregard them and love him nonetheless) experience with flying on, or at least trying to, southwest airlines. how he got booted off of the flight that he had already been seated on (with the armrests down and not 'spilling' onto his fellow passengers) because he had gotten on that flight as a standby and had actually, for reasons relating to his own comfort on the flight and because he's probably fairly wealthy seeing as he's a really successful funnyman (how do i love clerks and mallrats? let me count the ways.), bought two seats for the later flight he had originally selected. thus apparently officially 'admitting' that he was fat, in fact too fat to fly in one seat. now, if you have been following this blog for a while you all know how i feel about flying , how much my derriere detests even the mention of it , how my thighs protest violently every time even the thought of travel pops into my head , and how badly my brain wants to grow to the level where i can invent an easier way of moving from one place to another - a teleportation device if you will, or even a harry potter-ish fireplace of travel, just without house elves, thank you very much - without having to subject any part of me to the experience that is check-in, airport security, boarding, other people's 'hand luggage', flight, in-flight 'entertainment', stewardesses (especially the ones i seem to encounter. hello air france!), airplane seats, airplane bathrooms, other frikken passengers, customs, and having my luggage mangled and/or efficiently spirited away (always to london, it seems). i consider having to fly anywhere a punishment of epic proportions. mainly due to the extreme discomfort of airplanes for anyone who isn't 5'4 and weigh at the most 100 lbs. because, naturally, airlines want to make as much money as they can, and thus squeeze as many of us as possible into the smallest space possible. regardless of whether or not we really fit. comfort and friendly skies my ass. torture and bitchiness is much closer to the truth. i hate the journey. i do. also, if you indeed have been following this blog for a while, you would know that i've never been a small specimen of a woman. expressions such as east-german shot-putter, amazon, and perhaps even grand dame (no, sorry, that was to do with champagne i think, but what the hell, i like it) have come up. but what you don't know, unless you know how to decipher my cryptic hints, is that today i'm perhaps 50 lbs lighter than i was when i last had to make a plane trip longer than 2 hrs. still, i'm a fat woman. i'll always, always be a fat woman. regardless of how i look on the outside. and will never think there is anything wrong with being a fat woman. or a fat man even (still, i think i'm going to stay a woman. i like my boobies too much to exchange them for just one overly dangly piece of anything). weight loss has never been a goal for me, nor will it ever be. i strongly disagree with what normally passes as equal to healthy, and what kind of appearance almost automatically gets labeled as unhealthy, slovenly, lazy, undesirable, ugly, or second rate. my recent change has come about as a side effect to some changes (such as saying no to most fruit, traditionally considered an unhealthy decision) that have been quite necessary, and due to a genetic condition i have, in order for me to not need medicine that shouldn't be mixed with alcohol (and i seriously do want to keep drinking the wine, if in smaller amounts than before), for the sake of my poor liver, and to save poor veg from her siamese-sister contractual obligation to give me a piece of hers when mine finally conks out. so i feel for kevin smith. and i whole-heartedly support him. awesome of him to use his fame, regardless of how humiliating the situation must have been for him, and bring some much needed attention to this kind of treatment received by all of us overweight peeps often enough world over. in all kinds of situations. more often than one would think. because, discrimination based on one's weight is unwarranted for. this kind of discrimination, like is in the case of smokers, could only be tolerated if overweight actually directly also spelled harm to others, and/or costs to others. which it doesn't. it's often said that it does, but the truth is that it doesn't. it just doesn't. sure, there are many extremely unhealthy people who are sure to end up having [insert a costly medical procedure right here] before they are 40 years old who are also overweight, but it just isn't that overweight which makes it so. that overweight is just a symptom. then there are many extremely healthy people who will live to be a nice 104 (and might in doing so end up costing quite a few bucks to society as well, i might add) who are overweight. there are many extremely unhealthy people who are sure to end up having [insert a costly medical procedure right here] before they are 40 years old who are 'normal' (who tell hell decided what was normal anyway?) weight. and so on. case by case. all people are individuals, and the beauty (and the curse) of statistics is that you can have them display for you exactly what you want. that's why the media loves statistics. they sound official enough to back up a report about a 'fat epidemic' and can easily be made to play into that end. and a fat epidemic just hits so much closer to home than an actual epidemic still sweeping the world: the aids epidemic. i don't need to remind anyone how many people die of aids in sub-saharan africa every single day do i? there's no way this number isn't plastered on every single front page all the time. what? it isn't? well, shit! i guess the 4100 people a day who die of aids in sub-saharan africa are a drop in the ocean compared to the thousands and thousands of people who succumb to the evil, evil epidemic of having a bmi over 25 every single day. &nbsp;i guess it's the 6 in the 26 that wraps around their hearts and slowly suffocates them. must be. fat does not automatically equal unhealthy. nor does thin equal healthy. in my part of africa fat can also equal wealthy, beautiful, handsome, healthy, and happy. it's all cultural. it really is. and while we have, hopefully (although evidence to the contrary seems to be surfacing around me constantly) stopped categorizing and judging people based on the color of their skin or their gender, weight remains the last frontier of 'accepted discrimination'. and who is it that is making it so? well, us. you guys, we suck. why are we so fokken dumb? one last thing in the way of warning : should you feel you disagree with me on this one and feel the need to tell me so in a comment or in an email, i will immediately think less of you. i will consider such a response equal to you telling me you loved the twilight saga and didn't see anything wrong with how it portrays women and girls, or how you identify with the characters in marian keyes novels. i will think much less of you, your intellect, and your ability for compassion. much, much less. &nbsp; lately, since i've been leaving the house almost every single day - albeit mainly to buy shoes (thank you zeus for stave madden), but also to work on all sorts of exciting projects with just a pinch of introducing some honest american english to unsuspecting souls in a (whoa!) classroom situation (it gets better...) with moi actually in charge (when you say it all together like that the result is quite scary and unpalatable, i know) - i've again been subjected to one of the things i don't particularly miss from my life in mexico city (yes i do! i miss it all!), but that very likely accounted for quite a few months out of the couple year span. yup. traffic. trafico . i have such fond memories of inching down reforma, one of the main arteries of mexico city, for hours on end in my burgundy shoebox of a chevy with zero air conditioning. wearing exhaust fumes like a fine perfume. buying all of my cleaning products at intersections. chatting to beggars in broken español . singing along to the songs on that weird mariachi radio station without actually knowing the words (cept for cielito lindo . everyone knows cielito lindo . besides it's just a whole lot of ay ay ay ay and then some more ay ay ay ). watching my suction cup jesus gently sway in the furiously circulating lukewarm air. and believe it or not, sometimes playing sudoku. honest. and here i am again, stuck in traffic. granted, regardless of still conforming to the universally accepted definition of traffic (as opposed to the finnish definition which can be loosely understood as: "shit. there's someone else on the road at the same time as me! holy cow! i must watch out now."), the traffic here in jozi is nowhere near the kind of sea of ebbing and flowing waves of chaos associated with mexico city. still, it's something you sit in for longer than you had initially intended or hoped. until you run out of boogers to fish out of your nose, and that weird, red something between your teeth that looks like tomato peel although you can't remember when you last had anything with tomato in it just does not enthrall you like it did a minute ago. but traffic's different here. simply not slow enough to play sudoku, put on makeup, tweeze my eyebrows (i don't really, just putting it out there as a potential), work out what the hell that black stuff underneath my nail is and why can't i wash it off, come up with seven different ways of wearing my faux-hawk with the help of multiple mirrors available in my car, or make up stories of people who have those stupid 'baby on board' suction-cup thingies on the rear window in which (the stories that is) they always have dark family secrets or possibly an extra toe/finger/other magnificent appendage (never claimed to have a normal imagination). too fast for anything but radio. thus, i'm actually finally coming to my point. yes, there fokken was one all along. there really was! (well, okay. maybe not a point, but more of a theme. a unifying factor. yes.) &nbsp; and my point is a series of questions to you people: how loud is it acceptable to sing along to 50 cent's baby by me? does 'doing that weird vogue movement' with your head make any difference? is baby by me the new baby got back? how frikken awesome is p!nk? why don't more people sing loudly in their cars? what is it called when you kind of dance along behind the steering wheel? what do you do to kill time in traffic? i know. i do. i blame the mother-in-law. maybe you should too. whilst i was wildly careening around southern africa, expertly &nbsp;dodging (ahem! yes. you have to own your strengths and avoidance of things is what i do best.) my mother-in-law's sneaky attempts at... what? i'm not sure, but she was definitely up to something sneaky and evil-ish, who knows with her? to wean me off her precious eldest so that he can find a nice danish girl? to magically make me forget about contraception (and actually suddenly gain the ability to reproduce) and populate the earth with tiny ginger-haired half-vikings for her to clothe and give hard candy to? to make me eat a sugary dessert? to feed me to the lions? to ... what was i saying? oh yes. whilst i was romping around my part of this continent with my spirit safely stowed away in the upstairs shower, and taking crap from a certain someone without once raising a finger and only sometimes an eyebrow and only rolling my eyes and sighing when she couldn't see or hear, something wonderful happened. somehow, at some office of the infamous south african postal service someone decided to deliver two (i know. two! i can't get over the number, which usually is more like 0, the remains of 1, "ma'am, there is no delivery for you", 1/3, "are you accusing us of theft ma'am?" or less than 0) packages to me. two!!! (i know i already said it, but two is almost unheard of. a mythical number postal delivery-wise. possibly a sign that somewhere up there, an angel finally has his wings. or a pig flies. or a baby unicorn frolics. or hitler's learning to snowboard, way way below up there and everyone else in the bad man's case, of course.) it is as if the universe knew who was visiting me. and wanted to stop me just shy of a violent act. by making me remember how wonderful a place this world of the interwebz can actually be. and how well my bloggy pals really do know me. i present to you in order of arrival: a thing of pure beauty and ingenuity that really truly encompasses a good deal of my personality. something to do with golf and then again, something to do with my blatant inability to golf. a way to become better without actually doing anything really taxing about it. i've always thought voodoo might very well be the answer to most of my problems. or at least a more exciting way of ignoring them and not dealing with them than your most garden-variety means of procrastination. a golf voodoo kit from my beloved siamese sister (who lets me ignore her just as i do my biological family) veg of the (mis)adventures of veg . go read her! she is very much like a canadian me . except that instead of drinking wine, she recycles. followed by a mere day by another thing of pure beauty and ingenuity that really truly encompasses a good deal of my personality. something to do with coffee. well, actually the precious infant born to arabica and light roast: starbucks. which i love only slightly less than the viking. a starbucks christmas ornament and a card made by the sender herself from my dear, dear friend and part-finn erin of my camera and the gentle giant . go check out her wonderful photos , learn about her life , or at least go check out something very close to her heart: autismspeaks.org thank you universe for people who love me and remember me. even when my spirit's in storage. love you right back people! not you, mother-in-law . so. mother-in-laws. they, and you (by which i actually mean me me me me me!!!), are better off in their own little corners of the world. or at least that's my immediate experience. a hypothesis now firmly grounded in the severity of reality and made into an iron-clad fact. this here = my corner, that one over there far, far away = the mil's niche. and we all can live happily ever after, like tradition, and disney and each and every 80s teen movie, promise. and that molly ringwald, she wouldn't lie, would she? so, please bugger off dear mama and let me have my prince already! the viking's mine and no matter what you do, there is no way you will ever be able to shove him back up there. you know, up to denmark, in case some of you were thinking i meant the uterus, which i did initially, but then i just decided to discard that image altogether lest it screw me up for good, so we'll just say denmark. the sentiment still applies. between me and her (feel free to add your own disrespectful tone here) i prefer a distance of a few continents, and at least one whole ocean if at all possible, but i have heard - although this is something i would never personally accept or recommend - that a mere 'few countries to the east' is sometimes sufficient. well. not for me. still, like they say, bad things happen to good people. and sometimes she (please amp up the disrespectful tone from before) is to be found right under one's nose. in one's spare bed. loudly criticizing one's choice of linen, innards of the fridge (so the packet of crazy glue says to keep it in the fridge!), lack of tan, and the water pressure or the magical lack of it during her (you know the drill now) showers. and all that before the discussions about the ' unpalatable food of africa' were ever even entered into. but it's time to move on, she 's (i know you know what to do...) gone. it's time to be generally glad that no one threw a punch or drew actual blood, intentionally or unintentionally, that doors have locks, that a car can drive you far, far away, that there was a fair amount of laughter, be it fake, distraught, to mask the tears or actual, that lions were being cooperative and not hiding in the bushes, giving everyone a welcome break from the evil eyes being shot left and right (i'm sure the lions never even knew what hit them), that regardless of not-so-veiled threats absolutely no one threw the poor daughter-in-law to them in best roman style, that spar sells wine early in the morning on a tuesday, that a spot of archery and a wild imagination can relieve a pent up need to scream without any actual screaming, that world has coffee and alcohol and coffee-flavored alcohol in it, and that the viking knows to take my (and only my) side. and that my father-in law (who doesn't detest me nearly as much as i thought he did) and her (yada yada blah blah) managed to create someone i can call my bestest friend in the whole wide world, whom i love more than life itself, and to whom i'm the center of the universe without still quite figuring out how i manage to pull that off on a daily basis. and that he is the wonderful person that he is. thankful, yet homicidal. hmm. just give me a couple of days to retrieve my spirit from the top secret storage location (okay, the upstairs, master bedroom shower, that has excellent water pressure, i might add) i've had it shoved up into, to keep it safe from harm and any potential vampiristic, i.e. hey-zeus-help-me-this-woman's-sucking-every-single-drop-of-life-force-and-other-assorted-positive-things-right-out-of-me activities. but i will be whole again. and i'm still breathing. ha!

as i warmed up with team inov-8 runner ben nephew , we agreed that the day had a lot the right ingredients for a breakthrough pr. although the temp was in the high 30's, the sun would warm up the day to ideal low 50's by the halfway point. short of some wind gusts, this was much better than snow/sleet/sub-zero caumsett 50k's of the past. plus there were a lot of great runners here - 2x defending champ and course record holder (2:56) michael wardian , scott jaime (pronounced hi-me) from colorado, 50k masters american record holder dan verrington , 24-hour american record holder mark godale , 24-hour national team member phil mccarthy, montrail runners annette bednosky and jill perry , the great scott jurek, and a half dozen more that could go sub-3:30 on a good day. i felt like a kid meeting my favorite rock stars! &nbsp; (ben nephew and i sport the new team inov-8 shirts) &nbsp; (staying warm at the start) my personal goal for the day was to improve on my 50k pr (3:37 at the 2009 ruth anderson 50k ). my speed work was going insanely well over the last three months, particularly by teaching me that i could be in a lot of pain and still hold my form. to achieve a pr, like any stretch goal, you need three things. first, you need to show up (check). i know that sounds simple, but as we all know, getting the start line healthy and ready can be tough. second, you need the opportunity, like a day of perfect weather and runners faster than you (check). third, you need to believe that it is possible to achieve something beyond your best (check, thank you speedwork). let's do this! at 8:30am, suffolk county legislator jon cooper sent off the 50k runners (30 minutes ahead of the 25k runners) and the front pack quickly spread out. wardian, jesse regnier (in his first race beyond 8 miles), and 2:19 marathoner malcolm campbell went out hard, running 5:30 min/miles. scott jaime and malcolm campbell each ran solo at a sub-6 pace a few steps back, and dan verrington, ben nephew, mark godale and i clocked 6 min./miles in the next chase pack. dan was doing most of the work in our pack, letting us know right up front that he was shooting for "3 and low teens since the 45-49 50k american record is soft at 3:17". i guess he would know - it's his record! we finished the first lap in 18 minutes. my god, this was fast. &nbsp; (mark godale, ben nephew, and dan verrington chasing scott jaime) &nbsp; &nbsp;(michael wardian and jesse raginer finish up lap #1) we got sight of the womens race on the out and back section, and front runners annette bednosky, jill perry, and yolanda flamino were sticking close to each other. last years champ and course record holder, kami semick, was not present today so it was anyone's race. they were all keeping each other in sight. &nbsp; (jill perry leads annette bednosky and yolanda flamino) ben nephew was nice enough to help pace the pack with dan, but around lap 3 (mile 9) dan picked up the pace charging the uphill grades and dropped us. mark godale fell off the pace, and ben and i speculated that he probably wasn't in peak shape thanks to daughter #3 recently arriving. we both had 3-year-olds and knew how that could crimp a training plan, but #3? fuggetaboutit. &nbsp; (scott jaime gives a thumbs up) on each subsequent lap, we molted layers of hats, gloves, sleeves, wool, etc. until we were down to our tank tops in the 45-degree air. ben continued to do the lion's share of the pacing, running with a short and powerful stride from all his snowshoeing. i was nursing a sore shoulder from a sex-related injury (best if i don't provide detail on that one, but let me recommend that you stretch out before any strenuous exercise), but otherwise feeling strong. the aid station volunteers at both stops were amazing, and we barely had to slow for whatever we needed. on lap 6 (mile 18), my body demanded a bio break and i made a absurdly efficient 20-second stop at the port-a-potty. ben wished me well, and from that point on he would be little more than a dot on the horizon. that was okay though - i knew the last third was going to be a three-night stay in the house of pain, and it felt proper to venture into that valley of darkness alone. &nbsp;(local ultrarunners not obeying the speed limit) i wasn't alone, however, since thanks to the loop format i got to see everyone. the new york ultra runners were having a great day and making the most of the early signs of spring. i exchanged atta-boys with 78-year-old sam soccoli from north babylon, ny, and the famous roy pirrung who was defying his 62-year-old age with a sub-5 hour pace. 70-old patricia delaney was also making good time, and always had a smile on. they sure breed 'em tough out here! at lap 8, i hit the marathon mark in 2:48 (almost a pr!) and fought desperately to hold my form. michael wardian gave a few words of encouragement as he lapped me, slowing but still on course record pace. at the turnaround, i could see that dan verrington had passed scott jaime, but scott was keeping him in sight. ben was still holding on strong and was about a minute ahead of me now. the womens race found yolanda flamino in front after dropping the hammer on lap 3 and gapping the other women by a good 15 minutes. annette bednosky, however, was picking up speed in one of her classic negative split finishes. &nbsp; (ben nephew keeps cranking) as i entered lap 10, my stomach knotted up, my head started spinning, and my muscles began twitching like crazy. my pace had slowed to a 7 minute mile as i walked the two aid stations to try and get more liquids in. the pain. my god, the pain! i could feel my heartbeat in the back of my eyeballs. but as the mile markers reminded me, this was almost over. annette was kind enough to pick up the pace and run along with me until the last 1/2 mile, and i gave it everything. i crossed the finish in 3:20:48, good enough for 6th overall. &nbsp;(mark godale and dan verrington talk about the race) i laughed out loud as i crossed the finish line. did that just happen? did i just take 17 minutes off my pr? either the training is going well, or i have been seriously sandbagging for a long time now. as i spoke with the other finishers, it turns out many of them had breakthrough days. michael wardian (2:55) had beat his previous record by 40 seconds, with malcolm campbell (3:04) getting second with a great performance. scott jaime (3:13) had passed dan verrington (3:15) to claim third and the masters win, but dan set a new 45-49 age group american record in the process. ben was quite pleased with his 3:18 best on this course, and mark godale charged in the last laps to finish a few minutes behind me. jesse raginer clocked a 3:28 in his first 50k - not bad at all! &nbsp;(2010 womens 50k road national champion, yolanda flamino) (scott jaime gets the masters payday from rd amy goldstein) yolanda flamino won the womens division in 3:34, with annette bednosky (3:43) taking second and winning the masters division in a time well under her goal. jill perry (3:47) fought through some tough spots to hold onto third.

"i was in bed, feeling sorry for myself, [another random number] pounds overweight, and my [body part] looked like [bad food or construction analogy] . i decided the best way to beat [near-fatal disease or accident] was to celebrate the health i had one day at a time. i trained for months and completed [major race] . i'm not embarrassed about my [body part] since it gives me a chance to educate others about [near-fatal disease or accident] . i've now hooked up with [charity of near-fatal disease or accident] to run more, and hope to inspire others with [near-fatal disease or accident] and be living proof it is possible to overcome." unfortunately it's easy to gloss over the message in these formulaic summaries. in truth, there is something very powerful at the heart of these tales. this is part ii of my long run revelations: "to lead a fulfilled life, embrace death." i've had the good fortune of losing some friends and family in the last six months. i know that sounds backwards, since the pain and loss that immediately accompanies such devastation is soul-crushing. but by embracing loss and authentically internalizing the myriad of feelings that surround it, life feels more precious. life is more precious. if we are living, we are survivors. we should all embrace life as fully as our formulaic heroes. it's such a shame that most of us can easily avoid our own finality in day-to-day routine, distracting media, and pharmacologically-enhanced lives. comfort is good, and probably necessary for some level of sanity, but it's important to regularly remind yourself not to take it all for granted. i often feel this is the reason many of us enter endurance events and push our personal limits - we surround ourselves in pain and adventure so thick that we can't escape asking ourselves the very basic questions of what makes us happy, what makes us tick, and what gives life meaning. through the pain, we grow, and for days afterward, we cherish every breath, every sunset, and every laugh. at the 2009 western states, i got so deep it got scary . but the serenity that followed lasted for weeks, even months, and was nothing short of life-changing. if 27+ hours on the trail is all it takes to reach that level of enlightenment and peace, it may very well have been the easiest thing i have ever done. embrace your finality. treasure the moments you have. see life in its fullest hue. it's the best way to honor those who left before you, and makes for much better stories. - sd [you can also read long run revelations, part i - there is no such thing as work/life balance, only life balance ] i've recently seen a large increase in traffic to this blog from blogger.com, meaning more and more bloggers are following me. great to have you! just in case it's helpful, i thought i would share a few tips picked up from analyzing traffic over the last few months. we all have different goals for blogging, and it's totally fine if you don't ever analyze your traffic or try to boost your readership. but i will say once you start looking into it, you will be surprised how many people are connecting to your insights. here a few quick and simple ways to boost your traffic: 1) use an analytics service . wonder how i knew about the increase in traffic from blogger.com? my analytics service helped me track it. if you aren't using one, i would suggest you do. most of these services are free - statcounter and google analytics being two of my favorites - and will start giving you fascinating data immediately after you add a few lines of code to your template or add a widget. imagine being able to see who sends the most traffic, which search words bring people to your site, and how folks navigate your blog. this week my top referral sites were run100s.com (stan jensen's encyclopedic site on ultrarunning), wikipedia (largely on dean karnazes inquiries), and forum.somethingawful.com (from a forum conversation that linked to toenail removal), and my top search terms were "caballo blanco", "coconut water", and "cross country championships". it's a fascinating time suck. ;-) once you get some analytics, a few of these other suggestions will make sense. 2) add the linkwithin widget . if you look at the bottom of my blog entry, you'll see a thing that suggests other blog posts you might like. that's linkwithin , and it's a very simple free widget to add. on average, it has increased my traffic 18% without having to do a thing. but more importantly, it helps convert a lot of first time visitors into reading 2-3 pages. odds are a few of them will be more regular readers. 3) bring on the pics ! behind google, my #2 contributor of traffic is images.google.com. this is from people looking for pictures of trail running, parks, people, etc., and has continuously been one of the big attractors of new readers to my blog. you can help google figure out what your pictures are about with some clever image naming, such as "2009_xterra_trail_running_world_championship_hawaii_max_king_winning.jpg". think about how many image searches might hit that - xterra, max king, hawaii trail running, etc. - especially over time. i've found a direct correlation to the number of pictures in a blog entry, and the number of visitors over time. basically you can't ever have too many and if you name the images correctly, they will pull readers in for years to come. on the flip side, i recently tried out "snapshots", a widget that popped up a pre-link window that did not do much for traffic so i turned it off. i've also added "recent comments" on the right, but haven't seen a noticeable change in traffic. but i find it useful, so i will leave it up a bit longer. got a great tip? let me hear it! it's how we all get better. thx, sd olympians and all-around running superstars dathan ritzenheim and shalane flanagan dominated the usa cross country championships in spokane, wa, this weekend. this was dathan's third and shalane's fourth national cross country title. &nbsp;(dathan ritzenhein, photo courtesy of photorun.net ) joining dathan (34:34 for 12k) on the national team are minnesotan patrick smyth (34:52), chico, ca's scott bauhs (35:01), fellow eugene, or runner ben bruce (35:16), admore, pa's bobby curtis (35:22), and gresham, or's ryan vail (35:25). &nbsp;(shalane flanagan, photo courtesy of photorun.net ) shalane (25:10 for 8k) led by 51 seconds, with 10k superstar molly huddle (26:01), flagstaff, az's amy hastings (26:09), olympian magdelena lewy boulet (26:09), boulder's rene metivier baillie (26:26), and mammoth lake, ca's sara hall (26:27) rounding out the team. runohio does an awesome job recapping the races if you would like to read more. - sd

'rage, rage, against the dying day...' for as long as i can remember, i have wished to hold images close to me, as though they were tangible objects. for a time, i believed this to be harmful or foolish, a fetishistic act of consumption useful only for the continual harvest of an insatiable hunger. but now i understand the way in which this reorganization of life informs my happiness; i call it magical realism. when i was a teenager i lived solely in a place of magical realism. at some point i have been each and every one of my great heroes, a cause to which i remained dedicated regardless of whether or not another person was present to verify the occurrence. the first few times i allowed others to pass into my private realm were common but necessary, images so familiar they might have been plucked from any coming of age biopic-reading aloud from the ginsberg anthology, enthusiasm fueled by stolen warm champagne, cross legged on the black cushion, youth tuned into youth (a concentration permitted only by the suspension of worry available in those days), giving finally a small performance of i shall be released... the morning after such exploits, when i climbed the hill near my parent's house and sat staring into the rising sun, its ageless puddle of light slowly engulfing every branch and stone, i had effectively transcended time. there was no great stopwatch separating myself from my heroes, for the experience of self-realization and initial discovery is always a virgin entity; its ability to repeat itself yet always be different lies in its being the definition of newness. the only absolute newness is creation. as a creator of music, i sometimes forget what it is like to experience music from an entirely non-critical point of view. so, what does this mean for me, berlin and the life blood canal that once extended before my eyes? it is arguable that all the wandering souls of the world (people like myself) have inherited christopher isherwood's haunted, candlelit land of eccentric intellectuals and cabaret shows and morphed it into an aimless place of hedonism and anti-everything logic, but really, it just depends on how you see it. if i can, for just one minute, block out the chattering buzz of the millions of technological advances that demand such an unending life force (phones, the internet, the ever-present flash of digital cameras), then i am left only with the advancing army of swans, the pink water, the beautiful memory of the ex-soviet bar, competing musical instruments drifting into consciousness from afar... in this moment, rosie is sally bowles and i am bryan roberts, and when i get home, she will be there, "dolled up for easter." thoughts from the present: so, many miles from berlin, i am giving myself over to music again; this is my aim and my wish. lost in a little village of guitar feedback and drum machines, i ponder the separation between the man and the music, the world and the single voice, the unceasing flow and the magic quality of a single moment. thrills, spills, mistakes, regrets, reflections, and most importantly, things to be thankful for, paint my vision in a rather kaleidoscopic manner, light refracting through a crystal lattice work. all the cities drift by, among them the seven hills of lisbon, the unrelenting stone facade of bushwick, the dark retro bars of st. pauli, the mountain and warm cheese in mexico, and of course, the chalky rose canal that carried me through berlin, across the ocean and directly into this moment-this moment, in which i am forced to remember how much magic has truly transpired. here i must digest all of this magic, allow it to dissipate among my cells, forming a lightning-fast network of electrical energy. slowly, it quells my anxiety and gets to work taking my little place of magical realism-the attic in wimpole street, the blue bulb of the stage light, the love affair with a guitar-from fantasy to the other side. and so, once again, a handprint is stamped across time. nico - i'll keep it with mine mp3 photograph by martin parr, from "the last resort." today i had a good feeling. having planned to meet my friends from hamburg, sonja and niki, for a rare combination of sustenance and culture, i walked out my front door, turned right, and traced the almost straight line to the samaritestrasse u-bahn station. before i could reach my final destination, oranienburger strasse, i was required to make two changes, one at alexanderplatz, and another at friedrichstrasse. normally, such a circuitous route would spark in me some form of anxiety (i tend to be unnecessarily short tempered when traversing the urban landscape) but today i didn't mind. in fact, the whole process transcended me as though by some divine intervention, and while i was making the first change at alexanderplatz i experienced the wonderful (see how it has been upgraded from good to wonderful) feeling of which i earlier spoke. the feeling was this: for the first time since moving to berlin, i was not conscious of where i was or where i was going; my thoughts were elsewhere-perhaps i was mentally reviewing a new piece of music, or possibly just reviewing the vacuous space that was beginning to fill my stomach region-but either way, i certainly was not forcing myself to be continuously critical of my every move. there's a certain self-consciousness, a kind of continual embarrassment, that goes along with being a new person in any place. you have sense that, at any given moment, every capable citizen is watching you, secretly laughing at your every misstep. but today i was just a piece of the machine, an ordinary gear in the ever-expansive clock of human interaction. sometimes it's nice to be part of a machine, it just has to be the right one. i arrived early, and spent about thirty minutes in the park, watching the sun's angle decline, appreciating the fact that i was using this civic gift just as it was intended to be used: reading, watching, depositing my cigarette ash in the ashtray provided for me by the government, understanding how parks act as little puddles of serenity, placed evenly around a city to balance out the madness. parks are almost living proof that everyone, even those in charge, is aware that life is more stressful than it needs to be. after lunch, we filed into the martin parr exhibition. i don't know how much you know about martin parr, but before today i knew absolutely nothing. the briefing i had received (from my friend moritz) was that his work focuses mainly on the grotesque contrasts/contradictions of modern western society, both at home and in areas of reduced financial prosperity. it is often the work of juxtaposition: statues of the virgin mary underneath a mcdonald's awning, british tourists stuffing their faces at a belgian holiday resort surrounded by garbage, sun-bleached couples seemingly miserable on a crowded ocean front. interestingly enough, there were quite a few photographs of glasgow, which is obviously of great interest to me. some, i did think, were particularly harrowing, specifically the photo of the men's barber shop, the walls of which were entirely covered with images of naked women. however, there were certain photographs that did not fill me with any sense of disgust. i remember, very specifically, a photograph which portrays a glasgow street, one where most of the buildings have been demolished and thus there remains only one or two tenements, one or more of their sides exposed. in the foreground of the image one can see a tennents beer sign, indicating the door to a pub. obviously, the idea is that, amongst such urban desolation, the most popular escape is liquid mental abandon in an aesthetically-impoverished setting, but when i saw this, the first thought that flashed into my mind was, sometimes life just looks like that. i lived in glasgow for three and a half years, and although i was a) a foreigner, and thus, in some ways, a tourist, and b) living in a very nice part of glasgow, i still lived there, and i still frequented quite a few places that didn't look entirely unlike this one. glasgow has a kind of grit and i don't think it's something to be ashamed of. during my time there, i picked up on an almost beautiful force, a simultaneous wisdom and madness that allows the people there to be drawn so close to each other, a sort of universal refuge under all that grey brick and grey sky. it is my belief that, an image such as the one i have described, is totally ignorant of that positive energy. two other images really captivated me. the first was of an elderly woman wearing a white cap and orthopedic shoes, eating alone in a mcdonalds, hunched over the table. even as i'm describing it now, it's nearly bringing tears to my eyes. i have knowingly done any number of things to destroy my body (drinking, smoking, whatever...), but this woman, why is she doing this? it's one thing to see a younger person eating a processed hamburger but it's entirely different when you see an elderly woman carrying out the same act. all i can think is that, either she doesn't know any better, or it's the only option she can afford, which brings me to my next thought: why the fuck do fast food companies make this shit available to people?! yeah, consumers have a choice, but all people, especially those in the business of distributing food products, must be perfectly aware that not all are consumers are equally educated, and thus they knowingly provide the crutch for susceptible eaters. drugs like heroin and cocaine are also really bad for you, and often a crutch, but they're fucking illegal, aren't they? i don't know why the powers that be, or people in general (who i suppose are the powers that be) are not bothered by this image of lonely old woman hunched over a styrofoam plate. i just keep imagining that it's my grandmother, who lived as a widow for the last forty years of her life, sat by herself in a soulless plastic box of a restaurant, thinking to herself, life is so unfair. it fucking breaks my heart. the second image which caught my eye is one which depicts a slew of tourists at a brighton beach resort, waiting to get to the front of a fast food queue. it is somewhat of an action/motion shot, causing the majority of depicted individuals to appear blurred. however, in complete focus, at the far right of the shot, stands a boy of somewhere between eleven and thirteen years, his right arm akimbo as he stares thoughtfully out of the frame and into the present. the remarkable thing about this boy is that he has the face and complete composure of a grown man. not the facial hair and wrinkles, or course, but rather the sense of understanding and inherent wisdom. during my time as a pre-school teacher, i noticed this trait in some of my students. the viewing of this phenomenon always fills me with a mixed sense of wonder, admiration and sadness, for in some ways, to understand too much too young is a hindrance. does this boy remember the day the photograph was taken? what was he thinking about? the photograph is from 1985. he must be in his mid thirties by now. as he walks the streets of whichever british town or city in which he resides, does he still have that same glaze of guaranteed assurance? does he think to himself, i've got the answer-i've always had the answer? and on the day the photograph was taken did he surmise that it was grotesque, that he was grotesque, that the whole situation of western capitalism was, for all intents and purposes, grotesque? fat. ugly. unhealthy. probably not, he probably just accepted that day as it happened, for that's how we live, isn't it? an image is capable of highlighting, later on, an essence that was present all the time, but went unnoticed. its power resides in its retrospective quality. and i suppose that's why carr's work, or any artist's work is important, even if it sometimes neglects the fullness of the human experience: be part of the machine, enjoy and accept the things around you, but don't forget, once and a while, to stop and criticize. i've just returned from glasgow, where i've finished up a recording with members of michael dracula, belle and sebastian, mother and the addicts, and obviously, myself. i'm quite pleased with it. not sure when it will be finished, if ever. the song was recorded at green door studios. in other news, i've relocated to berlin, i'm not sure for what, some sort of inspiration no doubt, so if anybody is kicking about and wants to hang out or play music or whatever, please drop me a line. i'm ready to restart, rewrite, re-everything. no more fear, no more holding back, time for brilsolage. plus.... this pink chair in my sublet is bloody fantastic. love, ramesh novicat de soeurs missionaires de notre dame d'afrique & four religious drummers - yesu ka mkwebase mp3 dear lacey, i was busy writing about something else, the loss of innocence and all this kind of shit, when i was suddenly distracted by your memory, or rather the memory of you, and thought that perhaps it would be better if i just wrote you instead. i believe it's because i was writing about high school, that miserable place which afforded us little more education than the camaraderie and independence that grew up inside of us, partially the product of choice, partially the product of necessity, that shared closeness that comes with the experience of being a social outsider. more specifically, i was recalling the bit of forest behind the school, the one we were never meant to visit, past the portable classrooms and pick up trucks, and that horrendous chain-link fence, the one which separates truancy from athletic participation. there's something really beautiful about that piece of land, that delicate fabric of trails and open fields which reminds you, if only for a second, that perhaps central texas is not the worst place on earth, a beauty which is no doubt enhanced by its forbidden quality. i'm sure it was you who made me go there first, or maybe it was courtney. i can never be sure. you were always forcing me to do stuff like that, to bend rules, to push boundaries, not so much because you were a junior revolutionary, but more because you had the foresight to understand that these temporary rules enacted to govern the lives of young adolescents are, really and truly, complete and utter shit. like the time you convinced me to ditch the career fair, and we spent the whole day mucking around south austin; you bought me a sandwich, and then we rolled our pants up, halved a piece of cake, and climbed carefully but deftly down the root-encrusted bank to the still and forgotten creek behind the sandwich shop. i might not be pushing it if i said that was one of the best days of my life. yes, that's what i remember-little moments of freedom. i think we were quite good at that, our little group. we attended school in a place where it is customary to see confederate flags, where the term "faggot" is thrown around with little to no objection, and where unconditional praise of the athletically gifted is encouraged (all typical traits of the southern experience, but one has to remember that it's disturbing that these things should ever become normalized). and so, in our own futile rebellion, we ate our lunches outside under the trees, sported our montage of paisley retro gear, pinstriped vests, and goodwill t-shirts, celebrated bob dylan's birthday with chocolate cake at seven in the morning, and generally tuned out the world by filling our ears with music that was long ago forgotten by many-or so i thought at the time. of course this is a regular occurrence, that feeling of togetherness which is born out of isolation, but i like to think there was something a bit different about our situation -it wasn't identifiable as any nationwide youth trend, but it was instead a bond colored by a complete and total obsession with the past, a fundamental belief that things were inherently cooler in the sixties. and they were. the first week of school, i didn't even know you, but i knew you enough to think that i was in love with you. and then, with minimal provocation, you agreed to sew onto my bag all the patches which i had collected over the summer-the grateful dead, jim morrison, the beatles, bob marley... the most obvious characters of retro obsession, which at that point, for me, held no cultural association of mainstream taboo. yours was the most finite stitching i had ever seen, so evenly spaced, and with all the patches placed at angles that allowed them to exist in perfect harmony. as soon as i held the now-transformed vessel in my hand, i knew that i was definitely in love with you, and always would be. maybe that's the benefit of going to school in the middle of nowhere: the popular trends take longer to reach you, the only norm is mainstream country music, so you have to find something on your own, something that moves you and gives you shelter from your incongruous environment, the one that, as somebody quite clever once said, "says nothing to me about my life." there is one event that i remember quite vividly, sticks out in my mind, a party held on your mother's land, just across the creek from your father's, in that magical nowhere dip where the only signs of life were the distant silhouettes of cows, presumably in place for tax purposes. on this particular night, we had managed to craft something of truly kesey-esque proportions: everything in my memory is shrouded in the flickering of several campfire lights, brief flashes of beards and naked skin, the competing strums of acoustic guitars, the kids from the neighboring school (namely your boyfriend and his team of beautiful hooligans) with their kent iii shirts, converse and gas station wine situated at the opposite flame, the constant sound of didgeridoos (by this point, the alaskans had arrived and firmly planted themselves on your land and in your heart), and last but not least the incredible image of courtney channeling mountain girl, wandering from person to person, offering each friend a poem from a jar, which had been folded into a pyramid shape (the poem, not the jar). "a poem for you..." that night, as david and i were ascending from the wilderness and back into my car, i remember turning around for one last look at the circle below of fire, bodies, and drone, and remarking to david that it looked exactly like a national geographic special, a fitting description, for earlier that week, you and i had fought because you assured me that, if given the choice, you would abandon all things familiar and western, and relocate to a specific aboriginal tribe where a popular game included forming a large circle with linked arms, consistently altering the resulting shape so as to avoid being touched by the shade of an overhead cloud. in this moment i believed that, maybe, just maybe, you were being sincere. just as well, then, that you left us for alaska, left school early to pursue something that, all in all, was far more worthwhile. sometimes i can't escape thinking that perhaps your decision to follow those bearded alaskans up into the wilderness meant you knew that you were to die young. although, i think everybody once and a while believes they are to die young, at least i hope that's a universal premonition, otherwise i should be concerned. sometimes i try to imagine all the events i missed while i was sweeping away at the cinema: the day you cut off your, long, famous hair, the endless paths carved through such esoteric towns as moab, utah in pursuit of that great, northern paradise, the hours spent studying the teachings of a western guru, and lastly the days spent in that cabin alone in alaska, trying to understand, as you said to me, your relationship with god. but there are things i do remember, things i don't have to imagine, like the many trips down to the university in search of several spoonfuls of bohemian insight, all of us lying in wait in my heavily shrouded bedroom, unanimously dreading the possibility that any parent might arrive before my father's decaying cassette copy of "sounds of silence" had come to completion. or an evening spent in my now-donated mercedes (used, of course); eyes closed as the song i'd written for you surged from the speakers, through my body, and eventually from my left hand into your right, all but filling the dense yet awkward-less silence. and then, of course, the last time i saw you. you were leaving for alaska or i was leaving for europe, i can't remember which. that evening i was closing down the theater, clad in maroon vest and nylon necktie. i met you in the parking lot for a hurried goodbye (sometimes that's the only thing available). standing outside in the vast space between the bookstore and the cinema entrance, one of us (i can't remember which) said, "i don't know when i'll see you again," and the other replied, "it doesn't matter," not as an indication of apathy, but instead a reminder that deep-rooted love is something you carry with you, like a talisman, or rather like that essential piece of metal sewn into the wall of my stomach lining. "even when i'm not with you, my love is with you..." each year, on the anniversary of your death, i intend to write something and never do, a disservice i always regret. instead, i'd like to remind you of something you wrote, something i had forgotten about until i saw your father at david's funeral the other day. there is more to say about david, but nothing you don't know, and now is not the time or place. he (your father) said to me that it's finally time to begin taking apart your room, to free himself of the many possessions left behind in that upstairs purple abode. as a start on the project of purging, i was handed a package containing photographs of you and david (i had forgotten how the two of you looked so much like identical twins), along with a story you'd written for school when we were fourteen or so, detailing where you might be in ten years. i stored these items somewhere safe (so safe i can't remember the exact location) and thus i am unable to quote your original text. but here's what i can remember-i can remember the rough penmanship, the sort that can only belong to a girl of fourteen, and i can remember the happiness that it brought me years ago when first i glimpsed it, a happiness which was rekindled when it was re-delivered to me much later. fortunately i can also remember the general outline of my favorite part. it had something to do with you joining nasa, training to become an astronaut and traveling to the moon several times. after that vision of yours was quenched, you married me, we had three beautiful children, and i like to think that we lived happily ever after. if you'd only known how, at the time, i carried this story inside of me, intentionally ignorant of its casual intent, and allowed it to foster all kinds of beautiful hopes within my being. but maybe it wasn't all disingenuous. as we discussed earlier, love is something that you carry with you always, regardless of its form. so many years later, all i can say is this: i'm glad this was your dream-because it was mine too. love, ramesh it's incredible to think of all of us out there in the world who want nothing more than to rest a head against a foreign body, passing each other in the street, continuing on with the same little empty space tucked somewhere deep inside. but it's all relative. i don't even need to elaborate upon why my concern of loneliness is partially ridiculous. famine, hunger... these are much worse, and perhaps with my little plea i'm tempting the gods of true loneliness. let's hope not. that's the thing- sometimes i feel like a spoiled fucking brat because i have a shell-shocked attitude regarding the things that surround me on a daily basis. i don't care about record reviews. i don't care about the internet. i don't care about the relative popularity of other similar bands who, apparently, the internet has told me i should view as competition. i care about writing music. i care about people, and they're getting harder and harder to hold close to me, or perhaps even to grasp in the first place. maybe it's because i'm lonely. maybe it's because i'm hungover. maybe it's because i came to the most beautiful city in the world and couldn't make it work. i wanted to relive that magical morning of my life with the marlboro lights and the window and the stack of nmes. sometimes i get really scared because i don't care about anything, and that's just fucking stupid because in the moments where it's all seemed on the brink of loss i've never been more afraid. it's those seconds where you realize that you don't make your own rules that really shake you up. when i get this way i have to comfort myself with the fact that i have music in my life. music understands the fact that i run through life too fast and expect everything to happen instantly. i'm just going to give myself to the stage, go into hiding and write something great, bounce around and kick my feet and scream and strum and scream and strum... twee as fuck: here is a "synchronized" routine we devised in grand rapids, michigan. check matt (favourite sons)'s solo at the end. i've just fully realized that our album actually comes out tomorrow. that's really exciting. today, we're filming our first music video, which is a process i had never even thought possible. watching people film in double time is amazing! the video is for firecracker, which i've decided is my favorite song on the record, along with real live version (a song written for judee sill-it's supposed to sound like that) and blood red blood. or at least those are the songs whose outcome reached their initial intentions the best... this friday we start our tour, which continues for about five weeks, a daunting prospect but fun nonetheless. it's interesting, this process we've been going through recently of having to bring the songs from the record into the live set. it was nice doing a bit of experimenting with sound when making the record, but i suppose the trick is figuring how to give the songs an equal amount of live energy as their counterparts. at least in austin and new york, we have tosca on our side and that's never a bad thing! hope to see you soon. love, ramesh 
Female: 100%, Male,  as we left the catacombs, we thought benadrix was struck ill.  he collapsed and his breathing came in short gasps. he quickly recovered and told us he had a vision, he could not remember much, but he said he felt anger and saw red. he also thought that he may have glimpsed a dragon. these visions that guide my new friend interest me, i was tought by my dwarven friends the importance of follwoing my own will, but even they hope for visions from moradin to guide them. how different is that from the guidance of the mind flayers? i will not worry myself with it, for now these strange events surrounding harken are enough. we went to the old cliffside brewery on our return to town, as we had assume we found old keller there along with orek gernsan, the ranger who we had met was not present.  both men seemed suprised to see us walk through the door.  we told them how we had routed the goblins, and what we had found in the catacombs, and more importnatnly to gernsan what we didn't find, his shipments.  overjoyed and true to his word, keller paied us the 100 gold promised us the night before.   we spent some time talking to keller, trying to gather as much information as we could.  so far no villagers have gone missing, and when we told him that the goblins were tied th the bloodreavers he was not supprised.  it appears chieg krand and his bloodreavers make their home north of harken, and have been less than desirable neighbors.   we retired to the inn for the evening.  aunt nonie was as supprised to see us return alive as keller and gernsan were, she had held our rooms for us, but not her breath.  before retiering for the evening we agreed once more that we would return to the catacombs in the morning. after a hearty breakfast (for my companions) we headded out to the catacombs, there was no end to the teasing of benadrix and his feat of streangth with the statue and his inablilty to break down a wooden door.  as we approched the catacombs, two goblins were exiting.  when they saw us they broke for the woods.  we went to make chace but from the forrest exploded a huge black dog, and almost as quickly it burst into smoke.  moments after the dog vanished an elf woman appeared fromt he brush.  she asked if we had seen a man go this way, she seemed very confused.  we tried to explain to her that the only thing we had going this direction was the dog who dissapeared, but taht we too were on the chase, after two goblins.   she contenued to insist a man had gon this way, and kept repeating a name "garrek esh."  after a few minutes of trying we callemd the elf down, and attempted to get her story one more time.  her name is cellence, and she is from sigil the city of portals.  the man she is perusing, this garrek, has escaped from some sort of prison she called the harbinger house.  most of this was lost to me, i had never heard of any of these places, but marrek seemed to know a little.  his reaction to hearing she came from sidgil was one of suprise, his knowlegd of it seemed to mosty come from children's stories he was told while growing up.  knowing the magic nature of sigil marrek suggested cellence should make her way to thunderspire, a nearby city ruled by wizards.  cellence asked to accompany us until she found her bearings in our world, aparently taking the portals out of sidgil is very disorenting. cellence accompanied us into the catacombs, there was no more signs of goblin activity.  we made our way into the chamber with the pit and locked door.  after a night of rest gnasc was able to pick the lock on the door.  inside we found a magic sword, being two handed it was deemed appropreat for benadrix to carry it.  perhaps it will serve as a reminder to him next time that his feats of strength should be resurved for locked doors rather than pushing statues into pits.  we removed the debre blocking the other door and followed it into a large underground cavern with a lake in the middle.   we were supprised by some bats, and it took us a moment to gather our witts.  like clockwork the four of us fell into battle, cellence must have been shaken from her trip through the portal because her magic seemed to escape her.  as we were about to dispach the final bat, it dove into the lake.   the surface of the lake began to bubble up and a black dragon rose from its depths.  it wasted no time shrowding itself in darkness and attacking.  while most of us stood still struck with fear, the faithful gnasc (who's scarred body is proof he has seen far worse than a dragon) tried to snap us out of it, only marrek responded.  the fight with the dragon was tough, it moved around the lake, retreating to the depths at times.  once during the fight i thought i was finnished but marrek lept between me and the dragon, scoring a devistating blow to the beast and saving my life.  i did not have time to think about it in the moment, but cellence must have felt bad during the fight, the neasuea of the portal was still effecting her ability to weild magic.  marrek delt the killing blow to the dragon, and not a moment too soon, i fear had the fight lasted any longer we all would have perished. in a small cave in the back we found the stolen shipments of ale from the clifside brewery along with a chest containing a gem and a magic dagger.  one of the casks was busted open, fromt he inside.  the remenants of a black dragon's egg was inside this cask, along with a scroll written in draconic.  it read: "to the vigorous soldier and noble friend armos kamroth, i send my most sincere greetings in the name of tiamat. may you continue in good health and good spirits, most reverend and divinely favored lord and may my humble gift provide you some aid in your endeavors." we returned to the cliffside brewery with the remaining casks of ale and more than a few questions for orek gernsan.  after a bit of questiong it was clear he did not know about the dragon, and he suggested we seek old keller to help us gain an audience with baron stockmer.  we found keller at aunt nonie's, and he agreed to set a meeting for the morning. we setteled in for the night, only to be awaken by the sounds of fighting outside and the glow of fire through our windows.  arming ourselves we rushed outside to help where we could.  two bugbears and a handfull of hobgoblins were in the town square, and set upon us as we exited the inn.   it was a gruling fight, the aches from the battle with the dragons were still fresh, just when we thought we had the square cleaned out more of the goblinkin poured into the square.  benadrix and i were exausted but stood to face the sub commander as our friends dispatched the remaining archers.  merrek acted quickly again this fight and saved benadrix from sure death at the point of an arrow, this allowed benadrix to help me finish the sub commander.  even at the end of the battle the night was not won, much of the town was on fire, and the goblins had taken some of the townsfolk prisoner. we found a letter ordering the torching of the town, on the sub commander, and that the chared bodies of the dead were to be brought to thunderspire.  marrek claime the commanders sword, clearly a magical weapon.   when the fires were out, we reited back to the inn where old keller was waiting for us.  he thanked us again for saving the town and presented me with his shield from his younger days, it is covered in dwarven and draconic runes and he explained that it will protect me as well as my allies.  exausted we headed back to our rooms, the meeting with baron stockmer tomorrow seems like an eternity away. your friend, 148 marekk lagonn stood at a crossroads. the old kings road cut through the nentir valley. it was crisscrossed by smaller trade routes and mountain paths. it was at one of these intersections that marekk stood now. his father's sword felt heavy at his waist as he studied the road in front of him. he had left the place of his birth nearly a year ago after making every effort to restore his family's name. had he given up? should he have tired harder? was his father looking down on him now and shaking his head in shame as the last of the lagonn line wandered the world, lost in more ways than one? marekk sighed and looked to his trusted companion. the gnoll stood a few yards back studying the dense forest on either side of the road. gnasc smelled something in the woods that much he was sure of. the trees were no doubt full of animals but this scent was different, strange. he lifted his massive head and straightened his long ears, straining to hear something. since marekk had freed him from that slaving camp he had followed the human on his journey. he seemed to have no clear destination in mind but that didn't bother gnasc. the man had risked his life to save him from a life of slavery, and gnasc owed him something. he wasn't sure exactly what, but he was determined to follow marekk until his debt was paid. a branch broke in the woods to the east and gnasc's head snapped up in that direction. marrek's hand shot to his sword handle as he also reacted to the noise. 148 stood in the trees watching the strangers. he'd heard them coming and had chosen to hide along side the road and wait for them to pass. but they hadn't passed. the human and his gnoll had just stopped at the crossroads. the man seemed to be trying to decide which direction to go next. it was a simple situation and not an uncommon problem, unless you happen to be a magically animated mechanical construct. 148 had never had never known what it was like to choose a path. he was built to serve and fight for his master and that's exactly what he did. even after being rescued and repaired by dwarves who told him he was now free he still didn't fully understand the concept. they had taken him to the old king's road and told him to go off and choose his own life. he had simply followed the road with mechanical precision unsure what it meant to choose. now he sat in the woods watching this human survey the roads ahead of him and he was fascinated. what was going in on in his head? his massive frame shifted in the wet ground and a twig snapped under his weight. when he looked back to the road the human was staring directly at 148, his hand on his sword and the gnoll seemed to have vanished. marekk was surprised to see a warforged emerge from the tree line. the massive war machine walked slowly from the woods his hands raised in the universal symbol of peace. the irony was not wasted on him. he relaxed his sword arm but left his hand resting on the hilt. gnasc appeared from the shadows behind him. no matter how many times he saw the gnoll pull this trick it never ceased to impress him. he was just about to ask the machine what exactly he was doing hiding in the woods when he heard a deep laugh from just up the road. benadrix walked the old kings road completely content. he had been chosen! thank kord he had been chosen and his destiny had been made clear. a paladin might serve his entire life and never receive such a profound vision. kord had showed him the village of harken and let him know that his future started there. he'd meet a group of travelers on the old kings road and together they would go to harken. as he crested a hill he saw a strange group ahead of him. a human, a warforged and a gnoll all arranged in what looked like a standoff. he laughed as he approached them, surely these were the companions kord had shown him! marekk watched as the dragonborn approached their group. he walked right between him and the machine without breaking his swift stride. he guessed that the beast was smiling but the rows of razor sharp teeth made him uneasy. the dragoborn continued on down road. without even looking back he said in heavily accented common "what are you all waiting for, harken is this way!" the warforged looked at the human and the gnoll and then walked off after the dragonborn. marekk and gnasc shared a look. this was simply too strange, they had to find out what was going on. marekk straightened up, adjusted his armor and walked off after the dragonborn. he looked up at the sky. the horizon was crowded with heavy black clouds. a storm was coming. after a cold day in the rain we came across harken village. looking to warm up and escape the rain we asked for directions to the local pub. we were directed to the old cliffside brewery, and no sooner had we sat down than we were approached by an old dwarf named keller. old keller told us about how the village was being terrorised by a band of goblins, and asked if we could help. he seemed truly concerned, and when it was clear he was speaking for the whole town when he offered us 25 gold each to help rid the town of these goblin raiders. benadrix tried to squeeze some more gold out of him but keller said the best he could do is the 25 gold and free food and lodging while we were in town. marrek agreed first, and predictably gnasc was quick to agree too. when i agreed that i would help too i was afraid benadrix would part ways and our short friendship would be over but he too agreed to help the village, but only after he was given a room and a nights rest. old keller took us to the only inn in town, aunt nonnie's . keller secured us four rooms, and aunt nonnie was clear that it was costing her 5 silver apiece but she was happy to do so if we could rid the town of the goblins. not needing to sleep i thought about just asking for the silver but i didn't want to cause any problems within our fledgling group. aunt nonnie seemed empty except for the four of us so we headed back over to the old cliffside brewery to see if we could gather any more information on these raids. when we entered the pub this time gnasc noticed an elf in the corner who was spending a little more time looking at us than anyone else in the room. he was also equipped much differently than the locals, with a bow and two fine swords my guess is that he is a ranger. we approached him, thinking he may know more about these goblins than others. he was not very interested in talking and in fact tried to turn use away from his table, until benadrix convinced him otherwise. if he knew anything he did not let on, talking to him was almost as productive as talking to a wall, even after marrek bought him a drink. after a few fruitless minutes of trying to talk to him, marrek went to talk to old keller and the bartender, orek gernsan . it turns out that the cliffside brewery has been hit hard by these raiders, about half of the shipments to neighboring towns have been hit. gernsan asked us to bring back any of these lost shipments that we may find. after a restful night in the inn, old keller took us to the entrance of the catacombs that he believed the goblins were hiding out in. gnasc snuck in first, i am still amazed at how stealthy he is for being even bigger than me, and checked the room. there were three goblins seated around a table. eager to prove myself to my friends i rushed in, with them right behind me. we had a bit of a rough fight, especially after two more goblins appeared from the shadows. while it may not have been the prettiest fight we were able to defeat our foes and after searching the room we also found a pouch with 40 gold inside. after a short rest, we followed another hallway where we found some more goblins, one who seemed to have just finished up some kind of ritual. gnasc was not able to sneak in on this group of goblins. the hexer in the back of the room summoned some rats, who launched themselves with reckless abandon at us. benadrix and i quickly tried to make our way to the hexer thinking he would be the biggest threat in the room, but before we could reach him he summoned two large fire beatles , and gnasc and marrek were separated from us by them. we fought hard, and did much better than the previous battle. though he was bloodied we were unable to stop the hexer from escaping through a door to another room. taking a moment to gather ourselves we searched the room, and i found a large gem in the bottom of the brazier. the door the hexer went through opened up to a large room with a vicious looking statue overlooking a large pit in the floor. there was a large dire wolf behind an iron grate, with two goblins standing guard near it. one of them too close to a leaver that most certainly would set the dire wolf free. the hexer was across the room, and there was another even more ornately dressed goblin across the pit from us along with a smaller wolf. there were also quite a few goblins in the room as well. early on in the fight i was magically pulled into the pit by the warcaster , and shortly after that marrek was also dropped into the pit. i helped him escape, and when i managed to climb out my friends had cleared much of the room, and to my relief the dire wolf was still caged. i was able to finish off the warcaster , but the hexer , while still recovering from our last battle still put up a good fight. he was able to pull the lever to free the dire wolf just before he died. the dire wolf was in a frenzy by the time the gate opened, but it was so bloodthirsty that it did not put up much of a fight. i felt bad for having to kill the dire wolf, but it was so worked up having been caged by those goblins we did not have a choice. we discovered a locked door and while marrek , gnasc , and i struggled with it, benadrix busied himself with pushing the statue into the pit. we were unable to open the door, but we did find a crued map of harken on the warcaster with the brewery marked, along with the estate of baron stockmer . there was also a note about capturing villagers for slaves. there was a second door blocked by lots of rubble, clearly done by the goblins. while interested in the door, we were exhausted from the fights and thought it best to warn the town of what we found. we were unable to find any of gernsan's shipments, but perhaps they are behind the locked door. i am also interested to find out what has the goblins so scared they would block off the door in the last room. i also need to learn more about baron stockmer . also after spending the first years of my life in something like slavery i will not let any of these villagers be subjected to that, i only hope my new friends feel as strongly about this. your friend, 148 
Male: 100%, Male,  on april 11th, a show that may well end up being the next great television drama will debut on hbo. i have written about treme in the past, but in case you have not paid attention, here is the dealio: treme, named after the faubourg tremé neighborhood in the french quarter, is set in post-katrina new orleans and looks at the situation through the eyes of the jazz musicians. the cast is damn impressive and features simon vets mellisa leo ( det. sgt. kay howard in homicide: life on the streets), the wire's clarke peters (the wire), wendell pierce (also from the wire) and khandi alexander (the corner) as well as john goodman, steve zahn and kim dickens. here is the new trailer to get you ready. trailer with season one barely over, word comes that there will be a change in the cast for season two. marsha thomason will be returning as fbi agent diana lancing, the character she played in the series pilot. marsha has previously appeared on lost and las vegas. as she comes, natalie morales will be leaving. natalie played agent lauren cruz in throughout the season, but often in a minor capacity. natalie will be staying within the nbc/uni family as she joins the nbc comedy parks and recreation. season two begins this summer. good news for fans of victor gischler : director sean byrne is on board for the planned film of of the very cool go-go girls of the apocalypse. mortimer tate was a recently divorced insurance salesman when he holed up in a cave on top of a mountain in tennessee and rode out the end of the world. go-go girls of the apocalypse begins nine years later, when he emerges into a bizarre landscape filled with hollow reminders of an america that no longer exists. the highways are lined with abandoned automobiles; electricity is generated by indentured servants pedaling stationary bicycles. what little civilization remains revolves around joey armageddon's sassy a-go-go strip clubs, where the beer is cold, the lap dancers are hot, and the bouncers are armed with m16s. accompanied by his cowboy sidekick buffalo bill, the gorgeous stripper sheila, and the mountain man ted, mortimer journeys to the lost city of atlanta -- and a showdown that might determine the fate of humanity. byrnes'feature film debut, the loved ones, won the midnight madness audience award at the toronto film festival and generated quite a buzz in the film world. prior to the loved ones, he directed a number of shorts and has been compared to a young sam rami. that is a hell of a compliment. check out this interview with twitch.com . i have always enjoyed victor's work, but go-go girls rocked mightily and was one of my favorite books of 2008. it kicks ass and is a lot of fun. if you have not picked it up, do yourself a favor and get a copy right now! hbo has announced that season three of true blood will begin sunday, june 13 at 9:00 p.m. (et/pt). mill creek entertainment release date: march 9, 2010 msrp: $14.98 runtime: 20 episodes, 720 minutes, 4 discs silk stalkings is another stephen j. cannell-created series previously released on dvd by anchor bay, discontinued, and now re-released by mill creek. first aired in 1991 as part of cbs's crimetime after primetime lineup, the show focused on two partners in the west palm beach, florida pd assigned to sexually-based crimes of passion. as its timeslot and title suggest, the show was more risqu&eacute; than much of network tv at the time, but seems tame compared to today's fare. while there was a lot of flash, co-stars mitzi kapture and rob estes had more substance in their performances than you might expect. kapture's rita lee lance was beautiful, but also driven by a brain aneurysm that plagued her with headaches and threatened to burst anytime. estes's chris lorenzo was more casual on the surface, but a dependable partner and friend to rita. both actors could pull off the show's mix of saucy and serious dialogue. when crimetime after primetime was cancelled in 1993, silk stalkings moved to usa network, where it ran until 1999 with new partners rotating in a la law &amp; order—a testament to the strength of its premise. i have a soft spot for first seasons and enjoyed revisiting the show as first conceived. the first season also features ben vereen as chris and rita's captain and danny gans as medical examiner roger. this set has no extras and is packaged in inconvenient, flimsy paper-and-cellophane sleeves, but as with all mill creek sets, the $14.98 price is the real draw. --gerald so with just a month to go before shooting, the cast for mildred pierce is starting to fill out. with more names coming out this last week, i thought this would be a good time to take a look at who is who so far: kate winslet: the title character. mildred pierce had gorgeous legs, a way with a skillet, and a bone-deep core of toughness. she used those attributes to survive a divorce and poverty and to claw her way out of the lower middle class. but mildred also had two weaknesses: a yen for shiftless men, and an unreasoning devotion to a monstrous daughter. (joan crawford in the original). do i really need to talk about kate? evan rachel wood: veda, the aforementioned monstrous daughter. despite mildred's attempts to provide a better life for her, vera wants more and will do almost anything to get what she feels she deserves. (ann blyth). wood played rourke's daughter in the wrestler and was quite good in the upside of anger. guy pearce: monte beragon, the wealthy playboy that eventually becomes mildred's second husband. almost immediately, we learn that things don't end too well for him. (zachary scott). pearce is best known for l.a. confidential and memento and recently appeared in the hurt locker. brian f. o'byrne: bert pierce, mildred's first husbamd, after he loses his job, mildred leaves in hopes of finding a better life (bruce bennett). o'bryne can currently be seen as aaron stark on flashforward and was colin on brotherhood. james legros: wally fay, bert's former business partner (jack carson). legros was recently seen as dr. dan harris in mercy and also had regular roles in ally mcbeal and sleeper cell. he also played raylan givens in elmore leonard's pronto on showtime. melissa leo is ida corwin, mildred's friend (eve arden). leo was nominated for an oscar for her performance in frozen river and will be in the upcoming david simon series treme on hbo. morgan turner: veda, younger but still a wretched creature. todd haynes co-wrote the screenplay and will be directing. he wrote and directed 2002's acclaimed far from heaven (which got him an oscar nomination). i want to open this up with the disclosure that i am not a fan of the stargate franchise. i'm not saying i don't like, i'm saying i don't know it or watch it. i saw the original movie and really enjoyed it. i've seen a few episodes of the two show, stargate and stargate atlantis and it didn't really move me one way or the other. another sci fi show to watch to kill time in a pleasant enough way. ol' jeremy asked if i was interested in this and the name robert carlyle got my attention. i'll watch anything he does, and so far i've enjoyed all his work. so, quick stargate rundown. mankind discover gateways to other worlds put here by a group they call the ancients. being mankind we start to explore going to other worlds. now you know all you need to to watch this. a group called icarus is on a planet with a very powerful gate. to access an as yet unreachable destination they need help cracking a code. they recruit a genius who lives with mom and plays video games all day. they crack the code just as the location of the group is under attack. most people shoot to a ship and back to earth, however a smaller group of civilians and military go through the gateway and land a ship called the destiny. new mission, find a way home. they can communicate with earth through tech originating with the ancients that lets them swap bodies, however they are mostly on their own. they need to find food and water and keep the ship running. carlyle plays a scientist(dr, nicholas rush) who is obsessed with the ship and really cares about nothing else. elli wallace is the young genius who is just fascinated by it all, but also the most interesting as he is not influenced by either faction wanting to control the tech. everett yong is in charge, but it's shaky at best. minng na plays a human resources person who is representing an oversight group with their own agendas. other layers include various military and civilan folks who work together to try and get home. lou diamond phillips is a colnol telford who was supposed to be in charge of a team ready for this mission instead of the rag tag team actually on the ship. he adds a wonderful dynamic to the cast. even richard dean anderson from the original series has a role here and it really ties it together nicely. i love the cast with one exception. ming na is a crappy actress. i couldn't stand her on er and i don't like her here. she over does movements and facial expressions and always looks pissed off. all the other people on the show seem natural in their roles, she seems to over think it and it feels false. i hope they kill her off in a nasty fashion. they even added a lesbian element to her character which really does nothing other than try to be hip. kill her off. other than that one character i love this show. it has elements of various other sci fi things i've seen and enjoyed but it is also very character driven and well plotted. whether you are a fan of stargate or not i think this is a shoe worth checking out. season 1.0 was a lot of fun and the dvd set was over faster than i would have liked. i'll be watching all the rest as soon as they come out. so end result: i love everything about the show except for one actress. i recommend this. buy stargate sg-u: 1.0 season 1.5 comes back on the air april 2nd. when i heard the news that the cast was changing i was mad. i love vincent d'onofrio and kathryn erbe on the show and after 8 seasons i want more. i questioned what the hell they were thinking. i've seen the first two episodes of season 9 and i have to say the send off was perfect. loyalty part one and two were really something special and on the strength of these two episodes i think the show will still be a favorite. something weird is going on with their captain (eric bogosian) and goren and eames are not going to let it it sit. before long things get crazy with the international implications, fbi and the upper brass in nypd all tangling things up. i don't want to give anything away plot wise, but the title of the shows, loyalty is right on. goldblum is great, i like his new partner played by saffron burrows (boston legal) a lot as the new detective from chicago. don't worry, it looks ike law and order criminal intent will still be a great show, and i for one, can't wait to keep watching. look for it on tuesday march 30th on usa network 
Male: 100%, Female,  there was a stream of cars passing right before i took this picture. each one paused as it approached the green light, thanks to the curb extension which pinched the intersection as well as making the walk crossing distance so much shorter. such a nice treatment for this block, which is actually rather lengthy though residential, with parking on both sides. cars used to speed up the hill to catch the green light - this pinch point helps to remind them to take it easy. in the world of transportation, this is really great stuff and part of the downtown brooklyn traffic calming study , which t.a. instigated ages ago, and is finally coming to fruition. there are more than 100 improvements slated for this spring according to the nyc ddc and above is an excellent example. an interesting thing about nyc's improvements on the street: though there is an attempt to standardize improvements with the street design manual , there is also a wide variety of applicable treatments. these are the first white ada-compliant curb cuts i've seen in the city - i've also seen yellow and gray. i kinda like that there is some flexibility and experimentation with this, and not one size (or color) fits all. after decades of one-size fits cars, seeing how things break loose is rather fun. image by youngna park, available via the always wonderful 20x200 exciting news! t.a. is starting up a planning corps, to gather together planners/designers and apply their amazing skills for change on our streets. this idea was hatched out of numerous conversations with two different groups that only sometimes interact. one set was with t.a. staff who wanted to beef up on technical expertise and stay relevant. the face of advocacy has changed considerably in the past few years, tools are very different, technology development outpaces a small non-profit organization's ability to keep up, and the political climate is very different. generally, we're pretty nimble, but this is partly because we know when to change accordingly. the second set of conversations was with planners who had a itch to change the conventions of urban planning. how do we use planning in a way that benefits communities and organizations that really need it, instead of contributing to master plans that sit on the shelf or to eis's that become a mockery of true environmental sustainability impacts? not to say that long-term planning isn't necessary, but what can be done now to enable change? a call was put out for planners (e-mail me if you're in the nyc area and are interested in participating) and a project list from t.a. staff was compiled. but... as i was trying to come up with projects that people could work on, i realized that i was really grappling with conventions of planning and experiencing how deeply ingrained they really are. the staff came up with a long list of projects necessary for their campaigns. most of them are those that are one-on-one with a staffer or small group (aka the "client"), longer-term due to research, data collection, where the planner goes off to do work, whatever that is, and hopefully comes back with a final product. but the ones that the planning group expressed interest in are those that can be done in a group, at once and still end up with something useful. (charrettes qualify, but few other things do - can you think of any?) i was really challenged with coming up with "on the spot" project ideas where a group planners could come in and get their hands dirty right away. at minimum, planning projects must have a strong connection to t.a. advocacy - so that there is a high potential for change. that part wasn't hard. what was hard was thinking about re-structuring work so that it had at-the-moment application and was highly productive. i stopped worrying about how it would happen and embraced the idea that what we needed could be done in many different ways. but, that means that the hard work is really on us, the organizers of planning corps, to structure creatively any piece of work on the existing project list so that it can be done in a group, at once and productively. if we get through this though then maybe we'll start to see a shift in how planning can change. planning corps is new with lots of space for experimentation, so if you have ideas and suggestions, please do share. our first meeting will be march 24, location tbd. people's schedules change quite a bit as job/personal responsibilities shift, so the hope is that the way planning corps works - matching planners to non-profits/campaigns for change - will endure. it's all over the transportation world, but worth posting about here. nyc is getting closer and closer to delivering transitways - first select bus service , especially the designs for 1st and 2nd aves, now this proposed project on 34th street . thanks dot for trying out another innovative design in cbd manhattan. this is a huge improvement in terms of prioritizing use on our streets. what do vehicles really need to move? this is a much more efficient use of the public right-of-way, let alone a vast improvement over streets clogged with one-passenger cars. you can leave comments on the project page and there's a series of public input workshops going on this spring. (i would be curious about handling bicycle traffic, curbside management of drop-offs and deliveries, and timing of projects in other boroughs). via streetsblog , which you should visit for a detailed discussion and some interesting comments always love to see who wins the young architects program competition to design the front yard of p.s. 1 . pole dance by so-il doesn't look as salacious as it sounds. d, you're coming back to nyc for the opening, right? go for it! update: not public space related, nor really planning related, i realized belatedly. did i really fall for the sparkling logo? maybe. from good the objective make an infographic about neighborhoods and/or your neighborhood. the assignment missed the mak center's how many billboards in la. update: was wondering how i missed the billboards when i crossed paths with the art so many times...in the car that is. i'm rarely in a car in general. guess i never looked up in la. i'm fascinated by driving behavior in general. everyone trying to talk to each other while muted; imagine trying to tell someone where you are going while covering your mouth. little signals mean a lot. i also obsess over pedestrian behavior: are they walking for fitness, fun or work, with friends, where are they walking to/from, do they cross with the light? enthralled by the few mixed-use retail areas. it seemed like la lacks bus shelters though there are many bus riders. finally, i literally count cyclists, check out their bike and see if they obey traffic laws. total urban planning-transpo-geek. real guerrilla gardening from the artist pete dungey . 
Female: 100%, Male, as you can see, the enclosed blog post has been around far awhile. it has been typed and ready to go for more than a month, and was waiting for the rest of the thought to finish it off. i have done little so far this year but run and hide. i am having a hard time emotionally, but am not wasting time just whining about it. true, running from a problem does not lead to solving anything, but on the other hand neither does whining. my basic time fillers have been reading, 15 books since january l; running up the hill to the chapel, usually two to three times a day, four or five days a week; and last but not least, countless hours mopping, waxing and buffing floors. i have not heard from my brother, and at this point it seems fairly clear that he will not be writing to me at all. i have also lost all hope that any of my worldly possessions, tools, clothes, etc. will be available to me when i get out. it would appear to me that all i have to look forward to upon my release is what i take with me from here. as far as human contact goes at this point it is down to abby and you. i guess this is as low as i can get so i better start the rebuilding phase soon! i have plenty to say, i need to let it all out and see what develops. i am wondering if the blog is really the place to write the true inside prison story. oh yes, plenty of mano on mano sex, gambling away all my money, beating up on the weaker ones here, etc. kidding. maybe we could go the taxpayer report route. how about how all the overweight staff members continue to belly up to the inmate food bar and stuff themselves at taxpayer expense? okay just a little bitterness. i just caught a line in the ny post about amy fisher raising money for haiti by going nude at some long island strip club or something. apparently this mother of three and product of ny state department of corrections is embarking on a cross county strip club trip to promote her personal porn web site. i did read her memoir of her time in the system that includes at least two or three rapes from prison guards. one strange thing in my own life is for some reason i continue to receive the ny times. i am not sure if perhaps my brother has just not figured out yet that it is going on mom's charge card or what. i have not heard from my brother since his one letter, and i think i sent you a copy of my response. i did send a christmas card to mom, but have received nothing from them. ironically the ny times is still coming and i can tell from the mailing labels when the next payment is due. it is every four weeks. i wonder if bill has figured out that it is being billed to mom’s credit card or not. i could write and say okay instead of the paper send me the cash, but to be honest while i know it is expensive, it provides a vital link to a world outside that gives me a little hope for the future. not to mention the little nuggets i get to share with others. for example did you catch the story around thanksgiving about the drama camp that was performing in the macy's parade? i know you said you discontinued you daily newspaper delivery, but do you catch it online? the title of the article is around here somewhere on a single piece of paper for me to tell you and i do not know where the note is now. i thought it might be something to look into for your creative non hockey playing son. hey i found the note. the article was in the 11/20/09 edition. "happy campers command stage in macy's parade." the name of the camp is stagedoor manor theatre camp. not sure if it would be something of interest, but appearing in the macy's parade is not too shabby a place to be. time is fleeting, and i must end this typing session. i could try to continue by hand but it would quickly become unreadable. hopefully i will get some more sleep, and continue this letter to you. then i could easily take the issues in this letter and make plenty of blog material. the one true hope i have still of being of some use to at the least reinforce my sense of self and my humanity, and maybe still, a small but powerful, community of people that can take some part in my future existence. you are, as always, a powerful anchor in my life. i hope you are not being tossed around too badly out there in the real world. i know you too have pressures and demands on your time, and look forward to any part of that time you can share with me. i have even mentioned the missing night's sleep. i have become the sole keeper of the floors for the day area and much of the dorm. yeah we allegedly have porters, but this is one dorm where porters get away with not doing their jobs. more on this to follow. but for the last four or five months i have been responsible for mopping up the day area after 11:30 pm. then starting in november that included stripping the floors, and now i have put over eight coats of wax on them. this sunday evening i decided to not only mop the floors but do some buffing and rewaxing too. just mopping the floor usually involves at least two or three changes of the water in the buckets. one for the soap, one to rinse. so after doing a super special mop job i start using the high speed buffing machines to both remove some of the scratches and put a shine back on the floor. i am doing this work all by myself, which is actually a good thing, while all the other inmates sleep. i finish up around 6:30 am monday morning, just in time to make me a bowl of oatmeal and start laying the first three coats of wax in the dorm area. this takes me till about 12:00 noon, and then i have lunch which was another gift of venison, and up to the chapel i go both at 3:00 and again at 7:00 pm for two hours each time to work on the clerk stuff and computer program i am trying to do in excel, which is a trip since there are no help files installed. but what i can do is record macros, which are shown in visual basic, and try to edit them into workable code. i arrived back at the dorm around 9:00 pm and napped for about 90 minutes, and was back up at 11 pm to mop the floors. i got to bed around 1:00 am this morning, but was up at 7:00 am to put more wax on the floors. today we ended having our inmates move out of the dorm, and as a result a couple guys got to move into single cubes from the double cubes, and then we had a few new guys come in. so this high tech operation prohibited me from waxing today. i need to get about eight coats of wax to have the floor really shine. so instead of trying to catch up on my sleep, i ended up heading up the hill to the chapel at 9:00, 12:30, and 3:00. i finally arrived back at the dorm at 5:00, and around 6:30 was chowing down with a half pound of pasta with octopus tomato sauce. by the way since i have eliminated most of the comfort/munchie type foods from my diet i am down to 206 since september when i was pushing 225! i tried to disappear for a bit and take a nap but that did not work. so i have pulled out the typewriter and penned this opus to you. as i think i have mentioned to you, ray has sort of become an adoptive son to me. heck my oldest son is older than he is. anyhow, for the last couple of months, we have prepared and eaten at least one meal a day together. ray is extremely conflicted about receiving financial support from his family, but they are certainly able to provide it. i need to tell you some of the stories ray has told me, to let you get a clearer picture of his life. one recent night, he sought me out to talk after getting an emotionally conflicted call from his adoptive mom. his bio mom is apparently a real jerk. one note is of course i have no outside collaboration which adds a layer of mystery to this whole thing. so ray tells me it is not fair, i have it all together as to how to handle life, and his life is in total chaos. ray's payroll from the mess hall has varied from $14 to $28 every two weeks, so once we decide on the meals for the next two weeks, he would spend most of his money, and i would pick up the rest. in addition i would still get my three boxes of oatmeal, ten packets in each. i use two at a time, and two jars of peanut butter plus two loaves of wheat bread for my lunch. the meals would be pasta or bean dishes. the point is that now with my funds all but gone, he still has not gotten around to getting in any funds, and while there are a few specific amounts he owes me, it was always assumed that at some point in the near future, he would become the larger contributor. or not. that is what i deal with: is he for real in seeking out my wisdom and support, or is he a fine tuned con man who has managed to eat well for the last few months at my expanse? it is hard to tell. yes, i could choose to not share my resources with others, but that is not who i am. i laugh when i tell others that did not realize when i moved into my cube that it was also the condiment bar for the dorm. one inmate for instance, who is leaving in six weeks, gets monthly packages from home, full $55 buys from commissary, yet he ask me for ketchup to dress up his food bowl. another inmate that works in the kitchen and has access to all sorts of condiments also asks me for ketchup etc. to dress up the burgers and things he takes back from the mess hall. another inmate just tonight said he needs my help. he apparently did something dumb at work in the mess hall and ended up getting a ticket. one other golden tidbit ray dropped at dinner tonight was that darnell and another inmate that lives in our dorm were caught fucking around in a back area of the mess hall. the officer that caught them is the one that ray said did not want me working there. as a result the one inmate lost his job, but it looks like no penalty against darnell. for the record, darnell is 240 pounds of solid muscle. when i asked ray if he meant fucking around in the sexual sense as opposed to a more physical horseplay, but also prohibited behavior, he said the sexual. so go figure that one out. in other words, the fucking around was at least consensual, but at worst, darnell was the aggressor. mind you, the truth is such a hard thing to find out around here. i do not know who or what is the truth. although mark, heretofore the unmentioned inmate, did lose his job in the mess hall, the really strange part is that mark is about 80 days from the door. go figure. so i am not sure if i have mentioned darnell biggins to you before. he is the inmate clerk in the mess hall, and in the past has made my life miserable, and made it tough for me to find time to work on the computer once they had taken my personal machine from me. today i see him up at the chapel and i happen to mention the $2.00 and change missing from my pay. he says that should not be. i further mention that it appears they have switched my job number, which governs the normal hours i get paid, and the rate. he claims he did not know that it was switched. it has been going on for over six weeks, and i know he personally fills out the preprinted time sheets with all the hours for each of the 100 plus inmates listed. since i used to be in a group of six or so inmates listed on their own page, and am now on the regular list with about 65 other inmates, it would be tough to miss. he is either stupid, or lying to me. i happened to mention to ray (carlton) that i talked to biggins, and that biggins said the reason i was still not working was that two staff people did not want me around. one is an officer, the other, one of the civilian cooks. ray mentions no, it is another one of the officers down there that does not want me there. ironically, all of the people mentioned have been there for a while and while i might not be their best friend, i was working with them in the past. the point is that i do not know how much of what darnell -- oops, so used to staff people calling inmates by their last name -- is saying is possibly the truth, nor what ray says is the whole story either. it still amazes me not only that any staff person is willing to look the great gift of my services in the mouth, and how little power john black, the food service manager has over what goes on in the area he is responsible for. are you able to follow any of this, or do you even care? i am not sure how much of this i really want you to write back about, but if you want better (more) detail just ask. i would rather you not mention specific questions just in case your letter does get read on the way in. my life of late has been little more than a downward spiral. as i was taught way back when, "cheer up i says things could be worse." sure enough i cheered up and they got worse! you last letter started off with a complaint of lack of letters on my side. i sent two letters in a few days time, and then silence. okay i know from your christmas card, you were fighting some bronchitis (why did you wait to go to doctor!) and it was the busy christmas season so i thought i might hear from you by now. alas, the old wait for tomorrow trick has now seen twelve days pass. so i am writing now. i am wondering if i put too many requests in my last letters and you are pissed off? i thought i had told you if you ever feel the requests are too much, skip them. there was the question posed by the person about having me write more about the inside perspective of prison. i think i have also sent you a copy of the letter i finally sent back to my brother. so i thought there should have been something there to write back to me about. if not, then hopefully something in this missal will tickle your fancy. i hope so; certainly my life has not had many tickles in it. about the only ray of sunshine in my life has been abby, and she surprised me with a bunch of books that arrived here at the end of last month! boy do i remember the frequent, numerous and much awaited book drops you used to make. i no sooner get back from the package room and three or four inmates are already at my bunk wanting to see what titles i got in. one reason i am writing now, 8.15 pm on tuesday, is i received my bi-weekly commissary sheet today upon my return from the chapel. for the first time in many years i only have $55.20 in my account. my pay for my no-show job has been adjusted downward to $13.30 per week. my last three commissary buys were for $76.57, $73.85 and $64.37. so with only $13.30 coming in, things are looking really depressing. i am looking at my handwritten letter. either there is another letter or perhaps i misdated that one. no, in all likelihood my funk has led to delusional thinking that i am writing more often to you than i am. boy that is a surprise. i just received a letter from abby, and she ended up spending a few days in two different hospitals to be diagnosed as having severe stomach problems apparently related to the loss of proper nerve functioning related to lifelong battle with diabetes. the medicine they are giving her is only a stopgap measure, as you are not supposed to take it for more than three months. she went to a local hospital over the weekend only to end up being transferred to a major medical center within the area. i do not know if you care but she lives in a town apparently in the middle of nowhere, and the nearest hospital can only handle more mundane ills so she was transferred by ambulance to the larger facility. i still have not heard from my brother, or even my brother acting as the letter writer for my mother. it appears at this point that i am never again going to be able to have a two way communication with mom. from the "cheer up things could be worse" department, well sure enough i cheered up and they got worse. i received my monthly statement today and it turns out for some unknown reason my weekly $15.20 pay from my mess hall job had now been reduced to $13.30 a week. on the one hand i should be grateful i have been kept on the payroll without doing any work, but on the other hand, if i am supposed to be paid x amount, then pay me that. i have to get my ass in gear and answer with more detail the issues i raised on my earlier letter. ray and i had a pound or so of venison sausage today in a tomato sauce with a pound of pasta, 1/2 each. there was some extra sauce which is about to have two cans of beans added to it and with a sleeve of saltines become a late supper. it is my second known encounter with deer meat and i have to admit it is pretty good. of course since it has been years since i have had anything that resembles red meat, this is certainly a treat. our regular officer has been off the past two days, (wednesday-thursday) and will be back tomorrow so i will probably be doing a whole bunch of floor scrubbing and waxing. also the 11 pm to 7 am regular guy is back in a few hours after his two days off so i will probably be up till 3 or 4 am doing stuff in the day area too. i did get a letter off tonight to jerry in california, so i will see if that pans out to another person to reach out to. oh wait a minute there was another letter which included my response to my brother! my typing without proofing leaves something to be desired i know. but i figured a few typos are better than no letter at all. i just do not have the patience at this point to proof and retype a letter i am struggling a bit. it seems i am a positive supportive presence in ray’s life and abby makes a comment about how i write to her more than her son john and she wants me to write more, that once in a while i need a place to go to recharge my batteries. that place/person just does not exist right now. on the one hand i want to yell at the powers to be that hey you let me do all that great programming for you for six plus months, you are still using it, i got little benefit for the value you received, and yet you now treat me like a black sheep of the family. please let me do what i am good at. let me build up my own self esteem since everything else around here is based on the premise that we can tear it all apart. so i hope you had a good holiday, i guess you had a few off, and now it is time to think about back to work. so now that you have gotten two letters this week, i am going to see if i can get some more out to you on sunday evening. 
Male: 100%, Male, no real analysis here, but i'd like to draw your attention to this recent article by kenneth chang in the new york times about recent work that might shed light on the very early earth. i am highlighting the article both because it deals with geochronology (u-pb zircon geochronology to be exact), and because it is a rare article dealing explicitly with geology; not modern climate change or some geoscience themed hazard, but straight up geology. the article also has some good quotes from some of the grand high mucky mucks of geology including mark harrison, john valley, and norm sleep. i've seen a talk version of some of this data before, and when i get into my office tomorrow i'll check out the nature paper as well and try to comment, although in all honesty i seriously doubt i'd come up with much more insightful than professors harrison, valley, sleep, and mojzsis.in consideration of self promotion, if you'd like some background on geochronology to help with the ny times article, check out this earlier post of mine, or any of the background geology posts i have listed on my sidebar.
Male: 100%, Male, nonprofit organizations—and their staff/boards—which are part of the institutional catholic church should clearly support the teachings of the church, just as employees/board members of any nonprofit have to be supportive of the mission of the nonprofit they serve. this story from the washington post reports on the issue. an excerpt. “shortly after imposing limits on spousal health benefits for employees, catholic charities of washington has begun requiring new employees to promise they will not "violate the principles or tenets" of the church. “that language was added march 3 to a hiring letter that new employees are required to sign, according to spokesman erik salmi. he said the move did not reflect a policy change because employees have been told during training that the organization is catholic in more than name. “catholic charities, one of the region's largest nonprofit organizations, has been trying to develop a way to continue its multimillion-dollar social service partnerships with the district while not recognizing the city's same-sex marriage law, which the d.c. council approved in december. employees were told this month that the agency was changing its health-care coverage to avoid offering benefits to its workers' same-sex partners. “salmi said the addition of the clause to the hiring letter was not a result of the new law but rather reflected a longer-term concern that employees adhere to the organization's catholic philosophy. “salmi said the new language "is more of an expectation than a condition. it's letting people know this is the culture." asked if that meant employees could speak or act against the church without being fired, salmi said: "we can't speculate on the hypothetical. it's handled on a case-by-case basis." “a former vice president of the organization's human resources department, however, said the new language appeared to be a change. "putting it in a letter and requiring a signature, that's a condition of employment. there's no way to dance around that," said wayne swann, who served 3 1/2 years on catholic charities' board of directors and an additional four years as its vice president. “shortly after imposing limits on spousal health benefits for employees, catholic charities of washington has begun requiring new employees to promise they will not "violate the principles or tenets" of the church. “that language was added march 3 to a hiring letter that new employees are required to sign, according to spokesman erik salmi. he said the move did not reflect a policy change because employees have been told during training that the organization is catholic in more than name. “catholic charities, one of the region's largest nonprofit organizations, has been trying to develop a way to continue its multimillion-dollar social service partnerships with the district while not recognizing the city's same-sex marriage law, which the d.c. council approved in december. employees were told this month that the agency was changing its health-care coverage to avoid offering benefits to its workers' same-sex partners. “salmi said the addition of the clause to the hiring letter was not a result of the new law but rather reflected a longer-term concern that employees adhere to the organization's catholic philosophy. “salmi said the new language "is more of an expectation than a condition. it's letting people know this is the culture." asked if that meant employees could speak or act against the church without being fired, salmi said: "we can't speculate on the hypothetical. it's handled on a case-by-case basis." “a former vice president of the organization's human resources department, however, said the new language appeared to be a change.

"we find it hard to reconcile this loss given the amount spent on executive salaries, perks and lobbying expenses," the letter said. "we are especially concerned because it is our understanding that some independent clubs have closed or are on the cusp of closing because of a lack of funding." “roxanne spillett, president and chief executive of the tax-exempt organization, based in atlanta, earned nearly $1 million in compensation in 2008. that includes a base salary of nearly $361,000, a $150,000 incentive and nearly $478,000 in benefits, expenses and contributions to a deferred retirement plan, a spokesman for the organization said in a written statement friday. “leaders of large nonprofits should earn competitive salaries, said ken berger, president and chief executive of charity navigator, a watchdog group. “the average compensation for executives at groups with more than $100 million dollars in annual revenue is $460,000, including deferred compensation, according to charity navigator.” a marvelous book i’ve been reading, giving well, doing good: readings for thoughtful philanthropists , has many excellent thoughts to ponder, and one comes in the discussion of the different levels within the reasons for giving; and the third level relates to the best reason. an excerpt. “the third level—which might be described as the most mature form of giving—is a way of participating in the life of others, or an expression of gratitude. here the key element is the other, the recipient; not the self, the giver. the giver wishes to be, and becomes a genuine participant who shares in an achievement by facilitating it. this giving also has the reward of a beneficent return, although the benefits are primarily for others than oneself.” (p. 129) this is a wonderful story, from the stanford social innovation review , about one person's vision-- it all so often starts with just one person --and her nonprofit's work to help immigrants to america become productive. an excerpt. “in 2000, while working for a national refugee resettlement organization in new york city, jane leu decided that the federally funded system of matching immigrants to careers was a failure. “we didn’t have an incentive to focus on [the] quality” of the placements, she remembers of her six years of putting highly educated, english-speaking foreigners in low-skill jobs. “it was just about quantity.” “so with no funding, a borrowed laptop computer, and her kitchen table as a makeshift office, leu started the nonprofit upwardly global, whose goal is to help highly skilled immigrants reclaim their careers in the united states. “the beginning was rocky. with no funds and no employees, leu was limited to one-on-one sessions with job seekers, reaching out to foundations for grants, and making employers aware of a hidden talent pool: 1.3 million bilingual workers with degrees and professional experience in every possible white-collar profession. “successes trickled in. by 2002, the organization received its first grant and hired its first paid employee. in 2003, leu’s work was recognized by the draper richards foundation when she became its first fellow, earning a $300,000 grant. “today, upwardly global employs 29 people to serve some 600 job seekers a year. with offices in san francisco, new york, and chicago, the organization also relies on its wide network of volunteers. since 2006, it has helped place 400 people with 300 employers such as google, genentech, wells fargo, the gap, safeway, and the fresh air fund. although upwardly global remains a small nonprofit with an annual operating budget of less than $2 million, it is widely credited for highlighting decades of “brain waste,” says jeanne batalova, an analyst at the migration policy institute. it is also the first organization that reintegrates professional immigrants into the american workforce.” most people are not aware of the large role that art—and the nonprofit cultural organizations that support them—play in the local economy, as they have in midtown and north sacramento. a recent study in boston, reported by the boston globe , reveals just how productive that role can be. an excerpt. “each year, 30,000 people visit the danforth museum of art. hundreds of youths participate in its free school programs, thousands of all ages enroll in art classes, and still more view exhibitions. “with this kind of score card, the danforth finds it easy to convince the community of its value as a cultural asset. “but an economic engine? “a newly released study suggests that the danforth and five other framingham cultural institutions generate nearly double their budgets in local spending annually, creating scores of jobs along the way. “for people who believe in the arts, they get it when we tell them art is good because we know it’s good,’’ said danforth’s executive director, katherine french. “but that’s preaching to the converted. when we go to funders or business leaders or town officials, we need to be able to point to an argument that isn’t a matter of opinion.’’ “so, the danforth and five other framingham cultural organizations — amazing things arts center, framingham history center, framingham public library, garden in the woods, and performing arts center of metrowest — united for an economic impact study paid for by the sudbury foundation. it was no academic exercise. “all six organizations are in the midst of, or are gearing up for, fund-raising campaigns to improve their facilities and ultimately make framingham a tourist destination. they say proof of the jobs and business they create cinches their argument for financial support — especially during tough economic times.” the nonprofit world has long played an essential part in the nation’s politics. one of its earliest chroniclers, count alexis de tocqueville, who came to america in the early 1800’s and met with many of the founders, wrote one of the most perceptive books ever written about america. here is but a small part of what he said about voluntary associations—nonprofits. “americans of all ages, all conditions, all minds constantly unite. not only do they have commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but they also have a thousand other kinds: religious, moral, grave, futile, very general and very particular, immense and very small; americans use associations to give fetes, to found seminaries, to build inns, to raise churches, to distribute books, to send missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they create hospitals, prisons, schools. finally, if it is a question of bringing to light a truth or developing a sentiment with the support of a great example, they associate. everywhere that, at the head of a new undertaking, you see the government in france and a great lord in england, count on it that you will perceive an association in the united states. “i have since traveled through england, from which the americans took some of their laws and many of their usages, and it appeared to me that there they were very far from making as constant and as skilled a use of association. “it often happens that the english execute very great things in isolation, whereas there is scarcely an undertaking so small that americans do not unite for it. it is evident that the former consider association as a powerful means of action; but the latter seem to see in it the sole means they have of acting. “thus the most democratic country on earth is found to be, above all, the one where men in our day have most perfected the art of pursuing the object of their common desires in common and have applied this new science to the most objects. does this result from an accident or could it be that there in fact exists a necessary relation between associations and equality?” (alexis de tocqueville, democracy in america , 2000 translation by h. c. mansfield and d. winthrop. pp. 489-490) today, the work nonprofits do in the political world continues, as this report from omb watch notes. an excerpt. “redistricting reform efforts have emerged as a key issue that could significantly impact our democracy in 2010 and beyond. while it does not appear that there will be nationwide redistricting reform, efforts are moving forward in several states. nonprofits have taken a lead role in advocating for a process that is independent, nonpartisan, and fair while also ensuring that their constituencies' interests are represented. “americans for redistricting reform (arr) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that bills itself as "committed to raising public awareness of redistricting abuses and promoting solutions that benefit voters and strengthen our democracy." its website allows visitors to learn about redistricting reform efforts in jurisdictions across the country. the site also contains fact sheets, court cases, research studies, and state and federal legislation on redistricting reform efforts. “arr was launched by the campaign legal center and includes major nonprofit organizations as advisory committee members, including the brennan center for justice, the campaign legal center, the committee for economic development, common cause, fair vote, the league of women voters, the reform institute, the republican main street partnership, and u.s. pirg.” it has many names, evaluation-outcomes-mission fulfillment, but whatever label is used, the point is that programs that ask for the public’s money—whether directly from the public in donations or indirectly from the public through government grants—to do something worthwhile, should be held accountable to have actually accomplished what it is they claim to have done. vpp news has an excellent piece on this. an excerpt. “in my last column, “‘social outcomes’: missing the forest for the trees?,” i wrote about my deep, nagging fear that many efforts to assess outcomes are woefully off track. i pointed to several wonderful beams of shining light in the field, from youth villages to the cleveland clinic. but my dominant message was that many efforts in our sector are causing more harm than good. that column hit a nerve, triggering a volume and intensity of responses far greater than i had expected. “after struggling though literally 20 drafts, i wasn’t sure whether the piece was even coherent. yet, it seemingly made some sense to a good number of thought leaders and practitioners i greatly respect—along with many others i don’t know who apparently care deeply about this issue as well. “of course, not everyone agreed with my analysis. in fact, i got hard pushback on some points, and a few commentators wondered why it had taken me so long to own up to my own limitations in my approach over the years to the topic of outcomes. “the majority, however, agreed with the thesis that we’ve lost sight of the ends we’re trying to advance. in the wise words of david hunter, managing partner of hunter consulting and former director of assessment for the edna mcconnell clark foundation: “it seems to me that the mess you describe indeed is enormous and very destructive—because few people involved in this work have thought deeply about managing towards outcomes and [they] have put the cart before the horse—focusing…on how to measure rather than on why measure…and what to measure.” “sins of commission, sins of omission the feedback confirmed for me that nonprofit executives, staff, and boards; donors; and assessment experts are deeply frustrated with our sector’s work around outcomes. • i heard a lot of anger at funders who don’t walk (or fund) their talk. • i heard exasperation with nonprofits that are unwilling to embrace even basic methods of determining whether they’re doing what they say they do. • i heard disappointment that outcomes assessment has become an exercise focused on cold numbers—the equivalent of robert mcnamara’s simplistic and terribly misleading vietnam body counts—rather than an effort to help nonprofit leaders achieve lasting impact for those they serve. “we must be intentional about surfacing these roiling frustrations that are rarely getting voiced. if we don’t, we’re going to continue to perpetrate sins of commission and omission that prevent us from making even the slightest dent in the failing status quo that defines education, healthcare, and social services in america.” one of the truly great examples of nonprofit work in education is the story of catholic schools in america and as they enter a trying period in their illuminating history, having help charting the waters is appreciated. the philanthropy roundtable—itself a remarkable story of american philanthropy—has produced a marvelous resource, the 146 page publication saving america’s urban catholic schools: a guide for donors , which they have made available as a free pdf download. 
Female: 100%, Male, it was a great experience and i have to thank andreas mitisek and the long beach opera for allowing me to photograph behind the scenes of one of their recent rehearsals. now, that being said, the person i owe the biggest thanks to is my favorite flautist, teri christian (aka fluteprayer, who writes the blog, fluteprayer ). i met teri and her husband, bob, through blogging and i've gotten to enjoy a couple of the performances (opera and municipal band) they've been involved with down in long beach (yay, long beach). i've been trying to work it out to to shoot one of the long beach opera performances for quite a while. teri has been the one working on getting me the okay to come in and snap away. i really hope i wasn't too much of a distraction. that was my biggest concern while shooting (well, that and also that i might suck at being a still photographer). no worries. things seemed to work out fine. the orchestra and the all the performers had their game faces on and i did my best to ninja my way through the rehearsal. (whoooo-wha-kai! click, click, click! ki-yaaa!) god bless the christians. (heh-heh, doesn't that sound kind of redundant?) our story was all about the coming boom in 3d entertainment technology.&nbsp; i was working with dave malkoff (who should really consider spelling his name m-a-l-k-o-v because that would be totally retro mad scientist sci-fi). &nbsp; we started in burbank, shot an interview and b-roll for the piece, then drove over to the burbank entertainment center to look for a good liveshot spot. we couldn't find a spot. well, actually we found plenty of spots.&nbsp; just none that would give us anything visually related to the story we were working.&nbsp; so, since we weren't going to be on tv until the later shows, we figured we should have plenty of time to dash over to la live. a good plan in theory. after battling crazy friday evening traffic, we finally made it to a good spot for a liveshot.&nbsp; we set up just to the north side of the regal theaters. right next to the psychic's office.&nbsp; office?&nbsp; hmm, what would you call it? anyway, we managed to cut a piece that touted the coming wave of home 3d entertainment.&nbsp; no liveshot after all.&nbsp; we needed to be back to the station before the end of my shift and i needed to do that without hitting the station with a meal penalty. so, it wasn't the most action packed exciting night at work for me.&nbsp; still, there's this one thing that i wanted to mention.&nbsp; i wanted to say just how cool it is to see parts of la that most people don't even know about. take mr. sippee for example. you might never have the opportunity (or logical reason) to try fried chicken sold at a gas station.&nbsp; heck, right minds would tend to avoid something like that. not me.&nbsp; but, then again, i did qualify that (yeah, right minds). quick history: i first found mr. sippee during the 1984 olympics (held in los angeles, if you remember).&nbsp; i was just out of school and working for abc sports.&nbsp; i don't remember why i stopped here, but ever since then, every few years, i manage to grab some chicken and their broasted potatoes. it's not exactly good, but it does take me back to a simpler time in my younger days. i can remember when i used eat junk like that and enjoy it.&nbsp; i'm glad i've grown up a little since then.&nbsp; i'm older and smarter and. . . (sigh) okay, let me have one leg and thigh combo with potatoes, to go. blogged with the flock browser it's not an excuse for not posting (come on, blogging is never having to say, i'm sorry!), but truthfully, it's been a difficult couple of weeks for me. you know, sometimes the postings are slow because i don't have much to say.&nbsp; sometimes they're slow because nothing much interesting is happening. sometimes they're slow because i'm dealing with things that don't leave me a lot of space to compose my thoughts in any form fit to share. that being said, today i'm trying to catch up on some the assignments i've had the last couple of weeks. last monday night, i found myself in a sat truck covering a candlelight&nbsp; vigil for amber dubois. there were thousands of people crowded into the courtyard of escondido high school.&nbsp; the vigil had started about 6:30pm.&nbsp; i was about twenty minutes too late to catch the beginning by the time i arrived. it's a long drive from north hollywood during the afternoon rush hour, but i had a pretty good idea of the route.&nbsp; i'd passed through escondido a week prior when i'd been assigned to cover the search for chelsea king. lots of time travelling there and back to think about things. anyway, it was another couple of hours before things slowed enough for me to pull my dslr out to snap a few still shots. by then vigil was over and most of the people had gone.&nbsp; so, right then it wasn't exactly me alone with my thoughts, but it was far fewer than had been there just an hour or so earlier. there was a sadness that hung over the area. i believe we are the sum total of the things we experience.&nbsp; doing what i do as a news photographer i get to witness more grief than most people. sometimes it's easier than others to keep that sadness from becoming my own.&nbsp; it's a struggle.&nbsp; sometimes i win. sometimes i don't. blogged with the flock browser i wish this wasn't a part of my day. i'm running sng for the orange county bureau at the amber dubois memorial. monsters do exist in our world. stories like this happen and i know it's true. posted via email from befrank's posterous i'm not working the oscars this weekend, so maybe i'll take some time to actually go to the movies.&nbsp; either i haven't been motivated to see much this year or there really hasn't been much i've wanted to see. i kind of think it was that second thing.&nbsp; also, i've been pretty busy with work (don't get me started on the family stuff). way back last monday, i got sent down to san diego to follow the night search activities in the chelsea king disappearance.&nbsp; she was still missing at the time.&nbsp; an initial arrest had been made, but her body hadn't been found yet. it was pretty grim.&nbsp; sure, all the news people talked and socialized a bit in the area where we were all parked.&nbsp; still, it just seemed like a dark and depressive evening. we were pretty close to the same area where david westerfield and the parents of danielle van dam lived.&nbsp; danielle van dam was a nine year old girl that westerfield was convicted of abducting and murdering. reporter greg mills and i had a simple story to put together for the ten and eleven o'clock newscasts.&nbsp; there wasn't much to see from the media area that had been set up.&nbsp; there also weren't a lot of people around to question. most of the people we had access to were friends and family of the missing girl and for the most part they weren't willing to be interviewed on camera. that makes our job a lot more difficult. one friend of the family told us off-camera that they were still holding out hope that chelsea would be found alive. i learned the next day that chelsea's body had been recovered from a shallow grave near the area of the search. that was my monday. it's been a week of ups and downs. i'm still standing, but very happy that today is friday.&nbsp; i see an ice cold beer in my future. blogged with the flock browser just a quick update. i'm in hollywood hoping for a celebrity or two. covering arrivals at a "green" carpet event. posted via email from befrank's posterous while passing through temecula on the way to a story that will not likely end well, we saw this at a gas station. it made me smile. i'm thankful for that. i'm guessing there won't be many more of those tonight. -- sent from my blackberry posted via email from befrank's posterous it's been a busy week.&nbsp; i&nbsp; could be posting a bit more, but most of the things i'd be inclined to write about aren't really news or photography related. just so you know where i've been and what i've been working on, i'll try to post a few pictures and do some small bit of writing to put things in context. these shots were taken out at huntington beach because the city decided to remove a bunch of the fire pits that line the beach. i was working with suzie suh that night and i'll be honest.&nbsp; i didn't think we were going to find anybody out using the fire pits.&nbsp; the weather forecast was calling for rain, plus it's winter.&nbsp; who in their right mind heads down to the beach in the rain in the cold of winter? no people?&nbsp; that would have made the story a bit more difficult to cover. as you can see from the previous pictures, there were people out making fires. the rain didn't hit as hard as i thought it might, but i did get caught by a light sprinkle. the rain chased away most of the bon fire bugs.&nbsp; we were left with drunken young people who might not have been old enough to be out drinking. at least they stayed close to their fire and pretty much ignored us. i'm kind of glad we were out doing this story now and that it wasn't a warm summer night.&nbsp; i'm pretty sure we would have gotten more attention if that were the case. it was too cold and wet to screw with the media. blogged with the flock browser 
Male: 100%, Male,  light bob blends effortlessly into his surroundings, bossu wood, quatre bras 1815. "i fight for the one true king...king jesus!" there's a few things that really capture my imagination about the english civil war. i love the look of the buff coated troopers of both sides with their lobster pot helmets and breastplates. also the massive, almost out of proportion pistols of the time really appeal to me. this grim faced veteran of cromwell's 'iron sides' knows why he fights this war and has trusted his faith to god to see it through. wellington's imfamous army. i think for the other command bases i will just mix up a bit of green stuff rather than the tricky poly filler. the results will be the same and a lot easier to achieve. for the command base i tried something a little different. knowing how poly filler can crack and flake when dry, i gave it a wash of pva glue to fix it. it was quite time consuming but for command bases i don't mind pushing the boat out a little. gloss varnish was mixed with scorched brown and a little black to make the wet looking mud. i made small hoof and footprints in the poly filler with a brush and dry brushed with shades of brown. here is the first of my three command bases. to make it a bit more enjoyable for myself i painted them one at a time rather than en mass. this allows me to see the results a lot quicker and is more satisfying. i tried a few things out and settled for the quickest and easiest way, with so many bases to flock it had to be something effective but fast to do. this involved flocking the base as normal but as the pva was still wet, i pushed a brush loaded with brown paint into it to make footprints. puddles were created by exposing the flat base underneath, when this is painted dark brown and gloss varnished, it will give the effect of a muddy puddle. very quick and very easy. 
Female: 100%, Female, julia has a friend who started keeping bees four or five years ago. the friend had four hives. almost as soon as she started on this hobby, a crisis occurred - her house burned in a really bad fire. so the bees have lived in her backyard for four years with nobody taking care of them. the friend invited julia (my partner at blue heron) to come and salvage these hives. julia in turn invited me, dangling the possibility that if there were live bees we might each get a hive out of it. we decided that if we did get hives, we would probably put them at blue heron or at the new little nancy creek park where i have asked that we be the beekeepers.the first hive was dead and empty of everything. all of the wax had been eaten out by wax moths. new wax had been built in the hives but it was abandoned. there were wax moth cocoons under the inner cover and the hive was dead. probably the original bees had died and a swarm moved in (making the new wax) and then either absconded or died as well.

;-) (left: by david hull , right: by christian kinzler , lower: by marce garal ) please don't read this post as a criticism of the photos/photographers actually published. most were indeed camera tosses and many quite interesting to look at. i just feel the methodology for coming up with the content in the first place left a little bit to be desired in the way of substance and professionalism. many jpg articles were great back in the days before they restructured , and some of them continue to be quite good, but i came away from this feeling like they just needed some space filler? which, in itself is fine, but if you wish to showcase a technique, you should either give some great instructions or display some top quality work (ideally both?). why else would you publish it, unless, perhaps your only aim is to make your own contributors (a.k.a. paying subscribers) feel good about themselves? so three cheers to derek and heather for honoring our little niche of the photography universe with their original article, instructions, and interviews! (view online here ) this second time around? not so much. as for the current editorial staff of jpg magazine. if you wish to produce "fresh" content. figure out a way to get your article/theme contributors to do their homework. a little tried and true journalism wouldn't hurt either. i'm sure you would have had an amazing spread if you popped into our forums and solicited the community to contribute (exactly what was done for the issue 6 article ). how's that for "getting fresh with you" ? ;-) maybe by fresh you didn't mean "snarky". oh well. ;-) links related to this posting: photo challenge: camera toss (and all submissions) photo challenge: camera toss (published contact-sheet) jpg magazine issue 16 unpublished jpg user contributed howto jpg magazine issue 6 article (instructions, interviews, commentary) camera toss group on flickr --- camera toss (the blog) feed source http://cameratoss.blogspot.com created and maintained by: ryan gallagher and now for a long... long... long overdue selection of photos from the camera toss photo pool over at flickr. i realize this blog has been sorely out of date, and sorely off topic, for months now... and for that i apologize. that doesn't deter the great camera tossing experimenters and the submissions to the pool just keep coming. congratulations especially to those new members shown here. authors: hover to view author screen name, or click to visit their photo on flickr. copyright: all photographs are copyright the respective authors. to view individual copyright notices click the photo and proceed to the photo's page at flickr. --- camera toss (the blog) feed source http://cameratoss.blogspot.com created and maintained by: ryan gallagher 
Female: 100%, Female,  1887 “mind you stay together, you lot! make sure you’re back before it gets dark and don’t go far! you hear?” “yes, mam,” echoed the trio of children huddled around the door of the small terraced house before setting off down the street and making their way to the lane leading up to sky pond, their tongues wagging and jam jars clanging when their clogs made contact with the cobblestones. half way up the lane, the mood changed as the rules for the afternoon were laid down. “we don’t want any whinging from you, our gracie!” the tallest boy snapped, pointing a bony finger into the chest of the frail-looking girl in front of him. his other arm lay limply by his side. “if me and our bunny find a docker and want to share it, we will. if you go telling our mam, we’ll have yer guts fer garters!” “i know better than to tell me mam, alan,” gracie snapped back at him. “i’ve still got the bruises from last time!” “right then. don’t say i haven’t warned yer.“ “don’t think gracie should be going up hades on her own. it might rain,” the younger boy quipped hesitantly. “it might rain? it might bloody rain? listen, soft lad, it might rain every blinking day! like our dad says, if it ain’t raining it’s just about to!” the face of the younger brother flashed as red as his hair and gracie came to his aid. “don’t worry about me, bunny. i’ll be fine. i only want to go up t’stones and dance with the fairies fer a few minutes. i’ll be straight back down,” she bent down to his level and gave him a reassuring smile. bunny gave her a reluctant one in return. “yer can come with me, if yer want?” gracie added, wide-eyed. “he not going chasing fairies, ” proclaimed alan sarcastically. “he’ll turn into one -– he’s already half way there! he’s coming with me -– i need him ter help me catch the taddies.” bunny’s face crumpled when he heard alan’s words. he wiped his nose across the sleeve of his threadbare jumper several times and then hitched up his short patched trousers. “right, make yersel’ scarce, gracie,” ordered alan, walking on and dragging bunny by his clean sleeve. “up ter top, five minutes and straight back down to meet us by t’pond.” “righty ho,” said gracie, breaking away from them and giving bunny a wave. “an’ don’t be late!” shouted alan. “or i’ll...” “have me guts fer garters!” shouted gracie, pulling a funny face that only bunny caught sight of. she started running, laughing with excitement as she did so and occasionally turned around to watch the minute figures of alan and bunny trotting off in the opposite direction towards the deep black sparkle of sky pond. part way up, gracie lost sight of her brothers and sat down on the gorse and heather-clad hillside and surveyed the mill town at its foot. the crowd of smoking giant chimneys of the cotton mills below reminded her of the dragon that st. george must have fought in the pace egg play. she shuddered. it was no secret how hard it was in those mills. her older sister katie had aged years since she’d started work there. and now that gracie was ten, she only had a couple of months to go before she would join her, as alan’s gammy arm had prevented him from taking his turn first. she wished she could be like miss annabella templeton and go to school until she was grown up, or be a doll like lady caroline theawicke! mind you, she didn’t want the curse that lady caroline had to live with, no way! she would rather be friends with fairies than devils! perhaps ma crabtree was right when she’d read her mam’s tea leaves last week. “there will be no mill for gracie!” maybe she would be lucky and fall for a job as a servant instead? a dark cloud passed overhead and gracie looked up. bunny was right, it looked like rain. she smiled when she noticed the full moon in the afternoon light -– there would be fairies today -– definitely! she ran on gaily. --- panic swept the whole street. men stood on the corners talking earnestly, women sobbed silently so as to not scare the children. they were all scared though. every last one of them. young grace regan had gone missing up on hades hill and her brothers claimed she was away with the fairies! ma crabtree believed them, as did many of the older members of the community, such as fanny parkinson who had gone through the tor ring backwards when she had failed to conceive after eight years of marriage. ma had told her what to do and her belly had been full within the year. fanny’s child had the ability to see things others couldn’t, too, just like ma. ma waited for the knock at the door -– she knew they would come. when the hilltop had been searched and no body had been discovered, they would seek her out and she would tell them what they already knew but didn’t want to believe -– not yet. after a while, she knew they would want to believe it for anything would be better than thinking the child was dead. mind you, she had seen it in the cups and had told the mother that there would be no mill for gracie! the mother had taken it that another occupation would call instead, but ma had a good idea at the time that it had something to do with the stones. she hadn’t expected them to take the child away though, it had been a long time since that had happened. since before her time. the knock came, just as she knew it would. she put the kettle on and answered the door. they already knew where gracie had gone, but they had to hear it from someone else, someone who knew about these things. next prev 1967 elizabeth ran down market street and turned into cotton row. she needed to be quick -– super quick. her mother knew exactly how long it should take her to do the errand. even if there was a queue in the co-op it should not take more than twenty minutes, any longer and she would be straight after her. she looked up at the grey stone building. all the previous times she had passed it she had never paid it much attention. funny that, because the building looked just like something out of a fairytale. it was so easy to imagine rapunzel sitting at the turreted window. from where elizabeth stood, she could clearly see two entrances. she much preferred the grand entrance with the door that looked as though it belonged to a castle, but her granddad had specifically said that she should go in the side one. elizabeth was fascinated by the stained glass in the window of the side entrance door. she could make out angels, flowers and animals. she wished she had the time to look at it in more detail but she didn’t have a second to spare. breathless she rushed inside. elizabeth stared hard. the man standing before her looked like a real live angel! he even sounded like tiny chimes; she was positive that the vague tinkling she could hear was coming from him. she studied him closely. his long blond hair fell loosely to his shoulders, like prince charming in her storybooks at home. this must be the “tash fellow” her granddad had told her she might see. she continued to stare wide eyed and panic started to rise in her. there was no way she was going to get the words out in time, make it to the shop, and make it back home again. there was no way! “don’t be frightened,” tashriel said, walking towards her. i don’t bite. he smiled and elizabeth continued to stare. she felt him touch her on the shoulder. “is that better?” “yes, thank you,” she heard herself say, gasping for breath. “i’ll have to be quick, i’ve only got ten minutes to tell you and i have got to get to the shop and back home. i think i’ve used nine minutes already! my mum will go mad if i’m late back and...,” she stopped for breath as he raised his hand. “no need to worry, elizabeth, there is plenty of time. i promise you that you will be home with minutes to spare.” elizabeth blinked several times and continued staring. he really was very pretty. “so, now that we know why you are here, and...” “but i haven’t told you yet!” elizabeth interrupted. “i’ve got a message for you from me granddad and...” “yes i know,” tashriel replied softly. “i knew what your message was as soon as you came in and i asked a friend of mine to go and fetch your granddad and meet us both here. we’ve been searching for your granddad for a long time and now he has found us again. he’s waiting for us with my friend stanley in another room. come with me.” he held his hand out to her and elizabeth placed her small one within it. “let’s go and join them and have some tea.” --- lady mabel theawicke watched as the child and tashriel left the red reception room at royds. “it will be for the best if you stay away from elizabeth from now on,” she remarked, looking sternly at the man sitting in front of the fireplace with stanley. billy nodded. he could still feel the weight of the child on his lap where she had been sitting earlier. it was almost like she had left a little imprint on his presence. he sighed. he liked the kid, she had done him a big favour, but he didn’t need her any more. besides, he had to go back before midnight. that was the bargain with annwn and he had no choice but to stick with it. “so, you have no idea what happened to your body, only that it’s somewhere in the dell?” stanley asked, passing billy a cigarette and lighting it for him. billy inhaled deeply. by heck that’s grand “should imagine so,” replied billy offhandedly looking off into space and then back at stanley. “i’m not mithered, you know. it makes no difference to me. unless some fucking hopper’s running about in it! i shouldn’t imagine it though? you would have heard about that by now if they was, wouldn’t you?” stanley nodded. “well then, best it stays where it is. it’s obviously well hidden. i’ve no need for it either. i suspect after all these years the earth has already reclaimed it. best thing all round if you ask me.” “so,” stanley said, sitting forward in his seat. “this gorgeous george bloke knocked you on the side of the head with some kind of object and that was it? no light, eh? and the next thing you know you are wandering around the dell twenty years later?” “that’s about it,” billy answered, taking a final drag on his cigarette and throwing it into the fire. “he died in an accident if i remember correctly,” lady mabel looked across to stanley for confirmation. “yes, he did. car crash i think... obviously, we took a great deal of interest in that outfit after your disappearance, billy. we knew something had happened to you and that the answers lay with the living. never able to get to the bottom of it, mind you. the conclusion was that you had gone directly into the light.” “aye, well who knows! probably would have done, given half the chance! anything would have been a damned site better than that place i ended up in!” billy shivered and gazed blankly at his knees. stanley reached out and patted his shoulder. “i remember he married cora woods and they had quite a handful of children. they seemed to be a good match as far as i could,” announced lady mabel as much to herself as anyone else. “well, thankfully all that’s over now and a new dawn has begun.” quipped stanley cheerfully. billy looked up and directed his question at lady mabel. “elizabeth told me that...my...anne died in 1952?” “yes, that’s correct,” replied the lady mabel, walking over to him, her long grey skirts rustling. “did she...did she ever marry again?” the mask of lady mabel’s normally emotionless face cracked a little and her cornflower blue eyes held those of billy’s firmly. “no. anne never loved any man but you, billy.” billy wiped away budding tear drops from his own eyes with the back of his hand. “aye. i loved her and all that,” he sobbed and then faded away. next prev 1967 billy watched idly as the little old woman continued to laboriously bend and pick up the few dry birch twigs that were scattered around the clearing. each stoop seemed to require twice as much effort than the last. so far, her daily foraging did not look to have been very successful. he looked up to the sky; the morning was quickly drawing in, he doubted that she would have the quantity of firewood she required to see her comfortably through the next day. billy looked towards his own pile. it had taken a strapping bloke like him half the night to come up with a bounty like that. she had no chance! billy watched as she struggled to tie her small bundle together. her hands were chapped, the fingers knotted with age. he tensed as the bushes around him rustled and a little white terrier with one red ear emerged from the undergrowth and padded up to him. he bent down to pat it and delighted with the dog’s enthusiastic response, continued to make a fuss of it. “calm down now, lad,” he said playfully, and stood up fully again. the dog reminded him of his own dog, monty. he hadn’t seen monty since...he couldn’t remember when. he looked over to where the old woman had been scavenging. she had moved on a bit, although her bundle of twigs had not grown any larger. billy had seen the old woman on many occasions but he had never seen the dog before. “best get gone now,” he ordered the dog. the dog splayed out on his belly and wagged his tail. billy smiled despite himself. “what’s up with you? eh...soft lad,” he said, unable to resist bending down and making another fuss of it. the old woman had turned around and was catching up the distance between them. billy noticed a dejected air about her and sighed. grabbing a large amount of his own prized firewood, he ran over to her, the dog following behind. “here,” he said, cheerfully thrusting the wood in the old woman’s direction. “yer may as well ‘ave this lot as well!” --- “see that tree?” elizabeth looked over to where her mother was pointing and squinting through the sunshine, and peered closely at the very boring tree situated in the tiny garden beyond the graveyard they were standing in. elizabeth nodded. my dad planted that tree when i was not much bigger than you are now. in fact, i might have been even younger. he took the pip from an apple i had eaten and planted it in the garden. “‘one day,’ he’d said, ‘there’ll be a tree here even bigger than the house.’ and we both laughed. every time i see that tree i think of my dad. some people believe that as long as a person is remembered, they never die.” margaret smiled down at elizabeth and ruffled her hair. elizabeth looked at the colourful flowers carefully arranged in the vase beside the black marble headstone and the names carved upon it. 1952, that was in the olden days! her mother must have been very young when her mum had died. elizabeth felt sad thinking about it. “we’ll call in there and have a nice cup of tea with mrs bibby, shall we? see how she is?” margaret said encouragingly to elizabeth. “if you’re a good girl, we can call and have a toasted teacake for tea at the myna bird cafe!” elizabeth smiled brightly and skipped along the cobbled rake leading down from the graveyard and into the town square. --- elizabeth concentrated on not staring at the grey whiskers on mrs bibby’s chin. it would be such a disaster if she missed out on a visit to see the myna bird. “why don’t you go and play outside, dearie? it’s such a lovely day and plenty of juicy apples have fallen off that tree today. have a look and see if any of them are worth taking home with you!” “yes, mrs bibby,” she said in her best voice and skipped out of the tiny kitchen into the garden beyond. most of the apples had tiny worms in them. elizabeth giggled to herself; the worms always looked so funny wriggling about. her dad always told her it was because apples were used to make cider and the worms were drunk. the warmer the day, the drunker the worms! these ones were steaming. nobody likes me everybody hates me “i think i’ll go and eat worms!” elizabeth sang out. big fat juicy ones eensie weensy squeensy ones “see how they wiggle and squirm!” elizabeth giggled. “what’s your name?” “i’m not supposed to talk to strangers!” elizabeth pouted at the man sitting on the grass beside her. “i’m not really a stranger.” elizabeth tilted her head to one side. “well, in that case, if you’re not a stranger, you tell me my name!” she said cheekily. the man laughed. “you got me there! is that your mum in there? i think that’s your mum in there because that’s my girl -– that’s my little girl...maggie.” he answered looking through the kitchen widow and gazing into the room beyond. “not so!” elizabeth said standing up and putting her hands on her hips. “that’s my mummy and her name’s margaret, not maggie!” she stuck her tongue out at him and then screwed up her face. “so there!” the stranger also got up onto his feet. “margaret is her sunday name but she was always my maggie. see this tree here?” elizabeth nodded wide eyed. “well, i planted this tree when it were a little tiny seed like this one here,” he said, picking up another apple and plucking the seed from it. “if you want, we can plant this seed over here and when you grow up it will be bigger than this house!” he walked over to the far corner of the garden and waited for her to join him. “my name is elizabeth,” she announced gaily. “what’s yours?” “billy. you can call me granddad if you want.” elizabeth smiled and nodded. “elizabeth’s a sunday name. how about i call you our bess? ” next prev refuge of delayed souls ebooks are free during read an ebook week which runs from 7 - 10 march 2010 use coupon code rfree at the checkout. vol one ~ royds vol two ~ billy enjoy :) 1946 “staibey nayes?” “that’s right. they’ve moved out lock, stock and barrel. heard say now the war is over there’s other places more suited to what they need. heard they didn’t much like it anyways, spooked by the dell. its inhabitants more like -- after all those scare-stories we’ve been spreading round!” raucous laughter spread throughout the pub like wildfire. billy looked at his cards. he could win this round. switch, the twenty stone king of crime, was in a good mood for a change. billy put out his cigarette and took a sip of his pint. “it’ll work out well for storage and also be a good place to hang out when the heat’s on. that swine allen’s still got a face like a bulldog licking piss off a nettle despite all the readies we’re bunging him. heard he has quite a grudge against you, billy -– been shagging his wife or summat?” blade asked, throwing a ten shilling note into the pot of coins and notes already on the table. the infectious laughter echoed around the room and billy joined in. he didn’t mind being the brunt of it, not tonight anyway. not when he was on a winning streak. he placed his aces on the table. “not yet!” he said coolly and lit a fresh cigarette. switch studied him keenly and then burst out laughing. “not yet! not bloody yet! i like his style!” he pushed the money in the pot over to billy and then continued in a more serious tone, “what’s he got against you, billy? apart from the fact that you are a lying, cheating little shit.” switch leaned in and held billy’s gaze a fraction longer than necessary. “but then again -– aren’t we all?” he quipped, leaning back and pulling his braces forward. the room exploded once more. billy casually collected his winnings off the table and put them in his inside jacket pocket. he made a mental note to give ann a bob or two of it to spend on herself and the kiddies. that was if he had any left after he had finished paying his dues and put aside what he needed for his fags, beers and bets next week. he drained his glass and passed it to the vivacious cora who, as usual, was hovering enticingly nearby. “a few year back i gave his mother one,” replied billy in a deadpan manner, inhaling deeply on his cigarette and blowing a smoke circle into the room. switch actually looked like he believed him. “i’ve no idea,” he added quickly with half a smile. “he’s just a nasty piece of work.” “you can say that again,” said gorgeous george from where he stood, leaning against the bar leering at cora as she walked past with her hands full of dirty glasses. billy ogled cora too. been there “right, gentleman! time to say good night and thanks for donating to the house of lawrence. same time, same place, tomorrow.” billy kicked his chair back and stood up. “not tomorrow,” switch looked up at him. “i want you to deliver that last load down to the nayes. have it there for 10:00 p.m. mark my words now, lad.” billy nodded and walked away, stopping briefly on his way out to have a quiet word and squeeze with cora at the bar. the opportunity to mark his territory was too tempting for billy to resist. --- the road leading down to staibey nayes was accessed from the far side of town. it was tree lined, had no street lights and was wide enough for only a single vehicle to manoeuvre at any one time. the road continued for about three-quarters of a mile and to a stranger would seem to come to an end in a wood which appeared on the horizon beyond. a local, however, knew that just before the end of the road was reached, it branched off to the right and opened onto a building complex. during the war, the entrance to the complex had been barred by a gated sentry box which had been manned by two fully armed security guards at any one time. tonight, though, the gate was open and the chain and padlock were tossed to the side of the road. the buildings had existed centuries before the war. for a period of time before war broke out, they had served as a depot for the engines which carried the stone through the dell from the quarries above. prior to that, they were warehouses for the cloth made in the cotton mills close by and before that still, a local wool merchant had built his mansion here. ever since records began, there had been buildings in the location of staibey nayes. billy had learned that at school when they had been taught about the doomsday book. billy expected to get a good cut from tonight’s load. he had no compunction about fuelling the black market. after all, they were only supplying a demand and someone had to do it. if it wasn’t them it would be someone else. billy had expected to see other vehicles in the empty quadrant. he pulled up and parked the stolen lorry, and then checked his watch: 21:55. there was still time for a cigarette. he opened the cab door of the lorry and stepped outside into the cold night air. after transferring his cigarettes and matches into his trouser pocket, he threw his jacket and scarf back inside the cab despite the chill. the wind blew up and whistled through the trees, carrying the sweet scent of night blossoms and the call of an owl. billy tried to decipher which part of the dell the sound had come from. the silhouette of the leafless trees against the raw black and twinkling night sky caught his attention and he leaned his head back and tried to decipher his favourite constellation, the plough. the moment was spoilt when the door of the building to his right was opened and gorgeous george waved him over. both men worked up a sweat carrying the cargo from the lorry into the building where gorgeous had been waiting. billy also worked up quite a temper. he was raging that no one else had been there to help them. he wasn’t anyone’s fucking monkey! switch should know better than to waste his time and sweat on shifting this crap. eventually, the job was done and billy followed gorgeous back into the building to collect his earnings for the night’s hard work. he couldn’t wait to get his hands on that wad of cash! gorgeous walked through the former office where they had stacked the goods and into the one beyond, where billy could see a black holdall resting on a makeshift desk. billy lit himself a well-deserved cigarette and as he waited for gorgeous to get the money together, he walked over to the window to continue his earlier aborted search for the plough. fuck he threw his cigarette on the floor and stomped it out viciously. standing against a dry stone wall near to the parked lorry below was a young woman in a red coat, looking up at him. shocked, he watched dumbfounded as she turned and seemed to be intent on something that was happening in the dell beyond. billy turned to let gorgeous know about their unexpected visitor and felt the impact of a heavy metal object. billy fell to the ground and into a vicious kick from the boot of gorgeous george. “not so fucking handsome now, are you, billy boy?” --- billy was in the water, charlie was crying out in the distance. billy swam out to meet him. again and again peg stood between billy and michael, her eyes wide and pleading. billy lifted his rifle and pulled the trigger. again and again cora moaned softly into billy’s ear, her breasts pressed tightly against his chest. anne walked in and caught them. again and again billy treaded water as the incendiaries came down and screams echoed around him. you’re going to hell, lawrence “i’m already fucking there!” he screamed. next prev 2008 “linus howell,” announced stanley perplexed. “i would recognise him anywhere,” said elizabeth with an involuntary shudder. it was the first time they had all been together in one place for as long as elizabeth could remember. stanley had gathered together his war cabinet. the group of them were crowded around a large circular table in the red reception room at royds. wilfred was busying stacking coals on the already roaring fire behind them. “kelly crabtree is sitting in a classroom up at the college and all of his other victims are walking around as large as... life, ” added paul. “it’s as if his crimes never happened! of course we know differently, but somehow howell, or someone... something else, has managed to bewitch the living into believing otherwise.” elizabeth noted the concerned looks around the room before shifting her attention towards gemma who had placed herself in between tashriel and grispheran. much to elizabeth’s annoyance, the latter was sitting sideways against the table his own attention also focussed firmly upon gemma who was flirting with him outlandishly. “then there is only one explanation i can offer,” said stanley, lighting a cigar. “whatever ed lord uncovered up at heyleigh stones has magical properties. it would appear that we need to recover it and return it to where it belongs without further delay. “agreed,” said tashriel almost as if he was speaking for all of them. lady mabel leaned forward, placed her elbows on the table and the palms of her hands together as if in prayer. when she had everyone’s attention, including gemma and grispheran’s, she spoke with authority. “the last time something like this happened...” “was in 1946 when we first lost poor mr lawrence,” interrupted wilfred standing up from the fireplace and walking towards them. “ah, wilfred,” said stanley twisting in his chair and looking over his shoulder to get a view of him. “would you like to join us?” he nodded towards the empty chair beside paul. the coal dust disappeared from wilfred’s hands as he joined them at the table and produced a delicious looking display of cakes upon a silver platter. “mr lawrence?” asked elizabeth quizzically. “ billy lawrence?” “the very one, miss,” confirmed wilfred. “i did have a soft spot for mr lawrence, miss. dare say he reminded me of myself in some ways...” “quite,” said stanley in an attempt to bring them back on track again. “we can’t talk about that little episode now -– we haven’t got time. by the way, has anyone actually noticed the time by any chance?” all eyes focussed on the edwardian clock ticking merrily upon the black marble mantelpiece. “what about it?” asked gemma. “the clock looks to be working fine to me.” “always does, miss,” replied wilfred reassuringly. “then what are we looking at?” questioned paul. “11 a.m.,” announced archie solemnly. “and totally dark outside!” next prev 1946 the safe job had been easy enough. billy was aware that the police suspected he had been involved somehow. he also knew that if they could, they would fit him up for just about anything. the newly promoted sergeant allen in particular was a nasty piece of work. takes one to know one switch had been fair with billy up until now, so he had no complaints. he had initially misjudged gorgeous george and dan the man -– they were a bit barmy, mean to be sure, but not bad with it. you knew where you were with them and the consequences of crossing them, he could handle that. so far, there had been the one explosives job, a few lorry heists and a huge amount of black market profiteering. his little side job with royds was proving to be a good number too -– money for old rope. he wondered what they had in store for him this time as he walked up to the now familiar open oak door and stepped inside. “afternoon, mr lawrence. dark out isn’t it?” wilfred never changed. billy wished he would take the stick out from up his arse and cut the brownnosing. “stanley in?” he asked, throwing wilfred his coat and starting off down the passageway. “as a matter of fact, sir, lady mabel would like a word with you this morning. you will find her in the office, sir, first door on the left.” lady mabel! he had yet to have the pleasure! he whistled merrily to himself as he continued down the opulent cobalt blue-decorated corridor and waltzed into the more practical office, usually reserved for unsuspecting members of the living who required the services of royds. --- “you want me to what?” billy snarled, closing the distance between them. “where the hell do you get the idea that i would do something like that? what do you think i am -– your lap-dog?” he was furious. jumped up little tart billy stopped thinking when his back slapped against the wall behind him and his head smashed up against the ceiling. a split second later the door slammed furiously open and shut leaving him alone in the room. he looked down, the view was just like he suspected it would be from this angle -– not that he had ever given it much thought, mind you. he would probably break a bone or two if he just fell to the floor and said a silent prayer that whatever power was keeping him up would let him down slowly. tashriel appeared in the room below and billy found himself standing by his side. “silver.” “what?” asked billy exasperatedly, brushing the plaster from his made-to-measure navy suit and exercising his neck in an attempt to ease the newly acquired crick in it. “silver. offers no protection against your own kind, but if you carry some on your person, lady mabel -- and other factions -- will not be able to harm you. i doubt lady mabel intended you any real harm. you are still breathing.” smarmy pretty boy “and who would you be then?” billy replied sarcastically. “someone she just mistook me for?” “i could always put you back up there if you prefer,” tashriel volunteered, looking up at the space billy had so recently occupied. calmer now, billy considered tashriel’s offer. “er...no thanks!” he pulled a packet of cigarettes from his inside pocket and helped himself to one before offering the packet to tashriel. “i know that stanley enjoys a fag,” he said hesitatively. tashriel politely declined. “what was it about lady mabel’s request that enraged you?” “i’m no cold blooded murderer!” snapped billy in reply, removing the lit cigarette from his mouth. “seems to me that witch is quite capable of doing the deed herself!” tashriel sighed, “as i said, keep something silver on you at all times to prevent it happening in future. better still, try to get control of your temper.” something about tashriel’s tone brought billy to his senses. “aye. suppose you’re right.” “besides, you are simply being asked to contain a situation,” tashriel remarked casually. “the real john sweeney is already dead -– your role is merely to evict the entity that is squatting in his body. --- it had been drizzling all day, perhaps all week, he couldn’t remember. billy wondered if it would ever stop and, upon further consideration, whether it was possible for an entire town to weep. personally, he had no time for tears. as far as he was concerned, they would not serve any purpose and only distract from the job at hand. he buttoned up his navy overcoat, pulling the collar up as far as possible as he did so. casting his eyes down towards the grey flagstone pavement, he took the identity of a grey man amongst other grey people. the house was straight ahead. it was not his first visit here; he had recce’d the place on several occasions at various times of the day and night. he knew exactly where he was heading -– some would say straight to hell. he had no doubt that he would be on the guest list if such a place existed. nearly there now, he unbuttoned his overcoat, turned off his wandering thoughts and went into autopilot mode. he knocked on the door and it was answered almost immediately. 
Female: 100%, Female, what?!?! more cupcakes? where are the drawings and sewings and art, alicia?' you say.'psshaw!' say i. ' i had to make them! they're brain slugs. i have no choice.'and so this past weekend, i made some futurama brain slug cupcakes for a birthday celebration. we needed something that could travel to the pub, be delicious, be to the birthday boy's liking in terms of content, and fairly quick and easy to make, just like last year's zappa utility muffins.i opted to make the brain slugs themselves from gum paste, with royal icing eyes, and flower stamen antennae that i attempted to dye green with food coloring (and very vaguely succeeded in doing so). they are vanilla cupcakes from scratch, with some slightly grenadine flavored buttercream icing brains. and they were as tasty as the sweet, sweet fluids the brain slugs crave themselves!
Female: 100%, Female,  because you can never have too much yarn porn. january 1, i started a 365 photo-a-day project. and, in consultation with many of your good selves, i created a&nbsp; flickr group &nbsp;to support it and for us to have a place to share our photos and give feedback to one another, with the idea of improving our photography. in the initial, heady days of january, it was so much fun! it seemed like the year would fly by and the inspiration would continue to flow like a fountain. all these people who knew one another from the blogosphere and a few new ones joined in and we became friends. and everyone learned and made explore and was happy. then february struck. most of those in the group live in the northern hemisphere, so it was the darkest, coldest, most dreary part of the winter and it was hard. now it's march and spring is taking its sweet time in coming, at least where i live. there are days when i look outside at the aging snowbanks and the bare trees and i think, "i can't possibly take a &nbsp;picture of anything worthwhile today." but then i take a wander around the house or i look at the photos the others in the group have taken and i feel inspired by something someone else photographed, and i get through it. because i promised myself i would. and my promises to myself have to mean something. and you reach a point where you keep doing it because it's hard and because doing things that are hard can be good for you, and because it makes you buy fresh flowers on a regular basis. my reasons for doing this have already changed in the 75 days it's been running. at the beginning, if i'm &nbsp;honest, i wanted to show off my ability to take breathtaking pictures and develop more consistency in that. now, i realize that such a project is more about documenting what's going on in my life. and i admit that it's most decidedly not breathtaking on a daily basis. some days, i use my iphone (thank goodness i've got&nbsp; hipstamatic and camerabag and other apps to make that more interesting). when the weather gets good, i'm going to use some of my film cameras (they're best at outdoor photos). i realized that a profound macro of the inside of my cat's ear doesn't actually help me document my life on a daily basis, so i've worked at pushing myself away from those and towards things that will help me remember what was going on and what was important to me at a particular moment in time. i think ultimately i'll find that this project is about memory for me. the other reason i did this was to be more mindful of the world around me. to notice things. to see differently. last year at about this time, i got on a total eyeball kick , which i later realized was about my wanting to see differently. having to take a photo every day makes me look differently at the world. i'll admit it's hard for me not to see the current exodus from the group as a personal rejection of sorts, despite endless explanations to the contrary, but i'm trying. and until i can forget about it, that's all i can do.in the meantime, it makes me quite sad to see people give up and leave us, whatever their reasons. but although i'll admit it shakes my conviction, especially because it's people i love and respect, i remain committed. after all, i read recently about a guy who took a picture every single day from 1979 'til his death in 1997. now that's commitment. if you're not now totally put off the idea of taking a photo every day and you'd like to join us, please check out the blog camp 365 group on flickr. it's never too late to start! - - - and the picture at the top? what does it have to do with all of this? well, it was one of those days, where i took what felt like 600 pictures of the new yarn that i'm going to use to make granny squares after kristina and ulrika teach me this coming weekend, and i wasn't pleased with how any of them turned out. but then, i played with them in lightroom and i think this one came out ok. a process that was good for me and which framboesa talks about very thoughtfully here . yesterday, in the flickr group, kristine had a shot of her passport and used it to tell the story of how she was soon moving on to her next assignment. i didn't have any idea what i was going to do for my photo, so i did one of those tribute shots , as they're called when you blatantly copy what someone did and give them credit. i located my old passport and my current one and, as can often be the case with these daily photos, took a little trip down memory lane. old on the left, current on the right my passports are fatter than your usual passport. and that's because both of them have had pages added to them. twice. you'll also notice that my old passport was green. it was my first one and i didn't know that most americans have a blue one. i was "lucky" and got the green one during a very small window when they issued ben franklin commemorative passports. it's actually thanks to benjamin franklin that we all have passports at all, as it was his idea. the unusual green passport caused me no end of grief when i was traveling a lot in the balkans in the late 90s. border guards constantly questioned its authenticity and one guard at the turkish-greek border actually said, "green passport, very bad, very bad," and made a slicing motion across his neck. i was quite alarmed, but the conversation stopped there as that was apparently the extent of his english and my turkish was nonexistent. i've survived to tell the tale, so i guess it wasn't really very bad. and i never did ever meet anyone else with a green one. as an american, you get stamped everywhere you go and you often need visas. the first passport filled up because the macedonian visa took a whole page every time and i had to have a new one if i popped down to thessaloniki for a weekend or up to belgrade for a coffee. it was early days after macedonia found themselves, rather to their surprise, with their own country, and it took them awhile to realize they could issue multiple-entry visas. i eventually got one of those, but not before they had used up ten pages of my passport. a number of countries - china and india come to mind - think nothing of taking up an entire page of your passport for the visa. and the visas are elaborately colorful and often feature shiny holograms. i guess they want you to feel you got your money's worth. on the bright side, they're usually good for a least six months, so you don't need a new one should you be sent those places again. &nbsp;i did use up two whole pages on indian visas, as i had to go there frequently enough that one expired and i needed another. (audible sigh.) the bulk of my travel occurred during the bush administration and i clearly remember standing in lines at passport control, concealing my passport, as i felt a little sheepish about being american during those years. i happened to be in the philippines when obama was elected and i very clearly remember the sense of relief (tho' bush was still president) when i realized that i no longer had to hide my passport while i stood in line. on that occasion, people in line saw it and several actually smiled and gave me a thumbs up. with the incomprehensible debacle of health care reform (who would seriously not want to limit the influence of insurance companies on their personal health?) going on in the us right now, i'm not sure i wouldn't actually begin to conceal my passport again if i were queuing today. many of the pages are covered in stamps that say "københavn" because i get stamped every time i come back into the country if it's not from scandinavia or the schengen countries. it tapered off because eventually, i knew all of the guys at passport control and convinced them to not to stamp me every time. i've loved the travel opportunities i've had through my various jobs. the job i'm starting in april will not have so many travel opportunities, but i've been thinking about it and i'm really ok with that. looking at all of these stamps exhausts me a little bit. when i see the dates for the convoluted trip i took from copenhagen to singapore to heathrow to gatwick to budapest to constanza and back to copenhagen in one crazy week, it makes me tired. i hope companies today are using the possibilities afforded by electronic meeting software, rather than sending someone to give a 30 minute presentation in singapore on monday and the same one in romania on wednesday. i remember thinking it was all very exciting at the time (tho' having to switch from heathrow to gatwick was madness and an example of how bad the travel agent was). but today, i wouldn't even want to do it. and i would probably have the good sense to say no, but in those days (sounds like long ago, but it's not even three years ago), i actually quite liked it and of course, felt i had to do all of the things that were asked of me. these stamps document for me how far i've come not just literally, but metaphorically as well. i think i've learned to say no to such madness today. and i hope that one good thing to come out of economic crisis is that employees aren't asked to do trips like that these days, because companies think twice before spending 40,000 ($7,300) kroner on such a ticket. i'm going to lose my gold status on both sas and klm here in the next couple of months. and tho' there was a time, not so long ago, when that would have panicked me, i'm resting quite easily in the knowledge. the world is changing and times are changing and it's no longer environmentally defensible to pop over to london for lunch or take a private plane back from newcastle like we did in the mid-noughties. i loved those times and am grateful for all the places i've been, but i'm quite ready to stay a bit closer to home for awhile. and besides, taking the train down through europe is quite romantic. ~ i miss being in an academic environment. i miss the thrill of reading a really dense sentence and pulling meaning out of it that applies the world around me. i think it's why i used quotes from susan sontag's on photography on my 365 project photos during february . ~ husband looks like an entirely new person in his new glasses (must photograph him soon). but is it the glasses or his new job or our impending move giving him that glow? maybe it's all of it. ~ i learned that our new little samsung u10 hd flashcam can't really handle filming in the dimly-lit riding hall. ~ note: the flashcam doesn't violate the "not buying things in 2010" because i actually bought it back in december, but my sister only just sent it last week. ~ cleaning out the attic is like visiting a flea market and finding all kinds of treasures, only without spending any money. who knew we had all this cool stuff? ~ if you trip over a sweet little brass deer in the yard at a house you're contemplating, it's a sign, right? and if you accidentally take that little deer with you, it's not really stealing, right? since it was abandoned out in the yard at a house that stands empty? ~ one drawback of sunshine: it exposes just how much your windows need cleaning. ~ stieg larsson is sweden's answer to dan brown. only we won't be subjected to more of his hack writing since he died. but i'll admit that i like the characters of mikael blomqvist and lisbeth salander, so i (re)read on. sometimes, you just have to read trash. but arthur koestler's the ghost in the machine is next on my nightstand, so i shall redeem myself. ~ every day after husband and sabin leave, i think that i'll go back to bed, but i never do. and soon, i won't be able to, since i'll be headed off for work in an actual office myself. ~ sometimes i wonder if others can hear that ringing in my ears. ~ i packed marxism and theology books in the same box this weekend and wondered aloud if i would be going to hell for that (tho' thankfully i cannot, since i don't believe in hell and it's like santa claus, if you don't believe it in, it doesn't believe in you (thanks gwen )). husband's response: "god is more of a marxist than you think." and the more we discussed it, the more i think he's right, there is something of the new testament over the communist manifesto . i wish i'd written my dissertation on that. of course, i still could, since i haven't actually written it. yet. ~ i tucked all those little end bits of yarn into my scarf last night while watching hercule poirot (who is so gay, by the way, not that there's anything wrong with that). it was much easier than i thought it would be. now i hope i can figure out how to join the ends together when the time comes to do that. ~ i really wish i was on my way to the bookstore with trinsch &nbsp;this morning. she's going to browse books on new media and then she gets to write about it. i'm so envious. it leaves me positively longing for academia. ~ i do love these little random thought downloads, they just completely clear my head and leave me feeling ready to face the week. pondering happiness quite a lot in the face of the excitement of moving to the other side of the country (which admittedly is like moving from one side of wisconsin to the other and not as big as it might sound). husband is like a little kid anticipating christmas. he actually fell asleep last night with a smile on his face. he's covering reams of paper with sketches of the possibilities for renovations. we're now betting on two horses, as it were, and have given an offer on a second place, since the dog sled transport to northern canada is apparently unreliable, or else the laid back realtor hasn't actually sent a dog sled or any thing else, as we've heard nothing regarding our first offer. not being ones to wait around, husband has now talked himself (and thereby both of us) into the second place being better anyway. and he's right, there are more possibilities for ripping out everything that's there and putting it back in as we would want it. now betting on this one as well. what's cool is that there's a lake on the property. and although the first thing it needs is a new roof, that does afford opportunities not afforded by the other place, which recently had a new roof, although the engineering calculations surrounding that new roof are openly suspect in several places. so i think husband is right, the second property is better for us anyway. but my point actually is that even just talking about all of this is making us so happy. leading me to think about what happiness is. it's an eternal question, isn't it? and we're eternally in search of happiness, tho' i'm not sure we always recognize it when we see it. for me, it's something different than contentment. contentment is a mild, tame form of happiness. a resting, easy thing. whereas, what i think makes us happy, makes us really tick, is having some enormous, seemingly impossible, daunting project on the horizon. i can definitely see that in husband. he's transformed and positively beaming at the prospect of this project. of course, it's also his new job that's transformed him - he was more than a little bored and frustrated at work and just going through the motions. he's looking forward to his new job, but even more, to the new house and all of the possibilities it represents. these projects also remind me of our strengths - i can see things in my mind and he can build them. i pick colors, he paints them. in other words, i get all the fun and he does all the work. i guess i'll probably spend another summer with no kitchen, cooking on an old stove out in the yard and eating lots of salads. maybe it'll be time to try that raw diet i've long wanted to try. perhaps it will clear my mind so that i'll make good choices on all of those colors that we'll need on the walls in the new house. whichever one it ends up being. at least the waiting paralysis of last week seems to have passed and an excited, expectant happiness has stepped in to replace it. and that makes me very happy. what made you happy this weekend? march 7 march 9 march 11 march 13 i'm especially pleased with that row of yellow. it's some yarn i bought last summer at the viking fair in roskilde. it's hand-dyed with natural plant dyes - gyldenris as it's called in danish (not sure what that is in english). &nbsp;the colors are slightly less vibrant than this in real life. i've got the saturation dialed up a notch (or two) in my camera at the moment. i should have bought the entire basket of this yarn dyed with natural plant dyes - - - &nbsp;a big congratulations to molly , my very first follower, and long lost sister in south africa.&nbsp; she just had a beautiful baby girl. latte and a fabulous norwegian cinnamon bun for stephanie of concerning: pancakes . i'm back again already with another blog crush. i told you i had more of them brewing. this time, i'm utterly charmed by stephanie's blog, c oncerning: pancakes . you may remember her from my tagging her recently for 7 random things . and while i'm hoping she doesn't actually drink bud light with her peanut m&amp;m's, i very much enjoyed her list. stephanie first came to my attention because she has also decided to spend less in 2010 (tho' i do believe she's taking a bit of a break at the moment, kinda like i did with the infamous orange coat incident). but thanks to the linkwithin widget (love it now that they improved the code and hence the speed), i also found out that she's got a tlr camera &nbsp;and likes to play with ttv photography. her cat, chairman meow , has a clever name and is cute as can be. she often blogs about cooking , which is always a plus in my book. i'm off to make her german pancakes now, since the pooka is home and feeling poorly. please do go check her out. around midmorning, right as i was putting the finishing touches on my to-do list, i got a monster headache. i blame the chocolate on toast that husband made me for breakfast. too much sugar, especially in the morning, will bring on a headache every time. it resisted all ibuprofen and the gallons of water i drank, so i finally took a nap. i couldn't even read, because it hurt too much to focus my eyes (there's that focus thing again). when sabin came home, i decided to hang out and watch project runway with her, despite the headache. while we watched the amusing catfighting and recriminations, &nbsp;i worked a bit on my knitting. and that's when i saw this little giraffe herd go by...do you think headaches can make you hallucinate? some snow melted, but not all. and hoarfrost on the trees. hurry up spring! we've been waiting and waiting all week. and we've realized that waiting bites. and instead of being productive and getting things done, the waiting paralyzes you and you stare into space and can't think straight and your arm falls asleep while you're knitting (is that supposed to happen?). you wander listlessly around the house, thinking about how much packing there is to do, but it doesn't really result in you actually doing any of it. your mind wanders off to that dog sled that should have reached that guy you want to buy the house from wherever he is in the northern reaches of canada. you talked to the realtor yesterday, but he was as laid back as his accent and not at all worried that the guy hadn't answered yet. you asked in a slightly hysterical voice if they had in fact really sent a dog sled. he pretends he knows what you're talking about and laughs. it seems that your new job will start a whole lot sooner than you thought, which is both good and bad. because you haven't used your time all that wisely and now suddenly you won't have any. but on the other hand, it will undoubtedly be good for you to dress in normal clothes, fix your hair and put on makeup and go out among people on a daily basis. your photo-a-day project may suffer and focus rather too frequently on the wind turbine just outside your new office window. but time will tell. time will tell on all of it and time takes its sweet time. so strange how it can both crawl at a snail's pace and race by in the same instant. but time is mysterious that way. and life is full of contradictions.

Female: 100%, Female,  fifteen years ago, i was on my way to the austin airport to catch a flight to new york city when the friend i’d be staying with called and said that we’d be attending a dance performance that evening in the east village. admission was free, she said, but the organizers requested a donation of two canned goods for a food pantry. so before walking out the door, i grabbed a couple of ranch style beans as my offering. ranch style beans are a texan staple and they’ve been satisfying people since 1872 with their take on classic chuck-wagon fare. it’s a distinctive flavor—the beans aren’t fiery but they do have a depth and brightness that can be very addictive. when i lived in texas, we ate them often—either topped with cheese and rice, as a base to bean salad, alongside enchiladas or even in my mom’s king ranch casserole . but beyond the deliciousness and versatility of ranch style beans, there’s the appeal of that iconic black can with its distinctive western-style font and illustration of a man with his tongue sticking out stating the beans are appetite pleasin’. (of course, the latter is a recent development for if you’re as old as i am, you remember when the beans were husband pleasin’.) i love that can and i’ve read that if andy warhol had been a texan he would have painted ranch style beans cans instead of campbell’s soup cans. i believe it. in the 15 years since i’ve moved to new york city, i’ve seen this city become more hospitable to fellow homesick texans. we now have a texan-style barbecue joint selling kreuz sausages and excellent brisket; you can find ro-tel tomatoes at several grocery stores; dried and canned chiles are a common staple; and austin-based whole foods is now here selling decent brands of tortillas, chips and salsas. but despite the advances this city’s made, there’s still one thing missing: my beloved ranch style beans. to help with the drought, every time i go home i load up on a few cans. and my mom has even been known to put them in my christmas stocking, which is always a very welcome gift. but when i recently came to my last can with no trip home in my immediate future, i realized that i should just figure out how to make these beans on my own. the recipe is a closely guarded secret, so i was flummoxed on what to do. and then i read one fan’s observation that ranch style beans are simply pintos swimming in a chili gravy. at last, it all made sense! i decided i’d cook a pot of pintos in a chili gravy and see what happened. when making my chile gravy, i used the ingredient list on the back of my remaining can as my guide. sure, there were some vague terms, such as “spices” and “natural flavor,” but the basic building blocks were in the open: tomatoes, chile peppers, paprika, vinager and beef fat. and of course, pinto beans. even though the can didn’t specify what type of chile, i went with anchos as they’re the base of your common chili powder. i rehydrated the anchos and then blended them with some tomatoes, vinegar, cumin and paprika. and instead of beef fat, i opted to use beef broth instead. while the beans cooked, the house smelled gorgeous and the broth tasted right. but it wasn’t until after a few hours when i ladled out a bowl that i realized that this bowl of beans far exceeded my expectations. i threw in some sour cream, warmed up a flour tortilla and had a most satisfying meal. and even though it’s been 15 years since i gave away those beans, i’ve often wondered if the new yorker who ended up with them enjoyed them. i hope that they did. ranch style beans ingredients: 16 oz. of dried pinto beans 6 ancho chiles, stems and seeds removed 6 cloves of garlic, minced 1 onion, diced 1 15 oz. can of tomatoes (or 2 medium-sized tomatoes, peeled) 1 teaspoon brown sugar 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon oregano 1 cup of water 6 cups of beef broth salt and black pepper to taste method: soak the beans covered in water—either overnight or the quick soak method in which you place the beans in a pot, cover with water, bring to a boil, cover and remove from heat and let sit for one hour. drain the soaked beans. in a cast-iron skillet heated up to medium high, cook the anchos on each side for a couple of minutes (or until they start to bubble and pop), turn off the heat and fill the skillet with warm water. let them sit until soft and rehydrated, which should happen after half an hour or so. in the pot you’ll be cooking your beans, heat up a teaspoon of canola oil and cook the onions for ten minutes on medium. add the garlic and cook for another minute. throw the cooked onions and garlic in a blender and add the tomatoes, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, paprika, cumin, oregano, water and hydrated ancho chiles. puree until smooth. add the pinto beans and beef broth to the pot and stir in the chile puree. on high, bring the pot to a boil and then cover; turn the heat down to low and simmer for two and a half hours, stirring occasionally. at this point, i check my beans for tenderness as depending on the freshness of the beans i find that the cooking time can be as short as two and a half hours and as long as four hours. when you're satisfied that the beans are done, salt and pepper to taste. feeds four to six. notes: if you can’t find dried ancho chiles, you can substitute either ancho chile powder or regular chili powder. i’d use 1/4 of a cup. these are not fiery beans, but if you want a bit more heat i'd throw in a bit of cayenne. and i always add a pinch of baking soda to my soaking beans to help with digestion issues. you may do the same. ----------------- are you on facebook? a reader recommended i set up a homesick texan fan page, so i did. please stop by and feel free to share links, upload photos or just say howdy! homesick texan fan page if you were in houston in the 1980’s, it was hard to escape the ubiquitous tacos al carbon. ninfa laurenzo—of the eponymous ninfa’s—made them her signature dish and as with her green sauce , many houston mexican restaurants soon added these tacos to their menus as well. tacos al carbon became a defining characteristic of houston tex-mex but what exactly are tacos al carbon? the term al carbon is the spanish phrase for cooking over coal, so you should expect grilled meats inside a tortilla. if you have tacos al carbon in mexico, you will indeed find a variety of meats wrapped in either corn or flour tortillas depending on where you are geographically. but in texas tacos al carbon came to mean one thing: cuts of grilled beef, nestled in a fluffy flour tortilla . but wait, isn’t that a fajita? now this is where it gets confusing. so what's the difference between fajitas and tacos al carbon? as i understand it, very little. fajitas, which translates to little belts, are traditionally made with the tough diaphragm cut of beef known as skirt steak, which is a long and narrow, much like a belt. the meat is often marinated and then grilled or griddled, and it’s served with a prescribed array of condiments such as guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and a stack of flour tortillas, all used to roll your own tacos. and yes, you can make fajitas, the dish, out of shrimp or chicken, but since the word itself refers to the cut of beef, technically it should be called something else. tacos al carbon, however, can be made with any type of meat, not just the traditional skirt steak. and unlike fajitas, the tacos are already made instead of being a do-it-yourself affair. i think this is the main difference, but even for me it’s a bit of a semantic stretch. small differences aside, i still prefer tacos al carbon to fajitas. sure, fajitas are a quite the spectacle, but sometimes you crave a more refined presentation. (or perhaps i prefer tacos al carbon because i burned myself on the sizzling fajita skillet one too many times!) but no matter how you serve it, it’s hard to resist a fresh flour tortilla wrapped around succulent beef so flavorful you can eat the two together unadorned. i live in a small apartment without any outdoor space so there’s no cooking over coal for me. but if i get my cast-iron skillet hot enough and then slide my steak under the broiler, i get a nice charred crust that’s almost as good as what i could get on a grill. so yes, technically these aren’t true tacos al carbon (they're more like tacos a la plancha, which means tacos of the griddle). but i don’t mind because after one bite i’m back in that little restaurant on navigation where the beef is juicy, the tortillas are soft and the green sauce is plentiful. tacos al carbon, small-apartment style ingredients: 2 pounds skirt steak juice of 4 limes (about 1/2 cup) 4 cloves of garlic 1/4 cup cilantro 1 jalapeno 1 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 teaspoon of canola oil or nonstick cooking spray four green onions (optional) method: to make the marinade, in a blender mix all the ingredients except for the skirt steak, canola oil and green onions. pour over skirt steak and let it marinate for 2 to 8 hours in the refrigerator. before cooking, rinse off the marinade and let the steak come to room temperature. heat on high for 10 minutes a large cast-iron skillet or grill pan (you may have to cut the steak in half to fit). also, turn on the broiler in your oven. when the skillet is hot (to test i throw in a drop of water and it should immediately evaporate), grease your pan with either the oil or nonstick cooking spray and add your steak. cook on one side for two minutes then turn and cook on the other side for two minutes. after it’s cooked on both sides, place the green onions in the skillet with the steak still in it and place the skillet under the broiler for two minutes. remove steak from pan and let it rest for 10 minutes. if onions aren’t charred enough, slide the skillet back under the broiler. after meat has rested, slice the meat against the grain and roll in fluffy, flour tortillas with green onions on the side. serves 4-6. notes: i don’t have a grill or outdoor space, so i don’t know as much as i’d like to about the subject, but to cook the steaks truly al carbon, i’ve been told five minutes per side should do the trick. --------- homesick texan has been nominated for best regional food blog in savuer’s first annual best food blog awards. i’m pleased as punch about this nod as it just confirms what we’ve all known for a long time: texas food is wonderful! please be sure and check out all the excellent blogs nominated--it's quite a round up! and if you’re so inclined i’d love your vote, which you can place right here . thank you! i’m roasting chiles and frying up bacon. what am i making, you might ask? what everybody wants to eat after being ill for a few days: chipotle macaroni and cheese. with bacon, of course. ok, so this might seem a bit heavy for a re-entry into the land of the normal eating, but let me tell you—i’m hungry! and while the best thing i can say about not feeling well is that your skinny jeans are suddenly a viable option in your wardrobe, in the end i’d rather be well than ill. though who wouldn’t? but let’s talk about chipotle macaroni and cheese, shall we? my family, much like yours i reckon, has always made homemade macaroni and cheese. sure, we’d have the box stuff on hand for after-school snacks or donations to the church food pantry, but in my house the real, homemade stuff was what was preferred. mom makes her macaroni and cheese in a variety of ways, but my favorite is a casserole of pasta suspended in a luscious sauce comprised of egg yolks, cheese and heavy cream. and just when you think it couldn’t be any more extravagant, she throws in diced, thick ham and tops it off with buttery breadcrumbs. yes, this is an excellent dish, but because of its richness i only advise serving it on special occasions. when it comes to a more everyday, simple macaroni and cheese, i turn to a method i learned in the new york times. this recipe requires little effort besides pouring cottage cheese blended with milk over dry pasta, tossing in some shredded cheese and baking it for an hour. no endless stirring a sauce or boiling a batch of pasta, which makes it a cinch to make. the times version kept it plain, but i’ve made it my own by adding chipotle and garlic. and i top it with bacon and cotija, which adds contrast to the oozing cheese and soft pasta. i realize that my macaroni and cheese may appear decadent as decadent as my monm's, but feel free to convince yourself that it’s a touch more healthy due to the cottage cheese and all. i do. but you know what? we’re nearing the end of a long, cold winter and sometimes you just need to pamper yourself. and for me, comfort comes clothed in chipotle chiles, cheese and bacon. chipotle macaroni and cheese with bacon (adapted from the ny times) ingredients: 2 cups of dry elbow pasta 2 cups of milk 1 cup of cottage cheese 1 chipotle chile in adobo 1 teaspoon mustard powder 1 clove of garlic, roughly chopped pinch of cumin salt and black pepper to taste 3 cups of shredded cheese, a mix of cheddar and monterey jack 1/4 cup of crumbled cotija cheese (optional, but delicious!) 4 pieces of cooked bacon, chopped 1 tablespoon of butter method: heat the oven to 375 degrees. grease a 9-inch cast-iron skillet or a 9-inch square or round baking pan with the butter. add the dry pasta. in a blender, mix together the milk, cottage cheese, chipotle chile, mustard powder, garlic, cumin, salt and black pepper until it’s smooth. pour mixture over dry pasta and stir until sauce is evenly distributed. stir in two cups of the shredded cheese, cover the pan with foil and bake for 30 minutes. after 30 minutes, remove the foil and stir the macaroni and cheese a couple of times. top with the remaining 1 cup of shredded cheese and chopped bacon and cook for another 25 minutes uncovered or until brown and bubbling. remove from oven, sprinkle with cotija and serve. note: if you’re not familiar with cotija cheese, it’s a mexican hard cheese that’s like a cross between feta and parmesan. it’s become increasingly more common, so you can find it at many regular grocery stores and hispanic markets. and if you live in new york city, i found at mexicana bakery in jackson heights at 86-06 roosevelt a wonderful cotija coated in dried chiles. also, chipotle bacon jam might go dandy with this as well! the day before ash wednesday? yep, i’m a pancake eater. i grew up in an episcopalian family and that’s how we rolled—in warm griddlecakes and cold glasses of milk. and even though most of my friends prepare for lent in a more colorful style, old traditions are hard to shake and i still enjoy a tall stack of pancakes on shrove tuesday. pancakes might not be shiny beads, feathered costumes, fevered dancing or boisterous singing, but they don’t have to be completely boring. i’ve been known to serve gingerbread pancakes , buttermilk pancakes, banana nut pancakes and chocolate chip pancakes. but to truly get in the frenzied spirit on the eve of lent, uncle austin’s coconut pancakes (more colorfully known as uncle austin's mexican pancakes) are a definite must. when i was young, austin would make these pancakes for us on special occasions. their main attraction was their size—he’d make one pancake the entire width of a 10-inch pan. and you didn’t even have to share this big baby—no way—this over-sized coconut pancake was all for you! but incredible heft aside, austin’s mexican pancakes were sweet with fresh coconut, and some family members allege that there was chocolate and nuts in them as well. i asked austin for his recipe, but he said that not only had he not made these in 30 years, but also that he never really had one. instead, he just took my grandpa’s basic pancake recipe and dolled it up a bit with the shredded coconut, chunks of brown sugar and extra pats of butter. curious why they were known as mexican pancakes, he admitted that there was nothing authentically mexican about them, but it was very, very important to be listening to tejano music, preferably loud, while making them. he stressed, however that the main excitement was in the flipping of the 10-inch pancake—the messier the better! if you’re celebrating pancake tuesday, why not try uncle austin’s mexican coconut pancakes—they’re far more adventurous than your usual buttermilk pancakes. and with the tejano thumping and the pancake batter flying, it may be the most thrilling pancake supper you’ve ever had! what's your favorite pancake recipe? coconut pancakes (uncle austin’s mexican pancakes) ingredients: 1 egg 1 1/2 cups of milk 2 cups of flour 1 tablespoon of whole-wheat flour 1 tablespoon of fresh baking powder 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup fresh shredded coconut juice from one lime (about 2 tablespoons) plus 1/2 teaspoon of lime zest 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon 4 tablespoons of melted butter method: beat together the egg and the milk. stir in the rest of the ingredients and mix until smooth. if too thick, add more milk for regular-sized pancakes, pour 1/4 cup of batter onto greased skillet heated at medium low. for austin-sized pancakes, pour about 1 1/2 cups to 2 cups of batter into pan. cook for a few minutes on one side, until edges are brown and bubbles form in batter. flip and cook on other side a couple more minutes. makes about 12 small pancakes or 3 extra-large pancakes. note: chopped pecans and chocolate chips are an excellent addition if you like. austin recommends serving them with pineapple and i agree. i also top my pancakes with yogurt, but honey or syrup would be dandy as well. and austin didn’t add limejuice or cinnamon in his original recipe—that was my doing. when i was invited to a party where southern pork dishes were being celebrated, the decision on what to bring was a no-brainer: mexican chocolate pralines. now before you call my contribution a little odd, let me explain myself. my first (and more obvious) choice was to make cookies with lard. i didn’t have any lard on hand, however, so i went to the union square farmers’ market to pick up a tub. but a snowstorm had threatened to blanket the city and my preferred lard vendor wasn’t there; clearly, i had to come up with another plan. i’ve been spending lots of time lately reading old cookbooks. i’m curious to see what our ancestors ate and to see when certain dishes may have come into the common culinary vernacular. when looking for inspiration, i recalled that i had recently come across an old mexican-candy recipe that called for piloncillo (or brown sugar) to be cooked with water and a strip of raw bacon. now, i know bacon in a dessert is a trendy thing these days, but i was intrigued to see it listed in a 100-year-old recipe. and while i didn’t have lard to make cookies, bacon was easily attainable. in another cookbook, i had seen a recipe for mexican-chocolate pralines. so for the pork-themed feast, i decided to combine the two thoughts and make mexican-chocolate pralines with bacon. making a first-time dish to share at a large gathering is always brave if not foolish. and while the flavor of these pralines was pleasing, the texture was too delicate. so instead of patties thick with pecans and bacon, i had broken chips and shards instead. my pralines looked sad. plus you couldn’t even really taste the bacon! but i was out of time and couldn’t show up empty handed so i threw the pieces into a tin and headed to the party. i suppose my offering these praline pieces was the equivalent of a student who shows a failed project to a teacher to prove that she has at least tried to complete the assignment. i gave myself about a c for effort. but then a strange thing happened. while at the party, i witnessed people eating the mexican-chocolate praline pieces. and they were smiling! with pleasure! so, with a little work i knew i could make the mexican chocolate pralines into something special. buoyed by my friends’ comments, the next day i attempted to make these pralines again. i threw out the bacon (even though it had been the primary impetus to make these in the first place), added more nuts, let the candy cook longer and threw in some orange zest for a hint of brightness. and after an hour of letting the pralines harden, i had a long sheet of parchment paper lined with a fine batch of mexican chocolate pralines. if you’re looking for valentine’s inspiration, these take little time and effort to make but are very impressive (even when they’re not entirely perfect). but you don’t need a special occasion to eat them, as they’re a simple pleasure that can be enjoyed at any time. mexican chocolate pralines (adapted from aprovecho ) ingredients: 1 disc of mexican hot chocolate, such as ibarra 2 oz. of unsweetened baking chocolate 2 cups of pecans, 1 cup chopped and 1 cup whole 1 1/2 cups of sugar 3/4 cup of brown sugar 1/2 cup of milk 6 tablespoons of butter 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 2 teaspoons fresh orange zest or 1 teaspoon dried orange zest 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract tools needed: candy thermometer parchment paper method: in an oven set at 350 degrees, roast the pecans for 10 minutes. in a large pot, melt together on medium heat the chocolates, sugars, pecans, milk, butter, cinnamon, orange zest, cayenne and sea salt, stirring occasionally. place a candy thermometer in the pot to monitor the heat. when it reaches 235 degrees, remove from fire and add the vanilla and stir the pot for two minutes. there should be a bit of shine to the candy but the candy will be a bit more thick. scoop pralines onto parchment paper. (if it’s too stiff, add warm water to mixture.) let cool for an hour and remove. they will still be a bit shiny but will lose that shine after a few hours. no matter, they're still delicious! depending on how large your scoops may be, this makes about 20 pralines. they will keep for five days. note: if you want to add bacon to these, i’d fry up four slices, crumble them and stir into praline when you add the vanilla. growing up in houston, i’m no stranger to chicken and sausage gumbo. the city’s close proximity to louisiana’s cajun country insured that i knew plenty of kids with family names such as boudreaux, guidry or hebert, whose parents often had a big pot of the chunky soup simmering on the stove. after an afternoon of riding bikes, you could walk into one of these kitchens, grab a bowl and ladle a portion thick with smoky, succulent meats over a pile of rice. gumbo is good and during the cold months it was almost as prevalent as chili in my part of town. with the new orleans saints going to the super bowl for the first time, the decision about what to make on the big day is simple. sure, quarterback drew brees may be a texan but my super bowl plan is to cook a big pot of chicken and sausage gumbo. and while i’ve long been a gumbo eater for some reason, however, i’ve never been much of a gumbo maker. so when i needed advice, i turned to ken wheaton. ken wheaton, who lives in brooklyn but hails from opelousas, louisiana, is famous in certain new york city circles for his gumbo. so much that when his editor caught wind of his prowess, he insisted that ken include his recipe in his excellent new novel, the first annual grand prairie rabbit festival . ken’s novel isn’t a food novel, per se. nope, it’s a story about a confused catholic priest struggling with his faith and vows. and while that may seem like a heavy topic, in ken’s hands it’s a humorous, heartfelt story that will make you laugh and might even make you cry. but it will also make you hungry for both cajun food and culture as ken deftly captures small-town louisiana life in all its church-going, zydeco-dancing and gumbo-making glory. and yes, please note that there’s also lots of swearing, drinking and rabbit-stew eating—it’s not a book for the easily offended. i won’t get into plot particulars, nor will i delve into any other english-major mumbo jumbo that i probably knew at one point but have long since forgotten. but do know this: ken is an expert storyteller who has an amazing gift of creating a sense of place. and if you’ve been aching to spend some time in cajun country with some colorful characters, his book will tide you over until you can enjoy the real thing. of course, you can also satisfy your hunger by making a batch of gumbo. because i like to tinker, i messed with ken’s method just a bit, but i followed his key rules to not add tomatoes, mushrooms or carrots. and while the word gumbo stems from the bantu term for okra, kingombo , i didn’t add that as well even though it’s quite common to include it for both flavor and its thickening power. if you’ve ever been intimidated by making gumbo, as i was, don’t be. the hardest part is making the roux (which i now do in the oven so it’s a snap) and waiting for the soup to be ready. and when you tuck into your bowl filled with a rich broth, smoky sausage and tender chicken, you’ll be happy that you made a batch. your friends and family will thank you, too. but enough about me, what are y'all making for the super bowl? chicken and sausage gumbo (adapted from ken wheaton) ingredients: 1 four-pound chicken, cut into parts 2 pounds of andouille sausage, sliced 2 onions, 1 diced and 1 cut into quarters 10 cloves of garlic, 5 minced and 5 whole 4 ribs of celery, 3 diced and 1 cut into quarters 2 bell peppers, diced 4 bay leaves 2 sprigs of fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dry 1 bunch of green onions, green part diced 1 cup of canola oil plus a tablespoon 1 cup of flour 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon of filé powder plus more for serving salt, cayenne and black pepper to taste method: to make your roux, in a large cast iron skillet, mix together the flour and the canola oil. place in an oven set at 350 degrees, walk away and let it cook for two hours. no hovering, no stirring, no nothing! after a couple of hours, take it out of the oven and it should be chocolate brown. now, you can also do it the standing over the stove method if you prefer, but i don’t. while the roux is cooking, make your chicken and broth. first, season your chicken parts generously with salt, black pepper and cayenne. place the chicken parts in a large pot with the quartered onions, whole garlic, quartered celery, 2 bay leaves and 8 quarts of water. bring to a boil and then simmer for an hour and a half, skimming any foam that rises to the surface. take the chicken out of the pot and when it’s cool, remove the fat and pick the meat off the bones and cut into pieces. (be sure and save the bones for another round of stock making.) when the broth is cool, strain and throw out the vegetables. remove the fat with a gravy separator or by the plastic bag method. to do the latter, you’ll pour the broth into a quart-sized plastic storage bag and once you see the fat rise to the top, snip off a bottom corner and drain it until you reach the fat layer. do this in batches. you should have about 8 quarts. clean your pot (or get another big one if you’re blessed with a large, well-stocked kitchen) and in the bottom of it heat up 1 tablespoon of canola oil. add the diced onions and let them cook for 10 minutes. add the chopped celery and bell pepper, cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally. throw in the minced garlic and cook for a minute. now stir in the roux and cook it with the vegetables for five minutes, stirring every so often. add the chicken meat and half of the sliced sausage and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. if things start to get sticky, pour in some water or wine. now, slowly whisk in your strained chicken broth to the roux, vegetable, meat mixture. throw in two more bay leaves, thyne and the worcestershire, bring to a boil and then simmer for an hour. at this time add the remaining sausage and cook for another hour. fifteen minutes before it’s done, add the minced green onions and filé powder and check to see if it needs salt, black and cayenne pepper. remove bay leaves and serve over cooked rice with file powder for people to add to their bowls. notes: this is a soupy gumbo. if you like it thicker, use less liquid and/or cook it for a lot longer than stated here. filé (pronounced fee-lay) powder is ground sassafras leaves and a dash of it will also help thicken it. if you’re feeling wild, replace the canola oil with bacon grease. ken also adds tasso (a cajun ham) to his chicken and sausage gumbo, but i couldn’t find that here in nyc. if you’re in that predicament, however, ken suggests ordering your sausage and tasso from his hometown butcher, kelly's country meat block & diner (toll free 1-866-948-meat). he says, "i usually order pure pork sausage, but lots of people are fans of the half&amp;half (beef and pork). the andouille is killer. the tasso is awesome. they also have rabbits, too!" or he likes to use bruce aidell’s andoille sausage, as he believes it has an authentic flavor. he also prefers cooking up only chicken thighs and skipping the whole broth-making step and just adds water to the pot as he lets his pot of gumbo simmer forever. do this if you prefer. full disclosure: ken’s my friend and i’ve been watching him write this novel for many years, so you can take what i say about it with a grain of salt. that said please know i would never recommend something unless i loved it and thought y’all might love it, too. a friend and i were comparing notes about our favorite childhood treats. as i was raving about my grandma’s chocolate pie , my friend said, “so how’s your grandma’s chocolate gravy?” huh? chocolate gravy—is that like mole, i asked. nope, it’s spooned on biscuits, she said. i had to admit that i’d never heard of chocolate gravy; clearly i’d been deprived. curious why i had been denied the joys of chocolate gravy all my life, i called my grandma and demanded an explanation. “why don’t you make chocolate gravy?” i asked. she replied, “because i don’t know what it is.” i see. apparently, my grandma was in the dark on this secret as well. my only consolation? at least i wasn’t alone. so what’s the provenance of chocolate gravy? because i know everything, i assumed that if i hadn’t heard of it, then it must not be texan. i was wrong. i poked around and not only had my friend—a long-standing texan—grown up eating it within slapping distance of dallas, but other texan friends had been eating it all their lives as well. i heard chocolate-gravy stories from friends as far west as midland and as far south as houston. though friends who had grown up in arkansas, tennessee and georgia had also indulged, so it’s not particular to just texas. but no matter, my family had been missing out on a very good thing. i needed to make up for lost time. a little research revealed that there hadn’t been much chocolate-gravy recipe evolution over the years. the biggest schism i found in the chocolate-gravy community was whether to use milk or water as your liquid. i was surprised that no one had thrown some chipotle or bacon into their gravy, but actually this pleased me as it proved that chocolate gravy was indeed a classic that didn’t need any tinkering. but enough about thinking, it was time to eat. i made my first batch and it was a deep, dark concoction—smooth, creamy and thick. i sliced a biscuit in half and plopped some chocolate gravy on each half. my first bite revealed this gravy’s pleasures. its pudding-like consistency is pure comfort on a cold, winter morning. and while biscuits are in no way virtuous, their texture and heft prevents the gravy from sliding into total decadence, which is important as this is a breakfast treat after all, not dessert. does chocolate gravy and biscuits replace my beloved chocolate pie? no, but i certainly wouldn’t pass up an opportunity to pass an occasional morning with it poured on top of a biscuit. and am i the only one who didn’t grow up eating this? no matter, i am very, very pleased to finally make its acquaintance. chocolate gravy ingredients: 3/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup of flour 1/4 cup of cocoa powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 2 cups of milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon of butter method: mix together in a pot the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, salt and cinnamon (can sift if it’s too lumpy). add the milk and while stirring cook on medium heat until it thickens. stir in the vanilla and butter and serve immediately with biscuits . notes: as you can see in the photos i topped mine with some chopped pecans. if you’re not a purist, i highly recommend this; hazelnuts would be delicious as well. and if you’re feeling extra spicy, go ahead and throw in a pinch of cayenne or chipotle powder! and this is how fellow-texan shaw
Female: 100%, Female, after a year and a half off from racing, it was time to think about doing another tri. but since i’m still dealing with some atrophy in my left leg, the idea of doing much running didn’t appeal – even though i’m a runner. i was just enjoying getting back into a more regular routine of training. i swear i missed my friends and the lifestyle more than the races – even though the races act as a big giant carrot to motivate me to train. in january, i had an epiphany on the way home from my master’s swim workout. ‘hey, if i can swim 3,000 yards now, maybe i can swim 2.4 miles by the summer.’ i kept that thought to myself for a couple of weeks. then i confessed my crazy thought-slash-pipe dream to sharkbait. and later that week, i asked my trail patrol partner, the governor, if he thought i could ride my bike 112 miles by the summer. (he knows i’m out of shape and i’ve never done a century in my life.) and since, i can be really insecure sometimes i got three more second opinions. i asked my swim coach, mary, 734’s dad, and my rehab therapist, quinn, if they thought i could go those distances. no one hesitated – except me. ‘should i do it? should i do it?’ after thinking about it another day, i finally hit the ‘submit’ button. game on. i’m doing the full vineman aquabike on july 31st. it’ll be just like doing an ironman without the 26-mile run-walk-‘til-i-drop. it will give me a chance to really work on my triathlon weaknesses. and it will give me time to gain back all that quad muscle strength before i do some serious running and racing again. i’m going long with the goal of getting strong. last year, i saw an older woman with a walker enter the rehab pool. she had a t-shirt with big letters bedazzled in silver dots that said, “fierce.” that pretty much described the weather out here in the past couple of weeks. the music in our pilates class was interrupted by a tornado warning issued by the national weather service. we were dumbfounded. that doesn’t happen in southern california. if anything, we get waterspouts offshore. we used levity to hide our concern and joked about taking shelter under the reformer. when i got out to my car, there were two messages from 734’s dad. and by the time i got home, the phone rang again and this time it was my dad in boston, sounding a tad agitated because he saw my neighborhood on the news. turns out the tornado touched down two miles from my place. i had no idea. i downplayed the whole thing and said the news trucks always hang out for the waves and the puddles in january. ha, i had no idea a truck and two boats had been flipped nearby. roofs had been torn off and windows broken. i live near the beach with an ocean view. watching the waves come in was like watching fireworks. i couldn’t stop gawking at them. and in the middle of the night, if the wind howled a little too much, i ran into the living room – away from the windows. we had tons of people who came by our pier to assess the damage to the beach and take pictures of the ocean. pictures that only told half the story. because the sound that they made, the smell, and the way they shook the shore and the pier was nothing short of fierce. after only a half dozen master’s swimming workouts, i’m starting to notice a few distinct changes. 1. i can swim a lot farther than i thought. last night my training log calculated 7.59 miles so far this year. (in a perfect world, it would’ve been 7.34, but coach mary pushed me to go longer.) 2. i’m learning how to do swim strokes that i’ve never really attempted before because no one ever made me or showed me how to do them. my backstroke isn’t pretty, but i haven’t caused any damage to my training partners yet. 3. i’m cramping so badly during workouts that my body feels possessed after 1,500-2,000 yards. i figure my toes and calves are going through an adaptation phase. or maybe it should be classified as hazing since this master’s group feels a bit like a sorority when we’re laughing about our workouts in the locker room. 4. my laundry hamper is piling up a lot faster with big towels. 5. i’m frequently reaching for those swimmer’s eardrops. 6. i’m positively giddy with endorphins after each workout. 7. my happiness quotient has gone way up. sharkbait noticed a difference too. near the end of wednesday’s workout, she called out to me from a couple of lanes away with a smile and a nod of approval, “you’re gliding!” “what?” i replied. “you’re gliding!!” “oh,” i answered. a compliment on my swimming definitely takes a little while to register. i wondered, ‘have i ever glided before? and if so, when?’ there i go overanalyzing things again. who cares? for one length of the pool, it happened. i had a witness. i’m ending this post with a shout out to some of my favorite bloggers. this week’s six’s picks include the new mr . and mrs. james walsh , running is funny , tritawn , steve in a speedo?! gross! (and his lovely wife pharmie ). last year, i reluctantly kept track of my workout log. i found myself filling in some of the blanks at the end of ’09 like it was the week before taxes. i pieced things together by asking for copies of my workout log at the gym and scanning my garmin data. sadly, most of my swim workouts never got recorded. i know i did a bunch of them with a pull buoy at the local school’s pool. enter the new year’s resolution: be more consistent. that applies to everything from filling out my log on fitness journal.com to cleaning out the fridge. and with this resolution comes another (which i’ve been working on for a few months), don’t fret, worry or feel guilty about all the stuff that didn’t get done. i’m trying to focus more on the doing and less on the angst of what i’m not getting done. i know i may slip from time to time on this one, but i’ll keep plugging away at it. i’m happy to report that 2010 is off to a great start. in the first 10 days of the year, i’ve worked out on 7 days doing 7 different activities. and this afternoon, i think i rinsed out 7 old condiment jars and put them in the recycling bin. seven (aka 734, the cat) will be so proud. actually, he won’t care as long as i hide 7 treats around the house to keep him occupied. i’m savoring the holidays as much as possible. i know, i know, time to move on to the resolutions. i’m stalling big time. i don’t even want to take my tree down, but i will this afternoon. suffice it to say, the holidays were just what i needed this year. perhaps they should add another christmas in july just to stimulate the economy and raise morale. i don’t think it’s just me. everyone seems to be in a better mood. i had a great time kicking back with my loved ones, finding gifts, wrapping them and all of that good stuff. and while i had to use more restraint than i would have liked this year, it was the thought that counted – both on the giving and receiving end. one of my favorite gifts came with this custom tag created by 734’s dad’s brother ken . how cool. it was attached to some tempo music, the gorillaz demon days cd. my family, 734’s dad , and my training partners came through with some awesome gifts to get me in the mood to train. more importantly, they made me feel like an athlete again. sharkbait gave me some cycling socks with autumn leaves to remind me of home and an assortment of gels and electrolyte drink mixes. tridiver gave me some pearl izumi running gloves and a triathlete license plate holder. my marathoner sister, jane, gave me a nice running jacket. ryan surprised me with a text, “hey, don’t do anything stupid like renewing your subscription to triathlete magazine. merry christmas!” and 734’s dad gave me everything on my wish list. wow, how did he ever know? (that’s right, i hinted big time.) when i opened the finis hydro hip training tool, he said, “hey, i thought only maxi pads had wings!” i know he secretly gets a kick out of seeing all the idiosyncrasies that go along triathlon training. 734’s dad’s parents gave me a very generous check to pass onto the challenged athletes foundation . they knew i would have liked to do operation rebound again last year at oceanside. i was quite touched by that gesture. and one of my all-time favorite gifts came from nikki, sharkbait’s daughter. since the kid recently went through quite a growth spurt, i received her old tyr split fins. i heard good things about these fins. i’m hoping they really improve my swim. i’m also hoping that osmosis takes affect because this girl can swim 100 yards in 1:15. yeah, i wanna swim like her! hmm, okay i just don’t want to be lapped by her. ‘cause that wouldn’t be very nice to do to “mealie minnow” would it? uh-oh, i think i just signed up for my first swim race. rumor has it, the kid reads my blog. when i arrived at the pool last night, it was about 45 degrees. if this steam and fog came off a big black caldron, you’d swear it was some sort of witch’s brew. a cold and holiday festivities kept me out of the pool for a couple of weeks. i was excited to get back in there. coach mary gave me some instructions for a set, “okay, i want you to leave on the :40.” i suspect i wasn’t quite that punctual, but i really have no idea. i was having a lucy/miss magoo moment out there. i couldn’t see the clock through the fog at the other end of the pool. i couldn’t see how much time elapsed on my lap counter. and i was fumbling with my polar to get it to stopwatch mode because i couldn’t see the numbers on that either. rather than draw attention to my inability to see, i just swam as fast as i could and tried not to dawdle too much in between. i swam until i had goose bumps on my goose bumps and my left calf and right toes cramped. mary still made me do a cool down with a pull buoy. i knew she was right, but it sure didn’t feel like i needed a cool down with the onset of hypothermia. i managed to go 2,050 yards. after a nice hot shower, sharkbait invited me over to her house for some ham-and-split pea soup. is there anything better on a cold night? it reminded me of snow days in massachusetts, when school was cancelled and i could sled for hours in the backyard. when i arrived at her house, sharkbait lamented, “i couldn’t see anything in that fog! i couldn’t make out the clock or see the numbers on my watch.” i felt so relieved that it wasn't just me. now, if barracuda could just come out with foggy night-vision goggles next. aside from all the fun holiday celebrations, my absolute favorite thing this past week was getting back to the dirt. some women like perfume. i like the smell of dirt. the sting of the crisp, cool air. and the sound of the reeds rustling in the wind. i got it all when i went for a trail run on the afternoon before christmas eve. it turned out to be 4.33 miles and it felt just right. i had to walk it in a couple of the steep spots, but overall i was able to run. and i’m very happy to report that it didn’t feel like i needed to borrow a lung. i was truly surprised that it felt that good. i did not expect that yet. so the day after christmas, i did it all over again. both days, i went out in my new xterra xr 1.0 shoes . they felt super-comfortable out there. no complaints whatsoever. on sunday, i had my monthly trail patrol for the california state parks. my third time back. keith, the governor, lead the way. i started out great and made it up a mile climb without too much trouble, although i’m sure i was quite slow. when we hit “no dogs” i couldn’t make it up the second hill, and i didn’t clip out fast enough. i didn’t want to land on my knee and instead i kind of hyper-extended my left leg and fell backwards. next thing i knew i was on the ground on my back with my santa cruz blur stuck between my legs at an awkward angle. a little embarrassing trying to extricate myself and get back up, except no one witnessed it. ha! keith and dan were already waiting at the top. falling is just part of mountain biking. but i could feel the disparity in my quad muscle strength as i attempted the climb. it’s a little bit of a bummer, but i know it will get better. it messed with my head for the rest of the ride though. we went on a new singletrack trail that was built with keith’s help while i was away – ticketron. normally, it would’ve been no problem. okay, maybe i would have popped off the bike in a couple of places. instead, i walked a lot of it with my bike. the steep climb out of deer canyon usually called for some hike-a-biking, but i was doin’ way more hikin’ than bikin’. when we arrived at the first stretch of single track on fenceline, it was no problem, but the second stretch, i had to clip out so quickly and so often that i gave up and walked the rest of the way. my knee ached a little – enough to give up on the idea of doing a brick workout with a little run afterwards. i got through it. i went to places i haven’t been to in a long time on my mountain bike. and i had a lot of fun hanging out with the guys. dan thought for sure that he would slow us down. nope, it was me. when we stopped for some nutrition, i mentioned that i really liked the hammer gel apple cinnamon flavor. i said, “wow, this tastes just like apple pie.” dan replied right back, “oh, i’d need ice cream with that…” which pretty much gives you the flavor of the conversation that went back and forth between three immature trail patrol volunteers. when we arrived back in the parking lot, we had a visit from 734’s dad who rode across a couple of mountain ranges to meet up with us and say “hi!” what a guy! next week, i get to do it all over again. hmmm, maybe i’ll take a different route. would you believe slow ‘n easy? yup, that’s a trail. a winding mile-and-a-quarter fire road. i wasn’t really sure what i’d write about here after my knee surgery last winter. i knew i wouldn’t have a triathlon season. i wanted to talk to others who came back strong after being sidelined. it was an idea that was kickin’ around in my head for a few weeks when the unthinkable happened. a dear friend of mine was in a serious ski accident and suffered a spinal cord injury, and a few days later a stroke. i felt helpless to do anything for him as he lay in the hospital. i decided to start a new series: comeback kids. i’d do a new story every friday for him, his family, and his closest buddies – for as long as he was in the hospital. that was the plan. i had no idea how i’d pull it off. i put it out there and hoped for the best. and i truly met the best in the process. friends, friends of friends, acquaintances, and complete strangers who were more than willing to do the phone interviews, email me pictures, and review their story drafts prior to posting on the big friday deadline. they divulged some pretty personal stuff, some pearls of wisdom, and always some kind words for my buddy. i’d like to thank each every one of them once again. hall of fame triathlete karen smyers who called me from a yellow cab in new york city on a business trip. pro triathlete joanna zeiger who said, “don’t quit with your rehab until you are satisfied with the results.” yes, she spent five hours a day doing rehab for her back injury. (she inspires me to keep doing two or three-hour workouts at my rehab gym.) my physical therapy aide and former nfl player, erroll tucker , who still encourages me during every weight workout. i’d venture to say that every single one of these comeback kids has a lot of heart, but dwight kroening completed ironman canada after receiving a heart transplant and wayne “the dead guy” wright completed 50 marathons in 50 u.s. states this october after undergoing a quadruple bypass. dennis tapp found a way to ride his bike across the country with the partial paralysis caused by five gunshots. sterling kwong completed ironman arizona after battling testicular cancer. casey kammel completed ironman coeur d'alene in unique style after being told he’d never walk again. andy bailey came back from a life-threatening mrsa infection and amputation to compete in triathlons again (at the age of 70). pitcher kara nilan returned to collegiate play after suffering a traumatic brain injury on the mound. my fellow rehab patient, lydia , continues to bravely fight cancer on top of the severe back pain from her paragliding accident. and my dear coach, beth hibbard , became a pro triathlete after breaking her neck. tawnee prazak and kevin quadrozzi , i have little doubt that you’ll both make it to kona some day. my fellow trail patrol mountain biker, jane , continues to inspire me as i hit the trails with a little trepidation these days. my friend laurie shattered some bones in her foot doing an irish jig, and completed an ultra-marathon less than a year later. ken stephenson helped me start this series off with a bang and his brother brad helped me keep the streak alive. (yes, there will be something nice for you under the tree, i mean in the fridge, this christmas!) some thought their stories and their injuries weren’t that special. from where i sit, they were all special. every day someone finds this blog because they searched google for words like “plica syndrome,” “broken collarbone,” or “tibial plateau fracture.” i’ve received thank-you notes from readers – from colorado to france to south africa – who have said they were inspired by your stories. you helped me immensely. you helped my friend and his loved ones. you helped keep this magical thing going for 18 weeks until my buddy was discharged from the hospital. last week, he started walking again with assistance. i look forward to the day when i can write his comeback kid story. until then, i plan to write a few more of these stories in the year ahead. and i thank you for making all of these stories possible. happy holidays! 
Female: 95%, Female, i've been thinking lately about what it is that draws a woman to a man and vice-versa? and is there really such a thing as love at first sight??i know for myself, there are certain things that immediately draw me in, and i'm talking pure aesthetics....a great smile (nice teeth), engaging eyes, good skin, nice hands....to name a few. but love?? what is it beyond that immediate attraction that makes someone take a second and a third and a fourth look?people often say that they know within the first 5 minutes whether someone they've met has boyfriend/girlfriend "potential" or not. i think what is more often the case is that you know instantly if someone doesn't have a chance, but not necessarily if they do. personality is such a huge x-factor and it is truly such a variable that i think it's almost impossible to completely rule someone out without having a conversation. and what is an appealing character trait in one person doesn't necessarily carry the same appeal on another. weird how that is....but when people overlook the fact that someone is rude, thoughtless, selfish, unkind, or disrespectful just to be with the bombshell or the handsome hunk, we know how long those relationships last - not very!there are certain deal breakers however. instant no-can-dos. shorter than me? nope. unintelligent? i'll pass. smoke cigarettes? hell to the no! now while i don't think i've ever experienced love at first sight, i think i've had lust, lol, but i would never rule out the fact that i
Female: 100%, Female, i don't remember the last time i had visited a grave on the mt. of olives. yes, i'd been to ibrahim's home, but he lives in the neighborhood of the living.&nbsp; i guess i don't know that many holy people.&nbsp; the mt. of olives is the world's oldest and holiest jewish cemetery dating from biblical times.&nbsp; many holy rabbis over the centuries have been buried there.&nbsp; even madonna visited one of the kabbalah rabbis, when she was here with the kabbalah center.&nbsp; this past friday, however, was the anniversary of my friend's son's death&nbsp;5 years ago.&nbsp; he had a rare genetic thing, which left him, since birth, severely handicapped.&nbsp; he never walked or spoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;when he died at the age of 14,&nbsp;he was buried in the mt. of olives in a special plot for holy children - those who never spoke bad about anyone.&nbsp; it is a special merit to be buried there because space is limited and is usually reserved for renowned rabbis these days.&nbsp; legend has it that when the resurrection happens, people buried there will be resurrected first. it was tough on my friend to visit his grave.&nbsp; she lost a son.&nbsp; it is always tough for the living.&nbsp; she knows he is fine, not trapped in a very handicapped body.&nbsp; when she dreams about him, he even&nbsp;speaks to her - something he never did when he was alive.&nbsp; i looked around at the gravestones.&nbsp; some were so tiny - the babies must have been a few days, weeks or months when they died.&nbsp; someone pointed out that right behind my friend's son's grave were the graves of the two holzberg children - the children of the chassidic couple that was killed&nbsp;during the mumbai massacre a couple of years ago by islamic&nbsp;extremists.&nbsp; they had died of illness&nbsp;before the tragedy with their parents&nbsp;occurred.&nbsp; now they have no parents visiting their graves - only a 4 year old brother and grandparents.&nbsp; after we read the psalms and the quorum of 10 men left, the mother and a few of her friends stayed on to sit and keep this young soul of her son some company.&nbsp; we listened to the mother grieve for her son, for her loneliness and some shared what they felt too. grieving for a loved one &nbsp;i felt serene and there was an atmosphere of contentment sitting around the little souls. tiny grave &nbsp;there were red poppies&nbsp;growing wild by unmarked graves.&nbsp; i looked at the holzberg graves and told my friend&nbsp;that her son and this&nbsp;boy were now friends and learning chassidut together.&nbsp;&nbsp; cellphones are expensive, but so necessary.&nbsp; i wonder how we managed years ago when we had to depend on pay phones to tell someone we'll be late, or make impulsive, last minute&nbsp;arrangements with friends and relatives.&nbsp; how inconvenient it all was, trying to find that quarter or whatever the cost was then.&nbsp; but my cellphone bill has been expensive of late and so i called up the competitor of my current cell provider.&nbsp; there are three major cellphone companies in israel, cellcom, pelephone and orange.&nbsp; i got a much better offer from the competitor, after complaining about my current cellphone provider&nbsp;so after a week or so, i got on the phone with my current provider and told them about the offer. can they match it?&nbsp; closely.&nbsp; they connected me with a special department called customer retention or something like that.&nbsp; i would get a new phone at 50% of the cost.&nbsp; i complained that their competitor offered me a free one.&nbsp; ok - then they'll give me a free one too.&nbsp; wow.&nbsp; it sounded so easy! i went to their service store and waited nearly an hour to be seated with one of their reps.&nbsp; they wrote my number down on a piece of paper. i was number 218.&nbsp; number 211 flashed on the screen but there was no customer.&nbsp; they probably got impatient and left.&nbsp; i could have been crafty and written the number 211 on the other side of the paper to be promptly seated - but i'm too american.&nbsp; or canadian.&nbsp; i'll wait my turn, the way civilized people are apt to do.&nbsp; i finally got my turn.&nbsp; the sales rep gets my phone number and asks me questions. "how much did they offer you?" i asked - "isn't it on the computer?" "yes, but you're a special case from the retention department.&nbsp; what exactly did they promise you?"&nbsp; i told him. "yes, you're right" he says - obviously regaining his eyesight, as what they promised was probably on the computer screen all along.&nbsp; i couldn't figure out why they were playing this game. about 5 minutes into this, a woman comes over to me&nbsp;with a typed up survey in her hand - asking me how the service is and how is the sales rep i'm talking to? "isn't it odd that you're asking me how is he when i'm&nbsp;right in front of him?| "give me a 10" said the sales rep to me. "ok, i'll give you a 10, but if i find that you're saying 'ok' to whatever was agreed on the phone and i get a totally different, more expensive,&nbsp;bill, i'm coming back to rate you a 1." "don't worry.&nbsp; the new rate will show up on your bill." the new rate didn't show up on what i signed, and after i questioned him, he said it was standard.&nbsp; i'll get the new rate on my next bill because i was a "special" case. "so in case you're lying to me, how long am i contracted to you? "18 months" fine.&nbsp;that's better than the&nbsp;more common&nbsp;3 year contract. &nbsp;if they're a bunch of liars, i'll use my phone minimally and pay the minimum charge and after 18 months switch to another provider.&nbsp; for years, ever since we made aliyah, i was considered by my kids to be so uncool.&nbsp; after all, i&nbsp;am an immigrant, speak hebrew with an embarrassing accent, plus my grammar is often wrong.&nbsp; i&nbsp;like western music, arabs, arabic music, health food,&nbsp;go to a trippy synagogue in jerusalem, invite non-jews for shabbat dinner, eat in different restaurants all the time,&nbsp;see foreign films and often&nbsp;go alone.&nbsp; my oldest&nbsp;daughter even bought me a birthday gift&nbsp;-&nbsp;a 10-movie package - at&nbsp;&nbsp;jerusalem's landmark&nbsp; smadar theater.&nbsp; i love the smadar.&nbsp; they didn't destroy the ottomon-era terracotta stone floors and opened up a restaurant attached to the theater.&nbsp; unlike the cinemateque, you can bring in your beer and cappucino or hot cider - even wine - into the theater.&nbsp; there are others like me who sit alone in the theater.&nbsp; lately, i saw the movies push and a serious man there.&nbsp; next week i'm seeing a korean film with a friend (!).&nbsp; but now, all of a sudden, i'm cool.&nbsp; my complainer daughter hardly complains anymore.&nbsp; she hugs and kisses me daily.&nbsp; the reason?&nbsp; she has a new boyfriend.&nbsp; this guy comes from a moroccan family but, and here's a big but, he enjoys ashkenazi (european/western) culture more than his own. he doesn't listen to middle eastern music and is astounded that my daughter acts more "moroccan" than he.&nbsp; it's something he has to get used to, he says.&nbsp; his brother is actually a famous israeli singer, who still churns out israeli hits.&nbsp; this new boyfriend loves the beatles, doors, stones and fats domino.&nbsp; my daughter doesn't know the songs to any of these.&nbsp; but now she's coming to me to learn this new western culture her boyfriend is into.&nbsp; she's now proud of her once-uncool mother.&nbsp; i know i'm going to have to bring that photo of ronnie wood of the rolling stones and me together at an art gallery out of&nbsp; basement storage to impress him. "you're gonna love my mother" she coos to her boyfriend. "you might even want to marry her", she jokes, perhaps knowing a little of my cougar fantasies. "see?&nbsp; this is how it starts.&nbsp; first you eat like that, and then you start inviting arabs into the house." griped my son-in-law, as i gave my daughter, his wife, some healing foods for her ulcerative colitis.&nbsp; brown rice with broccoli and carrots, drizzled with flax seed oil.&nbsp; i was amused by his theory, wondering if it were indeed true. he shook his head.&nbsp; he truly believes that granola eating hippies, like his mother-in-law, weren't always loving and tolerant&nbsp;human beings, but turned that way when they eschewed mostly junk food for a healthier lifestyle.&nbsp; his wife was eating crap, like diet soda and fast food nearly every day, and the result is ulcerative colitis, which i'm trying to help her heal through food.&nbsp; and if that will&nbsp;heal&nbsp;her body as well as her soul&nbsp;, then why not?&nbsp; because she'll turn into me?&nbsp; is that what he's afraid of?&nbsp; i laughed at the prospect of her turning into a peace-nik and inviting all the arabs who live in jabel mukaber into their tiny west jerusalem home, and him, another middle-east archie bunker, tearing his hair out. my son's school has been calling me all month trying to get me to come to another one of their "emergency" meetings about my son who shows up in school, but hardly in class. "there are&nbsp;teachers who don't even know who he is!" exclaimed his&nbsp;principal. i tell the principal's secretary that i can't make it on the sunday she wants me to come because my boss has a slew of meetings that day, and i have to prepare her on that day. "isn't your son important to you?&nbsp; don't you even care?&nbsp; is your job so much more &nbsp;important than your own son?&nbsp; we made this meeting with a lot of people involved and that's when they could come!!"&nbsp; the principal's secretary is actually screaming at me.&nbsp; i look at the phone.&nbsp; i'm totally pissed.&nbsp; she continues, "they want to throw him out of school.&nbsp; don't you think that's important?" i glare into the phone.&nbsp; unfortunately, she can't see me gritting my teeth. "you never asked me when "i" can make it.&nbsp; keeping my job is showing my kids how responsible i am.&nbsp; if i don't have my job, then we'll be living in the streets.&nbsp;i'm not ready to sacrifice my job for a meeting in school.&nbsp; sorry." i think she was shocked by my response.&nbsp; there was silence on the other end of the line. i&nbsp;continued.&nbsp; "if you want to throw him out of school, it will just have to wait another week." i shouted back at the secretary.&nbsp; i made the appointment for the week after, when my boss will be out of town. that afternoon i went into the local mall where one of the shops was selling pillows.&nbsp; my kids were all sleeping on pillows that had seen better days.&nbsp;&nbsp;but that day, i was only buying for&nbsp;one of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;i ask her to show me a selection for my 20 year old daughter.&nbsp; the shopkeeper shows me a latex pillow that is the most expensive one in the store. "it's quite a lot of money." i complained to her.&nbsp; "i'd like to buy her a mid-range one.&nbsp; not the cheapest and not the most expensive." she looked at me funny. "but it's your daughter!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; isn't she worth the best?" i looked at the shopkeeper funny. "absolutely not." and then i walked out of the store, seeing the shopkeeper's mouth still open.... here in the holy land, we are basking in the sun.&nbsp; i usually don't like to make you people living with cold weather jealous, but today i'll make an exception. we ate at bariba overlooking the yarkon river and reading plant mullet fish over risotto in saffron sauce the best mushroom gnocchi i've ever tasted covered with parmesean foam (!) all sorts of people passed by that dog wants ice cream some people went boating some kids went swimming the farmers market was in full swing one of hubby's favorite stores on dizengoff street with the latest fashion in undies (if you can call them that) road signs wishing travellers a shabbat shalom i prepared so well, i thought, for the upcoming ticket sales in israel for the elton john concert in june.&nbsp; i read the reports&nbsp; of groups trying to get him to boycott israel.&nbsp; yawn.&nbsp; this is getting boring already.&nbsp; they do this to every celebrity who books concerts here.&nbsp; most ignore the boycott pleas and threats.&nbsp; i hope elton has the balls to pay no heed to these party poopers.&nbsp; cancelling a concert will not make things better for palestinians in this country.&nbsp; it'll just piss me off and probably a few other peacemakers too.&nbsp; but getting back to the tickets...advance ticket sales were available to bank discount members beginning from 7:00 pm last night.&nbsp; i'm a member (or rather my husband is) - even though that bank pisses me off - except when they give their members perks such as this.&nbsp; &nbsp;i called up the bank last week to make sure that&nbsp;my credit&nbsp;card was open and ok to accept purchases.&nbsp; after all, it has been over a year since i used it.&nbsp; the bank clerk told me that there is no problem with the card.&nbsp; yesterday i called another bank clerk to get more credit in case i want to buy more than 4 tickets.&nbsp; he said everything is fine.&nbsp; wonderful.&nbsp; i'm ready. i did some errands then came back to the office at 6:45 pm and got the website ready on my computer.&nbsp; of course by the time 7:00 pm rolled around, it took me 20 minutes to get onto the site.&nbsp; i finally got in.&nbsp;&nbsp;yay!&nbsp; i filled out all the information they needed, picked out some fabulous seats in the front row on the side of the stage - very close to the stage, in fact - &nbsp;and then took my credit card out.&nbsp; i plugged in the numbers, my id number, etc. and then i saw the expiry date.&nbsp; i look at the card - remember, i had been planning this for a week already - and the expiry date says 09/09.&nbsp; shit!&nbsp; i tried putting in a random expiry date, but the computer is smart.&nbsp; it doesn't take my card.&nbsp; i use the other visa i have, but the computer insists i use the bank discount credit card.&nbsp; i leave the webpage open, just in case i never get in again because of all the people trying to buy tickets at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i have to think fast.&nbsp; i call up the credit card company.&nbsp; i'm frantic.&nbsp; i'm wondering if there are more frantic people calling them about elton john. "look, i'm trying to buy elton john tickets, and my visa date expired.&nbsp; can you give me a new updated date?&nbsp; please?" it&nbsp;seems hopeful at first while the clerk puts me on hold probably to speak to his manager.&nbsp; he comes back on. "sorry. you have to speak to your bank about this.&nbsp; we don't give new expiry dates." "but my bank doesn't open until 8:30 in the morning" i wailed. "can't you give me a temporary one?" "no.&nbsp; i'm so sorry."&nbsp; he really sounded sympathetic.&nbsp; but there was no point in arguing with him.&nbsp; i had to think quickly while the ticket sales website was still on the payment page.&nbsp; ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;i remembered that a good&nbsp;friend of mine has a discount visa.&nbsp; we tried doing this together, but she had a difficult time with the hebrew instructions.&nbsp; i guided her through but the transaction failed.&nbsp; she doesn't have enough credit on her card. never give up.&nbsp; my complainer daughter has to do something good for her mother, doesn't she, instead of chronically complaining all the time.&nbsp; i call her several times.&nbsp; she doesn't answer her phone.&nbsp; it's 8:00 pm, and no tickets.&nbsp; i go out for dinner with friends.&nbsp; my daughter calls and apologizes (!). she was working and couldn't answer her phone, but if i'm in town, we can go home together. yes, and i could take your visa, i thought.&nbsp; she didn't complain when i asked her for it.&nbsp; not a flinch.&nbsp; when i arrived home after midnight i went into my son's room where the computer is.&nbsp; i let him rant and rave about me making noise.&nbsp; i tried to bribe him with concert tickets but he's not interested.&nbsp; i finally get into the site.&nbsp; most of the great seats are gone - except for the very expensive lawn seats.&nbsp; i get a gate close to the stage, but 23 rows up.&nbsp; not bad.&nbsp; not as great as i could have gotten had i had an updated credit card, but they were good nevertheless. so elton, hang on....it'll be a rocky road with every asshole trying to get you to cancel the concert.&nbsp; don't listen to anyone.&nbsp; just do what you have to do so we can all have a great time together.... be careful who you start conversations with standing at bus stops.&nbsp; it's not like people are dangerous here.&nbsp; they aren't.&nbsp; and it's easy to jump into a&nbsp;stranger's conversation.&nbsp; the stranger who is talking usually looks around and talks to whoever is standing around.&nbsp; some are receptive and sometimes one can engage in fun conversation about all sorts of things while waiting for the bus. so yesterday i jumped into a bus stop conversation about people.&nbsp; persian people and then russian people. "not all of them are bad" said a woman to a man. "you always get one bad apple in the tree" the man answered. i interjected in hebrew, "well, what do you think about canadians?" bad move on my part.&nbsp; the man continued his tirade all throughout the 40 minute bus ride with me about his canadian neighbor whose dog barked outside every&nbsp;day at 4:00 am.&nbsp; "i told her i was going to kill the dog."&nbsp; he leered at me.&nbsp; he clearly isn't too fond of canadians.&nbsp; then he went on about putting talcum powder on the floor and i couldn't understand half of what he was saying.&nbsp; i really just wanted to relax on the bus ride home and not talk to anyone.&nbsp; i got home and tried to make dinner.&nbsp; the two men in the family began bickering. "who ate my cookies?" demanded hubby.&nbsp; someone at work made chocolate chip cookies for me&nbsp;for my birthday&nbsp; i brought them home and told hubby that they were for him for his birthday this week.&nbsp; he was so happy.&nbsp; before the cookies were eaten, that is.&nbsp; my son admitted to the crime.&nbsp; "there were only 10 left!" "10!!!&nbsp; you ate all 10???? you pig!!!" and a war of the words started, with name calling back and forth, which ended up with my son throwing hubby's files out of our son's room, where they are kept, and then hubby taking the computer monitor out of our son's room and putting it into our locked storage room. and then i thought it is much easier dealing with strangers on the bus, who can talk the ass out of a turkey, than this. it was bad enough when the water stopped running right before the sabbath.&nbsp; i was about to put on the slow cooker a dish called hamin, which takes overnight to cook, and consists of everything basically - meat, chicken, beans, potatoes, stuffing, barley, and seasoned either sweet or salty or middle eastern.&nbsp; the water shut off just as i was about to wash a bunch of scallions.&nbsp; i was horrified.&nbsp; i ended up washing the scallions in a pot full of water that had cooked the artichokes.&nbsp; i felt good.&nbsp; i was recycling.&nbsp; the neighbors kept on going onto the roof to see if they could fix the water thing (whatever it's called),&nbsp;while the rain was pouring down at the same time.&nbsp; for a few minutes they were successful and then --- no water from the taps.&nbsp; again.&nbsp; we thought of a weekend with toilets full of shit and family members in sore need of a shower. "i have my period!!" shouted one of my daughters during the meal. "what's a period?" asked my bright 18 year old son.&nbsp; he had no idea what that word meant in english. "you tell him" i ordered my son-in-law. but before our meal, while this water shortage thing was going on, i had smelled smoke coming from the air vents.&nbsp; i panicked because hubby was over at my married daughter's house in jerusalem and called the fire department.&nbsp; two men came into the house, looking like professional ...ghostbusters or whatever.&nbsp; oxygen tanks on their backs, contraptions which measure or find the source of the smoke.&nbsp; the odor was quite strong.&nbsp; they were with me in the apartment for a good 20 minutes.&nbsp; then i lift up one of my pots that was on the stove and see a little rattan coaster sticking to the bottom of the pot.&nbsp; it was burnt to a crisp.&nbsp; i found the culprit and i felt so stupid.&nbsp; the firemen looked at me and smiled.&nbsp; they must go through this often, i thought&nbsp;(perhaps others would be as mindless as myself). meanwhile, hubby returned as the men were leaving.&nbsp; he didn't care if the house was burning - he was just thrilled to be able to eat&nbsp;on paper plates, as his dishwashing duties was temporarily suspended. 
Female: 100%, Male, i missed you. did you miss me? first things first: i'm not dead. although i have to admit i get a sick little thrill when i imagine the idea of my being referred to as such. clearly there is something wrong with me; i generally rely on the "comments" section to begin to figure out what that something is. i would love to tell you that i was on some ashram for a year and a half, fixing my life and learning the true meaning of christmas, etc., but i wasn't. i did get my j.d., finally. two law firms, a lot of snooze-bars, tardiness, absenteeism, subpar legal work and a generous severance package later, here i am--gainfully employed again. for now. tomorrow, in fact, is the day that we're all expecting to get laid off on account of the financial crisis. of course it will only be about 10% of the firm's associates, but i can't imagine i won't be among them. how do i know? lawyers at firms are notorious for their reticence about criticizing an attorney's work product. they're generally not a confrontational lot. but i've gotten several talkings-to in my very brief tenure here: "we're troubled by this." "is everything ok?" "you really need to pay more attention to detail." "please review, on a non-billable basis, what i ultimately sent to the client and compare it to the draft you sent me." these are all bona fide clues. but what really does it that the secretaries on my floor can't even look me in the eye. they are the ones with the worst poker faces (get it, ha ha). they see me showing up at 10am most mornings and leaving at 1:30 with my laptop bag, feigning some sort of work-related hurry. the ones with a maternal instinct probably worry a little bit; the other ones probably think i am a little such-and-such. of course, i am a little such-and-such is the thing, but i still resent their knowing it. on the bright side, i've got some dollars in the bank. but i really can think of only one thing to do with those dollars, and i can assure you it's not to set up responsible payment plans with my increasingly vocal roster of creditors. i will talk more about money in the next one i post, which will be sometime before 2011, i promise. a year after i started this very self-aware project, and what do you suppose has changed? i don't gamble or want to gamble nearly as much as i used to. big deal. if you ever thought this blog was about gambling, you sort of missed the point, i think. although i'm grateful to all the poker players and what have you who found me in the past year. but it's not about those things. even if i thought that it was about them when i started writing. so what then? it's about the void. it's about self-destructive compulsions. people pick at scabs even though they know they shouldn't. or fail to wash their hands after urinating. we all know we should. some of us don't. why? is it just laziness? i think it's not just laziness. to wit: i've faked washing them for the benefit of others within earshot, which requires just as much effort as just lathering up, rinsing, and drying for real. i offer to you, the 15 people who still check in from time to time, the sum of my wisdom: some people don't wash their hands because they want desperately to test the notion that "bad" actions don't always have consequences, and neither do "good" actions, for that matter. in other words, a test of the basic tenets of what i'll call moral physics-- namely, that good people are rewarded and bad people are punished. some of us would be condemned by such a literal correspondence between actions and outcomes. and so we quietly resist: by not brushing after meals and still expecting to not get a cavity; by not doing our homework and still hoping to pass our classes; by playing a game we're doomed to lose and still praying to win. there is a kind of bravery in it, don't you suppose? i just made an awful realization about myself. awful enough to warrant my return to the internets. i'd been clean for a while, you know. just twenty minutes ago, i was lying on my couch with the sun in my eyes, too inept with the mechanics of vertical blinds to keep it out. i was mulling my options about what to do with the remainder of a sunday afternoon. the television was tempting, but again, this time of day was bad -- too sunny, too inept. the glare would prove unbearable. i scrolled through my cell phone's address book. someone to call? i didn't really want to make plans with anyone, mind you. i wouldn't want anyone to see me like this -- unshaven and disheveled. i just wanted someone to text message with. preferably a pretty girl. something to distract me, if only momentarily. distract me from what, you ask? the realization. that is, the realization that i don't enjoy doing anything. i have no hobbies. nothing that doesn't involve gambling (or at least uncertainty) interests me. since i am not supposed to gamble anymore, i'm a complete waste of space. ever the resilient one, i've found a cheaper and less satisfying alternative -- writing bizarre messages on craigslist.org and match.com, pleas for help, inflammatory poems, anything that might incite someone to write back. sometimes on match.com, after reading the tenth amazingly vapid 'portrait' in a row, i just start sending emails bitterly mocking them. that this sort of behavior fills the void that i used to fill by playing cards is noteworthy, i think. i am not putting anything at risk -- no money, obviously, but not even my ego. it's entirely anonymous. so i was never a risk junkie after all. i am a feedback junkie. i crave the moment when i realize that i have something to read from a stranger. preferably a pretty girl. it's got nothing to do with making a connection with someone. it's got everything to do with snapping me out of the boredom of sheer radio silence. it's a reminder that i am not dead yet. it gives me a way to keep score, to measure success and self-worth. especially when it's from a pretty girl. don't most people crochet, or play golf, or go to museums to have fun? i wish those were fun for me. if i can't get my dose of uncertainty, rejection, acceptance, excitement, self-esteem from gambling, then i'm going to get it from person-shopping on the internet. sadly, the ones who write back are usually overweight amd live in the suburbs with their parents. and that just makes me more depressed. god, i pity them so much. before we got rolling toward k.c., natalie tapped the dashboard. "we need to fill this bad-boy up! serious fillage ." even at this relatively early juncture, i had become entirely accustomed to her idiosyncratic grammar and syntax. she spotted a gas station adjacent to the southbound entrance to the interstate. after some fumbling with the credit card, the pump and the nozzle, we were ready. it was nearly dusk. she did the driving, while i navigated. "south for a while. mostly southwest," i announced, once we'd safely merged into the flow of traffic. "so just down and over, right?" "down and over? right, down and over." beginning a road trip of considerable distance with a relative stranger at this dangerous time of day gave me pause. the headlights hadn't completely taken full effect and it was hard for me to see. i figured it was hard for natalie to see. then she confirmed my suspicions. "whoa. it's hard to freakin' see. twilight and glare or whatever." "uh huh." in order to distract us from these annoynaces -- twilight? glare? whatever? -- natalie directed her attention to the car radio, to find some tunes. tuneage . all eyes turned to the radio. it was one that had come standard with the car, this powder blue monstrosity, this 1983 oldsmobile toronado in which we would soon die our fiery deaths. its pre-sets were shiny metallic buttons, spring-loaded so when you press a button, the one that was originally depressed comes popping out of its socket with a vehemence you can feel and hear. snap-click. anyone with half a brain when encountering such a contraption would try to hold down two of the buttons at once, just to see what might happen. "that's how things get broken." "uh huh." if i were to remove this gaudy button, there'd be nothing but a small plate with tiny copper hooks on either end -- one end held the plate to the aforementioned gaudy exterior buttons; the other end attached, ostensibly, to the radio's internal wiring. the shiny metal on the pre-set buttons was, as far as i could tell, there primarily to provide the passenger with some sense of psychological remove between the button itself (merely a symbol, really) and the mechanism, raw and cold, that lay underneath it. "and you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile. and you may find yourself in another part of the world." we sang along. i am thrilled to be back in a position to write more blog entries. i was involved in a pretty big misunderstanding in kansas city, missouri. before the kansas city fiasco will make any sense, though, you will have to know who natalie is. last week, natalie cut my hair at the local middle-brow hair salon chain, and we got to chatting the way stylists and clients will do, and i realized about five minutes into the conversation two things: (1) most of what was coming out of my mouth was utterly false; and (2) natalie was interested. i told her that i was on a medical leave from my job in houston, at nasa. "what do you do for nasa?" "i'm an astronaut." she pulled the scissors away. "psha! shut up!" i shut up. "seriously?" "well, no, but it's not as ridiculous as it sounds. i do work for them, for nasa, on a contract basis. mostly p.r. consulting, which is a year-round thing but gets especially hectic whenever there's a launch or a landing or anything. at more off-peak times, i call my friends at the newspapers, magazines, and the wire services and feed them 'feel-good' stories about the space program. seriously." "that's awesome." "what i tell people is that it's basically 40 hours a week trying to make the general public like rocket scientists." "i don't know, rocket scientists seem pretty likable to me as it is." "well, obviously i'm good at what i do, then." whenever i get bored and restless, whenever the prospect of going to bed at 9:30 terrifies me, i decide that i should either gamble or go to a bar. each offers such marvelous unknowns and opportunities. this is well-covered territory. so the other night i went to a local pub and had a few drinks. alone. watched the crowd. fiddled with my cell phone. pretended that someone was calling me, so as to allay my self-consciousness about being alone in a bar. i wanted to leave. i uttered some fake parting words to a friend who didn't exist to a cell phone that was off. i paid $6 for my beer. then i got the bright idea to take a cab to the only strip club i know about in this whole city. i knew it was a terrible idea, and an awful waste of my rather limited resources, but o, the possibilities! now, the interesting part: i hopped in a cab and told the driver the approximate intersection. i commented on the bouquet of roses that he had, bizarrely, attached to the dashboard. he didn't hear me. i repeated, "north and kingsbury." "v.i.p.'s? you going to v.i.p.'s?" my reflex on this evening, as it was on many evenings previous, was to lie. "oh, no. i'm not going there. that is a fun place though. just here at the corner, that's fine." and so he dropped me off and began to execute his u-turn and get back to a main thoroughfare. i began to cross the street and make my toward the neon, the techno, the cheap-looking silhouettes. i took two steps and realized that if i continued toward the club in plain view of the cabbie, i'd be confirming his (well founded) suspicion that i am a sleaze-bag who had just lied to him. so i changed course. i yawned. nonchalance is key. i pretended to get another phone call again, and i walked briskly. purposefully. away from the club. once the brakelights of the cab had gone safely over the hill about a quarter of a mile away, i figured the coast was clear. so i made a 180-degree turn and retraced my steps toward the club. i don't feel like telling you any gambling stories today. the sun is shining, the unreasonably loud construction outside of my apartment has ceased, and i feel good. i am eating healthier foods and taking better care of myself. i don't know why. part of it is simple. i'm so tired of gambling. i can finally see a way to where the pursuit of action won't be irresistible. i really can. mostly because i'm just flat exhausted. but that's where i have to stop. because if i continue this thread, it's only trouble for me. trouble because i start to realize that i have nothing with which to replace the monkey on my back, except maybe for a new monkey. (alcohol? drugs? hookers? greasy foods? i don't know, what else are people addicted to?) i'll make it as plain as i can: i have thus far been successful in making the idea of gambling utterly undesirable to me. that alone seems like a worthy achievement. but concomitant with that success is my realization that nothing else in life is all that desirable to me, either. it's as if -- in my haste to eradicate the gambling disease from my heart, my soul, my nervous system, whatever -- i've gone ahead and deadened everything -- including my ability to fathom that i live in a world from which i might derive enjoyment. so you tell me which is worse. last monday, i received something suspicious in the mail. it was a rumpled manila envelope to which electrical tape was nonsensically applied. there was no return address, but instead a cryptic "respondez si vous plait" in the upper-left corner. i hadn't been expecting any packages from psychopaths, so i thought twice about opening it. anthrax? a letter bomb, maybe? i couldn't be certain. "maybe someone out there thinks i'm worth more dead than alive," i wondered aloud, eyeing the lumpy, brown parcel. it was a flattering notion, in a way. it was a very film noir -ish line to deliver, and i think i nailed it on the first take. never mind for the moment that the proposition itself was utterly false. even if it were theoretically true that my value as a dead person exceeds my value alive, i reasoned that either value was probably less than that of the postage. simultaneously emboldened and deflated by this realization, i tore the package open and braced myself for the worst. enclosed was a homemade t-shirt, emblazoned with a fairly crass pun using the name of the boarding school that i attended. also, a bus ticket from here to a new england town, where the school is located and where the senders of this parcel still reside. they wanted me to go out there for the coming weekend. an informal reunion of former roommates, friends, and whatnot. they thought they'd have to entice me with gifts. they were right. some are beginning their medical residencies. others are working at financial services firms. they have nylon laptop bags with their firms' logos on them. they wear golf shirts. most are engaged or already married. i don't have to explain to you why this is awkward. most of them know my situation. in fact, one of them came up with the idea of the reunion because he saw this blog, put two and two together, and wanted to check in. he was good enough to keep the discovery of the blog to himself, or so he assures me. it's not awkward merely because these people have more money than me, or because they've done more with their lives than me thus far, although neither is ever comfortable. it's the little things. it's that their clothes just seem to sit right on their bodies more than mine do. they wear baseball caps that just look right on their heads. my head seems like it's a weird shape compared to theirs. none of them wears eyeglasses. i do. their hair is straight and looks sort of conventional. respectable. never too unruly, even if it gets windy outside. mine always looks a little off. their teeth are white. they are in better shape than me. they are good at their jobs. was my growth irrevocably stunted somehow? why do these little things come so easily to them? how come, for instance, they're not even interested in eating the fortune cookies at the chinese restaurant? i always feel like such a child when i'm the only one who eats mine as we deliberate about the size of the tip. i don't own a pair of sunglasses, but if i did it wouldn't occur to me to hang them nonchalantly off the collar of my polo shirt. but these guys make it work. i don't even have a driver's license. i guess i just never learned how. 
Female: 93%, Female, the novelista barista today featured me in her blog. i am extremely flattered by what she had to say. take a look!a 'catch-up' post is on the way, probably tomorrow... watch this space! x when i'm in malta, i generally avoid shopping like the plague. not only are most prices higher, the euro isn't exactly in my favour either. but last time i was there, i was determined to get my hands on the new chasing pandora cd, the driver and the dancer. and ever since then, i haven't really been able to turn it off. the distance between us is one of my very favourite songs off the album (although i love them all, which i cannot often say about an album). unfortunately i haven't been able to find the video online, but the entire cd can be heard (free!) on their website. musically, 
Female: 100%, Female,  added in a couple of items to the tiny lifestyle changes today. one i’ve been doing for a while and it is working well for me. the other is a suggestion made by my associate rector, matt, and it’s the kind of thing that would work for me if i did it regularly so i’m going to make the attempt to do that too. the one that i’m already doing is from my pastoral counselor. he suggested that to handle stress and anxiety, since it was keeping me awake at night, i should turn over to god the things that were bothering me most. he suggested a journal, but i’m just doing it in prayer. i’ve been negligent of my prayer life, so this is a good way to get back in the habit of talking to god. when i was a new believer i used to fall asleep reading his word. i sort of miss that comfort and i hope this tiny step will lead me back to that, or at least to more consideration in the quiet of the evening when i’m lying there trying to shut down my day. last sunday matt gave a really good sermon on that included 2 midrash. that’s may not be spelled correctly and it’s not the plural form. he told us during the sermon but i didn’t get that bit down. one of the midrash talked about the space between the lines of text in the torah being the place where the true meaning was to be found. then he talked about the name of god as it is in hebrew yhvh, which is never spoken, and what the sound might be if we did try to pronounce it. without the vowels that christians have added in it sounds sort of like breathy sounds that one hears. the ph sound, the h sound, maybe some of the s, those where you are exhaling strongly. i kind of laughed when he first did that and tried to say it without the vowels. it sounded like a bit from harry potter. then as his lesson continued i came to think, the breath sound might represent the breath of life that god gives us or that energy which was sent forth from god when he made the world. if that’s what we find in the quiet spaces maybe it’s a good idea that i go back and reread my priests’ sermons so that i can reflect on their teachings and gain what is between the lines of text. and that’s the second item i added into tiny lifestyle changes. peace! hope! &amp; joy! if you’ve read my blog a lot in the past you know i like to think back on things and see what effect they’ve had on my life. this is a skill i learned late in life. it was something i had to do for some college classes and believe i’m much the better for having gained it. the process was called reflection. reflection has given me lots of awareness on how things affect others too. when i was a child i didn’t spend time analyzing other people’s actions or emotions until it affected me and then it was usually a frenzy of trying to look at why they did or said whatever it was that had hurt me so badly. that’s not socially helpful, but it let me express my angst till i’d owned it and come to a better understanding of the situation. thankfully i’ve grown some since those anxious teenage years. these days i try to understand the other person’s needs or behaviors based on what i know of them and not how i feel. it helps a bunch because i’ve come to love harmony in my life, a gift from mom, and hopefully that longing for peace and harmony makes me more of a peacemaker than an irritant to any situation i run into. this morning i was reading an article from webmd that talked about a study researching the effects of darkness on people’s behavior. it said that when the room is darkened, not lightless but dim light, or people wore sunglasses they might behave in a less ethical manner. i found that very interesting and suddenly i was imagining what i might say to a child who wanted to wear sunglasses all the time because he, “thought it made him look cool” because another kid he knew wore them and he thought that kid was cool. i guess our teachers were right; you shouldn’t wear sunglasses all the time. since the eyes are windows to our heart and mind, if someone feels you can’t see what he’s thinking or feeling he feels anonymous and can thus act in ways that might not be right but won’t be attributed to him because of that self perceived anonymity. i think i can understand how a kid might want to be anonymous if he’s constantly being corrected for things he does. we probably all experience times like that as adults too. but knowing this means it’s important to look people in the eyes to really know them, that it can’t be done by just hearing their words without knowing the emotions behind them, or maybe the experiences that have generated their response to a situation. that’s not always easy to know even when you do look someone in the eye, but it gives you the opportunity to ask them for more so that they can express themselves and feel heard. i think that’s called active listening today and we all know how much we want to be heard when we are struggling. i want to go back to that darkness article and think up some more ways that it can affect us so i guess i’ll find a friend i can discuss that with, or maybe my counselor since he’s good at role play too. if you read the article on darkness and come up with any insights i hope you’ll share them. peace! hope! &amp; joy! it’s true! i’m almost giddy i’m so happy. this isn’t because of anything that’s happened. no major event triggered this. i think it’s the result of some small changes i made in my routine recently that have just triggered a good feeling within my spirit. the changes i made were very small. i’ve been dealing with depression ever since my marriage broke up in ‘99. i have a good counselor and maybe a very smart psychiatrist who prescribes my medication. so for the past 3 days i’ve been on a very small dose of bupropion. just 100 mg a day, extended release. this dose is small enough to not cause that edgy feeling that this drug is known for but it helps lift my spirits. i think it is taking effect. but i don’t think that alone has triggered this surfeit of happiness. the next change i made was last night’s routine. it was cold in the apartment so i took out time in the middle of the evening to draw and take a warm bath. i washed my hair and when i was through i put on comfy clothes and went to bed at my usual time, hair still wet but combed. when i woke up this morning i had more time in my routine to do stuff i wanted to do instead of feeling the need to get ready for work. my hair was dry and fluffy, call that wash and sleep. lol more time gives you a relaxed feeling about your day so that’s going to become a more regular change i think. bath at night and ready faster in the morning. plus i think i slept better for that. good sleep gives me a much better mood. then i elected to dress comfortably for work. i work in a business casual environment and some of my coworkers wear suits. i would have loved jeans today but it’s not jeans day so i pulled out an old pair of loose fitting pants that still looked good and topped them with one of those thin flannel shirts that gives you lots of room to move. added a belt and i”m ready for for anything and can move comfortably without care to whether i’m sitting like a proper lady and feeling cuddled in that flannel. i think that finished the mood lift. so clean, rested, comfortable, and ready to face the day. i attribute some of this to the happiness project . and i’m going to continue to read that blog because i keep finding good suggestions in it that lift my mood. hope your day goes as good as i anticipate mine will. peace! hope! &amp; joy! even though they’d been sniffing noses through the screen door and seemed interested in being friends, when i adopted hooboo, rescuing him from his “stray porch kitty” status, he and hyram developed an instant competition. they fought, hyram stole hooboo’s food, hooboo would steal the wrap around my ankles time, and they’d rarely share a bed together. hyram actually kept watch for hooboo’s arrival and left when he entered the room. that is until recently. i don’t know what changed but for the past two nights i’ve had both cats on the bed. sunday night it was one on either side of me. last night they were actually sharing the comforter and less than a foot apart. dare i hope that i’ve now got a cat family? in other news i’m fighting a cold and it’s taking its usual course. following a nurse friend’s advice i was trying to “let it run through me” and avoiding decongestants until the need for sleep precluded that and i gave in. prayers for health are appreciated. peace! hope! &amp; joy! recently i updated to the latest (greatest?) version of firefox, that being version 3.6. it immediately disabled ie tab and one or two other extensions a.k.a. add-ons. oops! i’d been using ie tab to see my blog because i thought there had been a problem with firefox and blogger. i’d been losing the right hand column of my blog in firefox and ie tab was my current workaround. then last night i opened and read sandi’s blog and heard her playlist which she has on the right side (same as i do) and wondered why i could hear her blog and not mine. so i started researching. the first thing i did was email terry to see if he had any advice. he took a look, with 4 different browsers no less, and had no problems with my blog so he suggested i clear the cache. that’s blogger’s usual advice too so i tried it but it didn’t help. then i got a clever idea. why not try disabling add-ons to see if any of them were the problem. wow, what i discovered would make almost 2 posts. first off i had way too many java consoles installed. apparently when you update java it doesn’t overwrite the old console but just adds a new one on. i’m down to just the latest java console and the java quick start add-on. that works fine so no problem there. then i disabled everything else and restarted the browser. my blog showed fully and the playlist i’d been missing played beautifully. so i started enabling add-ons one at a time and found the culprit. it was ad block plus. that’s a sweet add-on and i’m going to miss it because i hate ads being stuck willy nilly all over the pages i’m viewing and this baby took care of that. but lately it seems to be messing with java and flash content so i guess i’m better off without. then i googled “firefox add-ons that cause problems with blogger” and got this fantastic page by mozilla. it lists the extensions that cause problems, what they mess up, and gives a workaround. how helpful of them to put that up. it was even dated as recent as december 10, 2009 so it’s very current. yes, adblock and adblock plus were on the list. it also told me why my browser sometimes gave a message of firefox is still running when i’d shut it down and then tried to restart it. that little snafu was thanks to cooliris which is another neat add-on but i can do without too. so that’s gone now too. now my add-on list is much pared down and i’m happy with the way the browser is working again. i hope that link helps if you are having any problems with firefox. peace! hope! &amp; joy! it’s raining this morning, and in addition to the loving behavior of my younger cat hooboo making bread on my shoulder before settling down on top of me to await my arousal, i woke to thinking about blogging. it’s been more than a month since i wrote anything and i apologize to all of you who’ve been checking in from time to time. i titled this the “season of bloglessness” because i’m not the only one who hasn’t been blogging lately. my friend susan just posted after an absence of over two weeks and my good friend sandi has been absent from blog land for almost as long. i’ll let you read susan’s blog to find out what she’s been up to. sandi on the other hand is very busy with a no longer empty nest. her son wallace has moved back in. i’ll let sandi tell you the story but you need to know that her life is doing all kinds of adjusting right now, so if you read her blog please take the time to drop by and give her support. i know she means to get back to blogging sometime soon but her computer is in what is now wallace’s bedroom. my job is going well. i love what i’m doing and the people i’m working with. thank you for being so faithful. i’ll try to write again soon with pictures of the christmas poinsettias i was gifted with. blessings for now. life got rather busy a few weeks ago. i mentioned in an earlier post that the census had called and asked me to work for them again. the job kept getting postponed for a couple of weeks and that frustrated me some at the time. but the work finally started and it is still as much fun as it was earlier this year. the slow spell of the summer is over and we are gearing up to hire a lot of folk for the upcoming census taking. if you want a temporary job that pays fairly well and helps your government put resources where they are needed most then click here . one of the nice things i like about this job is there is so much to learn about the project. i’m a perpetual student and excel in learning environments. this one has a lot to teach me. the fact that we do a census every 10 years is dictated by law. i believe it’s written into the constitution. there is a deadline for it. the census totals need to be on president obama’s desk on a specific date in the middle of next december. the goal is to do a better job of counting every person in the country than they did in past decades. we are aiming for 100%! that 100 percent isn’t just those of us who live in houses or apartments. it includes trailer parks too. that i could have figured out. but for some reason i hadn’t figured on them counting campground dwellers, boat owners who live in them on the water, and people in care facilities like hospitals, retirement communities, and jails. and then there are the people who live in shelters, under bridges and overpasses, and in boxes. yep, we plan on counting them too. that thought brings to mind an old black and white movie image of hoboes around a campfire. i wonder if they will search railroad cars for people. that’s the main news on my front. i’m busy and feeling good about it. yay! other news is that my list of friends on facebook has grown. a bit of that is thanks to classmates.com. i’m reconnected with a few folks in my high school graduating class. that’s kind of neat and i’ll probably try to go to a reunion when they hold it. on a more interactive front an old college chum got in touch with me the same way. i'd not heard from harry in something close to 30 years but we were great friends when we attended the same college. he’s doing well and is in town for the holidays to see his mum. we are meeting for lunch tomorrow. i wonder what we will talk about. my dad sent me a box full of pictures from the family collection. he is scanning them into his computer and was just going to toss them so i asked if i could have them instead. yeah, i love a digital image and can look at one for hours if it’s really good. but just like books, a real photograph printed on paper is somehow more tangible and generates strong memories and emotions. guess i”m just an old fashioned girl when it comes to some things. i guess the last bit of news is that tonight i’m attending a celtic christmas concert at my church. the music i’ll hear is going to be performed by jeff johnson, brian dunning, and wendy goodwin. i hope to come away with a cd or two of their music. if you want to listen to some clips of their stuff the website is here . i’ll try to write about the concert and my impressions later this week. peace, hope &amp; joy! wednesday evening is practice night for my church choir, of which i’ve been a member for about a year. these days we are gearing up for the annual lessons &amp; carols service. it’s exciting because there are always lots of new numbers to sing and it is the choir showcase service. we are also thinking ahead to christmas eve service which also has lots of music in it. our choir director asked if any of us would be interested in doing some group numbers, not exactly solos but still out front and i said count me in. so this christmas i may be part of a trio singing a medley of carols. when choir practice was over we had a birthday celebration for anyone who’s birthday is in november and those we’d missed earlier in the year. this is renewing an old tradition among our group that fell into disuse and i think we are all happy to have it back again. everybody should have their special day. the members who volunteered to sponsor this month’s celebration brought wine, desserts, and some nice crackers, chips, and dips. it was all good. then we left for the evening. outside our sanctuary door there’s a motion activated security light. it’s dark earlier these days so i was glad that it came on as i headed out to my car. but apparently someone in the world wasn’t so happy. as i passed the tree on the corner of the building i heard a sound i’d never heard before. it was a sort of hooting. i stopped and listened and it happened again and again. it was an owl protesting about light disturbing his peace. in all my life i can’t remember ever having heard an owl before, but i recognized it immediately. perhaps there’s no other bird that sounds like that. maybe it’s so distinctive that once you’ve been told what an owl sounds like you can’t mistake that sound for any other bird. the moment made me feel very good. to know that nature was out there and active, that a bird i tend to think of as a wilderness creature was on our church grounds, made me aware of how special our sanctuary and grounds are. whenever i’m on our campus i feel blessed. there’s this feeling that just seems to fill the grounds up, not just the sanctuary. we call ourselves reconcilers and i think that sound served to remind me that we reconcile ourselves to nature too. the happiness project had an interesting post the other day about de-cluttering. it was rules to not follow. in it gretchen gave eleven myths of de-cluttering along with how we should not follow those old beliefs and why. i was surprised to find these out and have to admit that i’m guilty of believing and practicing many of them. maybe i can try out these new methods and get better results. what do you think? are you guilty of any of these? peace! hope! &amp; joy! 
Female: 100%, Male, note: this print has been sold.i've been ordering prints for a gallery showing this past week and i accidentally ordered one of the prints without matting (it's professionally framed and mounted to styrene, just not matted). whoops! if you want the above framed 10"x15" print of the aurora borealis over a barn in nebraska and are the first person to email me, you can have it for $60 with free shipping to anywhere in the united states. the usual price for this is $140 for just the print alone ($190 for framed), so it's a huge discount. again, if you're interested, email digicana@gmail.com -- there's only one, so first come, first serve! btw, the shadows of the trees on the barn are a bit of a funny story -- they weren't visible to the naked eye when taking the picture and only showed up later in the photo. they are caused by the distant light of lincoln, nebraska reflecting off of a cloud over the city; the lit up cloud was bright enough to cast a shadow in the long exposure.note: this print has been sold. here's an old favorite from near comstock, nebraska. this storm put down a quarter mile wide tornado about 20 or 30 minutes before this was shot -- here it is moving off into the distance. sometimes the "golden hour" light of a setting sun into a storm can create incredibly beautiful vistas that seem straight out of an apocalypse.
Female: 100%, Female,  when the brisbane roar had finished their practice session we decided to go over to see if we could meet some players. geraldo was particularly interested in meeting some brazilian players who were on the team. most of the players had gone into the change room by the time we had walked over from the other side of the stadium but we were lucky enough to meet a couple of the brazilian players who were talking to the coach. i told them that geraldo was a top ranking soccer player in his hometown in vanuatu and they were very friendly and were happy for us to take some snaps. the coach whose name was kenny seemed very interested in geraldo and he suggested i call his friend, david, a soccer coach at the academy of sport to see if he could include geraldo in some training sessions before he went back to vanuatu which was a week away. he said there was another ni-van boy who was in the training squad there. wow we couldn't believe our luck! we managed to get another photo of geraldo with a gorgeous aussie player before we left. we drove over to ballymore stadium which wasn't too far and found out the brisbane roar did their soccer training at 9:30am in the morning so we all came back the next day to see them practice. geraldo was very excited and watched them intensely. we decided that since geraldo was such a keen soccer player that we should take him for a visit to the suncorp stadium where the big soccer games are played. the stadium itself was locked up but we could see into it from the stadium shop. of course the stadiums in vanuatu don't look like this! the fellas who were serving in the shop were very friendly and when we told them that geraldo was a soccer player from vanuatu they suggested we take him to another stadium called ballymore where the brisbane roar, brisbane's top soccer team, practised. on the way home on the citycat geraldo was in high spirits. he was really enjoying his stay with us in brisbane! our next excursion with geraldo was to take him to the cinema. geraldo had watched plenty of dvds but had never been to a cinema before as there aren't any in vanuatu. we chose to take him to a 3d screening of avatar at south bank which pretty much blew his mind. for the best view of brisbane we drove geraldo up to the mt cootha lookout. there are wonderful views of the city and surrounding areas. you can see as far as the glass house mountains to the north, the gold coast hinterland to the south and moreton and stradbroke islands to the east. as usual he was pretty knocked out! we actually managed to spot our house through binoculars. after our bike run we decided to take geraldo to kangaroo point to check out the views. kangaroo point is situated on top of a cliff which is now the major rock climbing attraction for brisbane's abseilers. geraldo was pretty keen on the view. geraldo was really overwhelmed by south bank. he just kept saying "oh man!!" he just loved the man made swimming beach. the beach consists of a beautiful clear fresh water lagoon with views over the brisbane river to the city. surrounding landscape consists of white sandy beaches, bubbling creeks and shady tropical gardens. he couldn't believe the children's water playground either which i have to admit is pretty cool. 
Female: 100%, Female,  my mom came up to the city over the weekend to celebrate her birthday. the weather was gorgeous and we ended the afternoon with tea and cupcakes. millie and i are planning a trip to madrid and paris later this year. i know it's a ways off but working at a hospital requires quite a bit of notice when i need an extended period of time off, at least according to my boss. of course i'm getting antsy and ready for another vacation even though i was recently abroad; must be spring fever, or just my constant urge to travel. this picture is from a brief trip i took to barcelona a few years ago, the nouveau architecture was so gorgeous. at least i have several months to practice my spanish. i think about you all the time and wish you were still here. i went to see my friend joyce this past weekend in palo alto. we went to some consignment shops loaded with designer goodies and i managed to get a practically brand new chanel bag for just over $100. while on our little thrifting spree we drove past this amazing apartment building where i had to stop and get a closer look, i felt like i was back in paris. i've been thinking about painting my living room coral or a salmon color which is what i did in my last apartment. it's pretty, goes well with antiques, and it's a soothing color. my only reservations are that i've been living in my place for 7 years and hate the idea of moving everything and taking all my pictures down even though my walls are dingy and could really use some fresh paint. maybe i'll decide by spring time. the fashion world will not be the same without you. 
Female: 100%, Female, you're in austin. you're about to see an ass load of indie bands perform out of every nook and cranny of this city. it's 95 degrees, then it suddenly hails, then it goes back to 95 degrees with a humidity index of 99%. you spot a boy who wears a smaller jean size than you and you are determined to make out with him by the end of the night. it's late, you're drunk off of lone stars because you only had seven breakfast tacos about twelve hours ago, and you have blisters lining the bottom of your feet. these are questions and scenarios that will arise this week during sxsw. don't be unprepared! follow my survival guide list below and you're sure to have a worth-while and healthy sxsw experience. 1.) the fanny pack - fuck purses. who said these ever went out of style? who? tell me! i recommend the american apparel shiny denim fanny pack in royal blue because it's awe-inspiring. look at it. look at it! pretty. 2 .) a pair of tom's shoes - never mind. these hipster staples are like having a thin layer of burlap separating you from the ground. i can't believe they're donated to a child every time a pair is sold. the next generation is going to grow up all jacked with arthritis. (-this statement is in jest...tom's is a great company that does a lot of wonderful things) 3.) cheap brightly colored wayfarers - because in a way we're all still stuck in 2004, aren't we? 4.) cardigan - texas weather is known to be a fickle one, so make sure to carry around a cardigan with you for night or when it spontaneously rains though the precipitation level is 0%. also, throwing on a cardigan over any shitty ol' outfit, will suddenly make you look more intelligent than you actually are. 5.) clean underwear - 'cause lord only knows what you're going to do with your current pair of underwear. 6.) scrunchies - ladies, you make fun of them, but you know you secretly love them. who is going to hold back your hair when you're puking up all that free hornito's in the beauty bar toliet? not that dj with the florescent bike cap. he's been eyeing the girl with the non-prescription horn-rimmed glasses that are over-taking her face all night. you always have a friend in the scrunchie.&nbsp; 7.) fake mustache - because you don't want to feel left out in this city. 8.) business cards - business cards legitimize you. even if you have nothing to sell.&nbsp; 9.) granola bars - the nice thing about austin is that we're not a bunch of assholes that bump up the price of everything while you're visiting. however, your eating times might be off and in order to not get wasted by 4pm, it's worth carrying some snacks around with you (dear lord. i sound like my mother). 10.) water- blah blah blah boring 11.) $1's - for when you wander off alone to the strip club near the airport during a drunken blackout. right, marcos? 12.) air mattress - often enough couches are better than air mattresses. most of the time you wake on the hard wood floor, the mattress having deflated like that of your hard-on after popping way too many adderall. however, the couch might already be taken by the time you get there, so make sure you come prepared.&nbsp; 13.) chapstic k - because by the end of the night, your mouth is going to look like that of a crusty crack addict. 14.) condoms 15.) diana camera - to commemorate the night you get shit-faced with bill murray or corner david byrne up against a wall and explain to him how you two were always meant to be together...in lo-fi. not that long ago, i received an email from an austin-based musician very eloquently sharing with me the day he realized he was a hipster. his words were poignant, describing his realization as though he was suddenly inflicted with an incurable disease- hipstermystalacosis. i related to his story and i think you will too. when i was thirteen and running around in suspenders and non-prescription eyeglasses, i knew there was a name for me. for years i fought the label, but gave up my denial of being a hipster when i christened the name of my blog hipstercrite. now when someone calls me a hipster, i shake my head in agreement. i am a hipster and probably always will be. hipsters, stand up tall! unite! dear lauren, i've been an admirer of your page for a few months. i was linked through "tapebombs," a music blog run by an acquaintance of mine. like you, i am dangerously preoccupied with hipsterism and spend a good deal of my day confronting the issue. the reason i am mailing is because i think i represent an interesting case study: a person caught in the paralyzing fear of his latent hipsterism and shocked into his true identity by a harrowing event. here is my account: i was riding my bike down duval and the sun was out. at this point i believed firmly in my individuality. of course, my handlebar wrap matched my brake housing, and the same with the metal cages that held my water bottles; all were red. i wore purple shoes and no helmet. the memory of a triumphant sexual encounter arose quickly, then left. i was pleased with my performance and didn't dwell on the details, didn't analyze a thing. i only recalled the sensations and sounds that make good sex memorable. the day was warm. readjusting my fingers on bar, i found them to be quite cool; i hadn't begun to sweat. the best part of the ride. in the first few seconds of what would be the minute and a half that changed my life, i didn't recognize the origin of the rumble, growing closer, rapidly becoming a roar, like the slow onset of a far off thunderclap. the sound came from the twin tail pipes of a chevy diesel truck. suddenly, they were upon me. as i turned down a steep hill near 51st and lamar, i was forced against the curb. the huge wheels of the truck kicked up dust and rocks and i was struck by a few of them. a large white male leaned out of the passenger window, ejecting a thimble-full of spit across the front of my shirt. a beer bottle whizzed over my head. i felt like a frightened russian hussar riding against napoleon, holding out my hand as if to protect myself from the zip of bullets and the whistle of passing artillery. at this point, about a foot separated my handle-bars and the side of the truck. after a few more terrifying seconds, the truck sped up quickly, finishing the descent and pulling into a parking lot at the bottom of the hill. i knew what they had in mind. but remember, i was not some pussy hipster. i was not androgynous. i was a man. that archaic sense of honor strengthened me. four men stepped out (the type of men who buy their groceries at the county feed store). they came at me from thirty yards away, not running, but at a kind of a trot, like this was a leisure activity. i lept off of my bike and approached them in the middle of the lot. i put my dukes up, lithely shifting from side to side with the assured stance of an experienced boxer. i think they sensed my confidence, baseless as it was. they stopped about ten feet away. i held my ground. each wore what looked to be an ed hardy tee. only i didn't sense the danger then. i was like a cornered puma, fiercer because death clears away the vale of fear. underneath the decorated tees, the four mens limbs were taut and ready. one word, one altered expression would have uncapped that explosive energy. but there was silence. the crack of bat, followed by childrens laughter, echoed from the top of the hill. we measured one another. it was the leader who broke the silence. his followers relaxed. the engagement was apparently broken off, or at least postponed for a moment. he said, " fuck you, limp dicked hipster." his friends didn't laugh, but chimed in. "pussy! hipster! faggot!" i didn't reply. i had relaxed my stance. the passenger side agitator spat at me again, but missed. twenty seconds later the truck was gone and i was left alone in the bright sun. my world view was completely fucking shattered. what passed through my mind as i gingerly pedaled home was not so much the glorious afterglow of a manly confrontation, but the providential nature of my lot in life. i knew that, so far as the outside world was concerned, i was a hipster. whatever innate qualities i possessed were in dichotomous opposition to a certain portion of society, whose hatred of my "type" acted as a form of self-actualization. this tension was absolutely necessary, and in a larger sense, determined my ultimate role in history. i still have not recovered, not fully. now, when i listen to my own music, songs like "don't try and take my guns," "burning panties," and "you should start a band," i do not hear the voice of myself, but someone who struggles to hide the mark of an old wound. and while i am ashamed and at times it all seems clownish and sad, i remember that this is what makes good art - that is, fear and its poignant beauty, like a shivering mouse you've caught in a beam of light. my story is that of the reluctant hipster. in your word, "pretending we're not hipsters is what we do best." in this way, i am surely the most resourceful of hipsters. but, unlike so many others, it has enriched my art and given me a new purpose; or more nearly, an enhanced clarity of vision. sincerely, marshall galactic of the frontier brothers marshall

things are kind of nutty here with sxsw, so while i work on a bunch of posts for next week, please read a little love letter i wrote to austin a few months ago. stopped at a traffic light last friday afternoon, i glanced up at a familiar restaurant marquee that usually carried a quip relating to the latest music festival/bike rally/music rally/bike festival in austin that week. however, this time the words bore a different sentiment: "go texas! win it for leslie !" the light turned green and i found myself driving south down congress avenue with tears pooling at the bottom of my eyelids. every austinite knows who leslie is. he is the city mascot. the epitome of what makes austin unique. for those who do not know him, leslie cochran is a homeless man who wears a leopard print thong. he has run for city mayor multiple times and has been reviewed 53 times on yelp . he is an extremely articulate and sweet-natured man. no one has a bad thing to say about leslie. which is why it's so surprising that unnamed assailants beat leslie to unconsciousness two weeks ago. leslie was in bad shape and listed in critical condition. the townspeople formed a vigil and the local news gave daily updates on his health. it was looking like leslie was not going to make it, but miraculously he pulled through and was released from the hospital last week. he has since thanked the locals for their support, stating that he would have not made it through otherwise. though a percentage of his medical bills have been taken care of, there will be a fundraiser on november 1st to help pay the rest. by the time i read the sign last friday, i knew that leslie was alive and well. what made me tear up was the realization that i live in a town that cares immensely for an eccentric homeless man. it's also a city where that same homeless man can run for mayor multiple times and still get thousands of votes. last month marked my one year anniversary of moving to austin. i moved here with no road map and only what i could fit in my car. the plan was to stay a few months and then see where my add took me next. however, whatever energy that made me curious enough to move here has made me stay here. i could tell after my first night in austin that i was someplace special and i haven't wanted to leave since. each day this city inspires me more and more and at moments i can honestly say that i'm in love (that could also be because i haven't had a boyfriend in a long time). so in honor of this city that took me in with open arms after fleeing a tumultuous relationship with los angeles, i will begin using this blog for part-time austin "goings-on", part-time hipstercrite musings. not sure who the owner of this picture is, but thanks everyone ought to have a lower east side in their lif e- irving berlin the east side has typically been synonymous with art, culture, history, and grit. when we venture through les in nyc or wicker park in chicago or silver lake in los angeles, we feel like we've stepped back into time, that we're not necessarily welcome, and that at any moment something wonderful or terrible might happen. this also goes for austin's east side. a vibrant and fascinating part of the city, eastside boasts eclectic eateries, trendy bars, and dozens of notable art galleries all maintaining the feel of a bygone era. chances are you'll be spending some time over on the eastside during sxsw and if so, you might want to know where to eat (if you aren't stuffed full of free breakfast tacos supplied at the parties). here is a list of some of the best east austin restaurants, cafes, and bars: best pizz a: east side pies 1401 rosewood ave. many will say that homeslice on soco is the best pizza in austin, but they're embarrassingly wrong. east side pies is hands down the best and most imaginative pizza around. try their veggie nacho pizza topped with spicy black bean sauce, onion, tomatoes, jalapenos, and avocados. or their blue moon which is a tomato-less pizza topped with feta, mozzarella, ricotta, goat, romano , and blue cheeses. they also supply delicious salads, blondie brownies, and bottled sodas. the staff is awesomely sassy and the place is a little small and very busy, so make sure you don't dilly-dally. price: cheese slice $2.50/meat or veggie slice $3.00 best vegan/vegetarian: mr. natural 1901 e. cesar chavez one of two mr. natural locations in austin, this restaurant is conveniently located in the heart of the east side. both a restaurant and a health food store, mr. natural supplies an assortment of food options ranging from a vegan/vegetarian lunch and dinner bar that changes daily to delicious baked goods to cakes to homemade juices. absolutely worth trying is the soya guisada on fridays and the vegan mint chocolate cupcake. you will never think of veganism the same way again. price: lunch buffet $7.99, pastries range from .75-$3.50 best mexican : juan in a million 2300 e. cesar chavez this was a hard category to decide in. i like a lot of mexican food on the eastside : aranda's simplicity, el chile's creativity, and all the taco trailers in between. i chose juan in a million because it's the most famous mexican food restaurant on the eastside , having been featured on the travel channel's man vs. food and countdown chowdown . juan in a million is most famous for their "don juan", a potato, bacon, egg, and cheese scramble that, which i believe, has been cooked on the same griddle for over twenty years. it's also $3.60 and could last you two days! the atmosphere is quaint, but make sure to go at off times. especially on the weekend, lines can form down the sidewalk! price: the don juan $3.60 best sandwich: bossa nova 2121 e. 6 th st. located across the street from the lance armstrong foundation, this brazilian eatery has some of the best food on the east side. don't let the fact that it's brazilian scare you away- their menu is plentiful and delicious while still being unique. my favorite sandwich (when i eat meat) is the misto tudo which has turkey, ham, sliced egg, green olives, palm, and mozzarella. or the salada de maca with romaine, apples, cranberries, walnuts, blue cheese, and balsamic dressing. price: lunch special- any 1/2 sandwich or pizza slice with a side salad or soup $6.99 best coffee : texas coffee trader s 1400 e. 4 th st. texas coffee traders is quite possible my favorite place to visit on the eastside . often overlooked due to the fact that it's housed in a warehouse, this place is not to be missed. a disneyland for the coffee connoisseur, texas coffee traders has rows and rows of unique coffee to taste and buy. typically a place to get your coffee in bulk, the friendly staff will fix you up a cup of cappuccino or tea while you wait. however, this year for sxsw, the store will be setting up a coffee stand on the corner of 4th and navasota, so make sure to check them out! these guys will remind you of why you love austin. most romantic: justine's 4710 e. 5 th st. justine's is relatively new to the eastside , but a wonderful addition. situated in an old house, the ambiance of justine's is quaint and warm. one enters below a vintage neon sign onto a front yard draped with string lights and tables. inside the dark wood and vaulted ceiling of the house make for a cozy atmosphere. justine's is a great place to grab a drink or dine in. inspired by french cuisine, my favorites include the endive poire rouqefort salade (endives, rouqefort , walnuts, and pear) and the steak tartare . price: endive poire rouqefort salade $8.50, steak tartare $14 most metropolitan: east side show room 1100 e. 6 th st. east side show room is also a relatively new to the eastside . channeling a 1920's feel, the bar/restaurant showcases vintage furniture and fixtures, local art, and some of the best lighting in town. east side show room is also one of the best places to see and be seen these days. the menu is a little steep, but definitely creative and delicious. their curried grits and greens is a must, as is their barbequed quail and oranges. price: curried grits &amp; greens $9, barbequed quail &amp; oranges $18 most chill: rio rita 1308 e. 6 th st. rio rita has quickly become of of my favorite hangout spots on the eastside . cafe by day, lounge by night, this funky bar looks like an explosion went off in a vintage furniture store. rio rita serves a collection of local food, infused vodkas, and mystery beers. on monday night you can listen to your own 45 for "love and a 45" night or bring your crayons and glue for "arts and drafts" night on thursdays. this is definitely a great place to kick back and mingle with the quirkiest of the bunch. price: ham &amp; brie sandwich $6.50, turkey &amp; cranberry on a croissant $6.50 photo source: yelp.com do you have that one dress, one pair of hot pants, or that one hat that always compels people to stop you, grab you arm, and say in a low voice, "where on earth did you get that?" well i just found me a pair of socks that garnered lots of comments at whole foods yesterday ('cause you have to look good when you go to whole foods). and an awkward run-in with a security guard at wells fargo. the security guard was sitting on a bench, and i think she quietly said, "i like your boots" (meaning she liked my awesome kick-ass lace-up slippers) as i walked by. i didn't quite hear what she said, so i turned and gave a slight smile. the sort of smile that says, "i have no idea if you were talking to me or not, but here, here is a half smile to sort of acknowledge what you said". i started obsessing over whether or not she was talking to me and i started to sweat. i wanted to walk up to her and say, "thank you!", but the time for that had past and i started to rock back and forth in line. when i left the bank and nodded to her, she stared at me stone-faced and i was convinced that she now hated me for giving her a half-ass smile in return for her very sweet compliment. so you wanna know what socks will get you compliments at whole foods and awkward larry david-like situations at banks? the lacy lace-up slipper socks by sock theory . the best part? they're $7. they also come in white. make sure to check out sock theory' s broad collection of unique socks, leg warmers, arm warmers, knee-highs, and panty-hose. definitely my new favorite online store. here are few pics of me wearing my new lace-up's. i had to cut my head out because the sun was so bright yesterday, between my squinting and scrunched up mouth while squinting, i looked like what would happen if renee zellweger and sloth procreated. also, i don't shine my shoes. obs. first post in my austin, tx series for sxsw it's that time of year again. the time of year where you stock up on your adderall or xanax or xantac or horse tranquilizers and set your facebook tagged photos to private. south by southwest interactive and film will be starting this friday, with the music portion beginning next wednesday. what does that mean for you? that means your chances of getting drunk with bill murrary or hooking up with a hipster from brooklyn who is in a band with the words "bear", "deer", "neon", "gold", or "black" in it have just improved. if you're new to austin, here is a list of traits that make our town so unique. come and join the fun! 1.) the entire city collectively waits with bated breath for the groupon of the day. 2.) at anytime in anyplace, your chances of hearing new order playing on the sound system are 2 to 1. 3.) we treat music festivals like national holidays (and we really don't have a choice). 4.) overhear conversations that start with, (person looking at their iphone), "oh, looks like brooklyn vegan is following me on twitter. cool." (overhear= i said it yesterday). 5.) facebook comments like, "there is a little kids choir singing flaming lips and wilco at my place of employment right now." 6.) every single person has a mustache and we have competitions once a month to see who has the best. photo by alison narro 7.) a 24 hour pecan vending machine in the middle of nowhere. 8.) we eat migas for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and we can tell you exactly where in town the best migas are located. 9.) the rivers in austin are made of beer and you can often find us knelt in the river bed, stuffing our goard like augustus gloop in willy wonka. 10.) we quietly judge each other on the make of our bicycles and nothing else. 11.) the older and more worn your clothing is, the more street cred you have. 12.) we do a lot of our business out of airstream trailers. mostly for aesthetic purposes. the south by southwest festival in austin, tx will be starting this friday. i plan on devoting most of the week to austin and sxsw posts. however, i haven't written a single thing yet! in the meantime, please enjoy this gallery of maurizio cattelan's work. i learnt of cattelan this weekend while in houston. the menil collection is currently exhibiting some of his pieces. i'm still brewing what i think about him. what are your thoughts? you have nine followers, and one of them is your mother. you wonder why the hell you're even blogging. you speculate if anyone will ever read your words. you ponder if life is worth living. well look no further! listed below are twelve sure-fire ways to drive traffic to your blog and instantly boost your self-worth. 1.) join blogging network sites - the best blog networking website is twenty-something bloggers. hands down. joining 20sb opened up a whole new world for me. before then, i had no idea how to discover other blogs. 20sb is a supportive and strong community of like-minded bloggers. i can't recommend it enough. other blogging networks include blog lovin ', blog her , blogcatalog , and my blog log . 2.) write interesting content - as much as want to go into great detail about your recent trip to the dentist or how you wrapped your christmas gifts, refrain from it. truthfully, nobody cares. unless the dentist had a boner while performing your root canal or you lobbed off your finger while cutting wrapping paper for you gifts...then we might be interested. humor is a guaranteed way to enter the hearts of millions. take for example hyperbole-and-a-half . you could learn a lot from her. 3.) write about a trend topic - i don't adhere to this rule at all, but it's definitely a way to create buzz on your blog. commenting on the cultural importance of "jersey shore" or how justin bieber looks like he should be on the "l word" is a good way to start a convo. 4.) befriend other bloggers - the blogging community is a tight-knit one. i have met people that i'm convinced sat next to me at the algonquin roundtable in another life. these people have encouraged me to grow as a writer and have supported and advertised my work. i wouldn't be where i am today without them and i try to do the same for them. as the beatles once said, "the love you take is equal to the love you make". 5.) leave comments - bloggers love comments like mickey rourke loves ghastly printed button-ups. our self-esteem begins to slowly hinge on how many comments are left on our blog a day. if you comment on our blog, we will love you forever and most likely return the favor. 6.) brand yourself- the general consensus on this seems to be "yucky", but i disagree. the more polished the blog is, the greater the chance a reader will take it more seriously, no? having a "brand" shows the world that you are legit. does it take away from the personal aspect of blogging? sometimes. but this is where you have to get clever in how you brand yourself. subliminal branding. 7.) photos! - photos are a win-win all 'round. photos grab attention. photos can often work in substitute of text (tumblr?). photos can inspire. i try to put a picture in every single one of my posts, even if it's not necessary. like a picture of my ass. 8.) lists - we seem to really like lists. they're easy to read and typically very visual. remember, the average internet reader's attention span is like 45 seconds (i made that up). it's kind of true though. think of some of your favorite posts on buzzfeed or ew.com . short and sweet lists. 9.) connect with your audience- one of the most talked ideas running through the marketing world these days is lady gaga's rise to fame due in part to her fan interaction and loyalty. dodo like gaga. also, the blogs that appear to have the most comments are blogs where the writer shares a part of him/herself with the readers in the post, then interacts with them via the comment box. personal is good, but don't forget rule #2. 10.) self promote, but only 20% of the time - nobody likes a showoff. however, who is going to know about your blog if you don't say anything? i know some very humble bloggers who haven't even told anyone that they have a blog! you have to walk a fine line here. tweet or fb that you have a new post up, but don't send personal messages to strangers telling them to check out your blog. nobody likes that. in fact, we'll purposely not go check out your blog. 11.) believe that your traffic will go up- i know it can get discouraging at times, but don't give up. people want to hear what you have to say. if you believe that your blog will be successful, it most likely will. power of suggestion. 12.) post a picture of your ass keep me posted on your progress! i'm curious to hear. 
Male: 100%, Male,  civil court's jurisdiction - companies bill, 2009? - corporate law articles - chartered accountants india,taxpayers, cas india, ca india ,icai, company secretary ,cs, cost accountants, mba, finance professionals by durga rao we all aware that there is no express provision barring the civil courts to entertain certain company disputes under the companies act, 1956. we have been seeing the cases where the civil court entertains company disputes if there is no specific remedial measure before the company law board or the company court . the issue of civil court’s jurisdiction to entertain certain company matters is also supported by the constitutional courts on the ground that there is no specific bar under the existing companies act, 1956 barring the civil courts in entertaining company matters and on the ground that the companies act, 1956 do no provide all remedial measures to all the shareholders before the company law board or the company court. it is true that adjudicating a company dispute requires specialization and the civil court may not effectively adjudicate a company dispute. we are all aware of the inevitable complications under company law. laudably, an effort has been made to bar the civil court ’s jurisdiction to entertain company matters in the companies bill, 2009 or in the proposed new companies act replacing companies act, 1956. section 391 of the companies bill, 2009 dealing with the civil court ’s jurisdiction is extracted below: “391. no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which the tribunal or the appellate tribunal is empowered to determine by or under this act or any other law for the time being in force and no injunction shall be granted by any court or other authority in respect of any action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any power conferred by or under this act or any other law for the time being in force by the tribunal or the appellate tribunal”. the object of section 391 in the proposed companies act is to exclude the civil courts in entertaining company disputes and to avoid the jurisdictional ambiguity. under the existing companies act, 1956, shareholders who are qualified to approach the company law board under section 397/398 may choose to approach the civil court rather the company law board. in cds financial services (mauritius) limited vs. bpl communications limited and others, (2004) 121 comp cases 375 , it was held that “when there is no express provision excluding the jurisdiction of the civil courts, such exclusion can be implied only in cases where a right itself is created and the machinery of enforcement of such right is also provided by the statute. if the right is traceable to the general law of contracts or it is a common law right, it can be enforced through the civil court, even though the forum under the statute also will have jurisdiction to enforce that right. sections 397, 398 and 408 of the companies act, 1956, do not confer exclusive jurisdiction on the company court to grant reliefs against oppression and mismanagement. the scope of these sections is to provide a convenient remedy for minority shareholders under certain conditions and the provisions therein are not intended to exclude all other remedies”. now, with the express bar under section 391 of the proposed act, if a remedy is available before the national company law tribunal etc. then, no civil court can entertain a suit. but we need to address an issue as to what is the situation if a particular relief is not available to the shareholders before the national company law tribunal or under the new companies act? under such circumstances, despite section 391 in the proposed companies act, it may be very difficult to bar the civil courts in entertaining company disputes or it may be difficult to lay down a proposition that no shareholder can approach the civil court against the managerial personnel, the management or the company. it is true that the civil court may not be effective like the proposed national company law tribunal, but, when a remedy is not provided before the tribunal, the shareholders will obviously be approaching the civil courts and it may even be supported by the constitutional courts in future. it is true that the civil courts jurisdiction is effectively barred under certain enactments like securitization law and it is not usual to see a civil court to entertain a dispute under securitization act upon which the debt recovery tribunal shall have jurisdiction. it is possible under the securitization law in view of the limited scope of the subject matter. under securitization law, it is only about the determination of debt or the legality of the action taken by the bank under the act. only the bank, the borrowers, the guarantors and in some cases a third party, is interested in a securitization case, but, that is not the case with a company litigation. the company law board, company court or the national company law tribunal as the case may be should consider many issues before passing an order in a company dispute. in my opinion, it is very difficult to bar the civil court ’s jurisdiction as intended with section 391 of the proposed company’s bill or the new act. in order to achieve the objective of barring the civil court’s jurisdiction effectively, we need a detailed provision barring the civil court’s jurisdiction and there should be a provision similar to section 151 of c.p.c in the proposed companies act giving liberty to the shareholders or the members to approach the tribunal for the relief which is not specifically provided under the act. if there is such an arrangement under the proposed act, the national company law tribunal shall decide the maintainability of the applications or the petitions and can pass appropriate orders. i am sure that it is very difficult to bar the civil court ’s jurisdiction as intended with section 391 of the proposed bill or the proposed new companies act. there tend to be lot of litigation on the issue of civil court’s jurisdiction even after the new companies act coming into force replacing companies act, 1956. note: i have expressed my opinion on the issue and i am aware of the complications in company law. by &nbsp; durga rao &nbsp;on caclub india pil says cannot have mosque in hindu area, hc says intolerance has to go a resident of a hindu-dominated locality in navi mumbai has challenged the construction of a mosque; the bombay high court has told her such intolerance has to go. the petition, filed by sumitra kadu of sector 50e, nerul, alleges that cidco given a muslim trust a 1042.27-sq-metre, reserved plot. her advocate, g n salunke, told the court wednesday that not one muslim family lives in a radius of 1 km from the site and only 331 muslim families live beyond that radius. “if the mosque is allowed there is every possibility of encroachment on the public open premises in the locality by muslim encroachers which may badly affect the development of the city,” says the petition, heard by a division bench of justice f i rebello and justice j h bhatia. “so minorities cannot have their own place of worship? this intolerance has to go. either we should live together or pack our bags and go,” the bench said. kadu contends she is a project-affected person and 12.5 per cent of the area was reserved for their rehabilitation which has not been completed yet. her lawyer said the police commissioner has repeatedly stated there is likely to be a law-and-order problem if construction of the mosque is allowed, yet cidco has handed over the plot to the trustees of the mosque. “public in the locality is very much annoyed and aggressive and there is every possibility to riot and in law-and-order point of view the allotment is required to be cancelled,” the pil states. it says the trustees are neither project-affected persons nor residents of sector 50e. the construction of the mosque, it says, will affect the construction of a college the land was reserved for. the plot is also a mangroves bed but permission has not been sought to hack it, the pil adds. the court directed cidco to file an affidavit and submit a map of the area in two weeks. the court also told salunke and the cidco counsel to come up with a workable solution. types of grievances brought u/s 482 cr.p.c. here is the list of orders of lower court s/ magistrates against which applications are normally filed before the high

court vicarious liability of directors u/s 141 of n.i act,1881-gui vicarious liability of directors u/s 141 of n.i act,1881-guidelines of supreme court the hon’ble supreme court in its recent judgment in national small industries corp. ltd. vs. harmeet singh paintal and anr., pronounced on 15.02.2010 has laid down guidelines to determine vicarious liability of directors of company. the sc has significantly narrowed down the liability of directors. it was held that only those to be held responsible who were in charge of the conduct of business at that relevant time. the apex court held that from the provisions of section 141 ni act, it is clear that that the persons who are sought to be made vicariously liable for a criminal offence under section 141 should be, at the time the offence was committed, was in-charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company. every person connected with the company shall not fall within the ambit of the provision. only those persons who were in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of commission of an offence will be liable for criminal action. it follows from the fact that if a director of a company who was not in- charge of and was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time, will not be liable for a criminal offence under the provisions. the liability arises from being in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time when the offence was committed and not on the basis of merely holding a designation or office in a company. the apex court further observed that section 141 is a penal provision creating vicarious liability, and which, as per settled law, must be strictly construed. it is therefore, not sufficient to make a bald cursory statement in a complaint that the accused director is in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company without anything more as to the role of the director. but the complaint should spell out as to how and in what manner the accused director was in-charge of or was responsible to the accused company for the conduct of its business. this is in consonance with strict interpretation of penal statutes, especially, where such statutes create vicarious liability. a company may have a number of directors and to make any or all the directors as accused in a complaint merely on the basis of a statement that they are in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company without anything more is not a sufficient or adequate fulfillment of the requirements under section 141. the apex reiterated its own catena of decisions, in which it has held that for making directors liable for the offences committed by the company under section 141 of the act, there must be specific averments against the directors, showing as to how and in what manner the directors were responsible for the conduct of the business of the company. the supreme court after reiterating its own judicial pronouncements in various decisions laid down the following principles: (i) the primary responsibility is on the complainant to make specific averments as are required under the law in the complaint so as to make the accused vicariously liable. for fastening the criminal liability, there is no presumption that every director knows about the transaction. (ii) section 141 does not make all the directors liable for the offence. the criminal liability can be fastened only on those who, at the time of the commission of the offence, were in charge of and were responsible for the conduct of the business of the company. (iii) vicarious liability can be inferred against a company registered or incorporated under the companies act, 1956 only if the requisite statements, which are required to be averred in the complaint/petition, are made so as to make accused therein vicariously liable for offence committed by company along with averments in the petition containing that accused were in-charge of and responsible for the business of the company and by virtue of their position they are liable to be proceeded with. (iv) vicarious liability on the part of a person must be pleaded and proved and not inferred. (v) if accused is managing director or joint managing director then it is not necessary to make specific averment in the complaint and by virtue of their position they are liable to be proceeded with. (vi) if accused is a director or an officer of a company who signed the cheques on behalf of the company then also it is not necessary to make specific averment in complaint. (vii) the person sought to be made liable should be in- charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time. this has to be averred as a fact as there is no deemed liability of a director in such cases. source : recent judgment of the supreme court in the case of national small industries corp. ltd. vs. harmeet singh paintal and anr . right to bail in india when you are arrested, you are taken into custody. this means that you are not free to leave the scene. without being arrested, you can be detained, however, or held for questioning for a short time if a police officer or other person believes you may be involved in a crime. for example, an officer may detain you if you are carrying a large box near a burglary site. you can also be detained by storekeepers if they suspect you have stolen something. whether you are arrested or detained, you do not have to answer any questions except to give your name and address and show some identification if requested. the object of arrest and detention of the accessed person is primarily to secure his appearance at the trial and to ensure that in case he is found guilty he is available to receive the sentence. if his presence at the trial could be reasonable ensured otherwise than by his arrest and detention, it would be unjust and unfair to deprive the accused of his liberty during the pendency of the criminal proceedings against him. the provisions regarding the issue of summons or those relating to the arrest of the accessed person under a warrant or without a warrant or those relating to the release of the accessed at his trial but without unreasonable and unjustifiably interfering with his liberty. thus this article is related with the provisions related with the release of a person on a bail. in words of krishna iyer j. .. the subject of bail:- " ..... belongs to the blurred area of criminal justice system and largely hinges on the hunch of the bench, otherwise called judicial discretion. the code is cryptic on this topic and the court prefers to be tacit, be the order custodial or not. and yet, the issue is one of liberty, justice, public safety and burden of public treasury all of which insist that a developed jurisprudence of bail is integral to a socially sensitised judicial process." thus release on bail is crucial to the accused as the consequences of pre-trial detention are given. if release on bail is denied to the accessed it would mean that though he is presumed to be innocent till the guilt is proved beyond the reasonable doubt he would be subjected to the psychological and physical deprivation of jail life. the jail accessed loses his job and is prevented from contributing effectively to the preparation of his defense. therefore where there are no risks involved in the release of the arrested person it would be cruel and unjust, to deny him bail. the law bails " has to dovetail two conflicting demands namely, on one hand, the requirements of the society for being shielded from the hazards of being exposed to the misadventures of a person alleged to have committed a crime; and on the other, the fundamental canon of criminal jurisprudence. the presumption of innocence of an accused till he is found guilty". in order to sub serve the above said objective, the legislature in its wisdom has given precise directions for granting or granting bail. why bail? before actually determining the place of bail within human rights framework as conferred by the constitution, it is important to examine the object and meaning of bail, such that an analysis of these fundamental objects and change therein may reveal a change. the object detention of an accused person is primarily to secure her/his appearance at the time of trial and is available to receive sentence, in case found guilty. if his/her presence at the trial could be reasonably ensured other than by his arrest or detention, it would be unjust and unfair to deprive the accused of his liberty during pendency of criminal proceedings. thus it is important to note the relevant provisions enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights:- article 9- no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile. article 10- everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him. article 11(1)- everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defense. there are thus several reasons which have been enumerated as to why bail ought to be allowed to prevent pre-trial detention meaning of bail bail, in law, means procurement of release from prison of a person awaiting trial or an appeal, by the deposit of security to ensure his submission at the required time to legal authority. "bail has been defined in the law lexicon as security for the appearance of the accused person on giving which he is released pending trial or investigation." according to black's law dictionary, what is contemplated by bail is to "procure the release of a person from legal custody, by undertaking that he/she shall appear at the time and place designated and submit him/herself to the jurisdiction and judgment of the court.". meaning of bail in india according to criminal procedure code, 1973 (cr.p.c. hereinafter), does not define bail, although the terms bailable offense and non-bailable offense have been defined in section 2(a) cr.p.c. as follows: " bailable offense means an offense which is shown as bailable in the first schedule or which is made bailable by any other law for the time being enforce, and non-bailable offense means any other offense". that schedule refers to all the offenses under the indian penal code and puts them into bailable and on bailable categories. the analysis of the relevant provisions of the schedule would show that the basis of this categorization rests on diverse consideration. however, it can be generally stated that all serious offenses, i.e. offenses punishable with imprisonment for three years or more have seen considered as non bailable offenses. further, sections 436 to 450 set out the provisions for the grant of bail and bonds in criminal cases. the amount of security that is to be paid by the accused to secure his release has not been mentioned in the cr.p.c. thus, it is the discretion of the court to put a monetary cap on the bond. indian courts however ,have greater discretion to grant or deny bail in the case of persons under criminal arrest, e.g., it is usually refused when the accused is charged with homicide. it must be further noted that a person accused of a bailable offenses is arrested or detained without warrant he has a right to be released on bail. but if the offense is non-bailable that does not mean that the person accused of such offense shall not be released on bail: but here in such case bail is not a matter of right, but only a privilege to be granted at the discretion of the court. provisions under the code of criminal procedure, 1973 the code of criminal procedure, 1973, makes provisions for release of accused persons on bail. section 436 of the code provides for release on bail in cases of bailable offenses. section 436 provides that when person not accused of a non-bailable offense is arrested or detained he can be detained as right to claim to be released on bail. the section covers all cases of person s accused of bailable of fences cases of persons though not accused of any offense but against whom security proceedings have been initiated under chapter viii of the code and other cases of arrest and detention which are not in respect of any bailable offense. this section entitles a person other than the accused of a non-bailable offense to be released on bail, it may be recalled that s. 50(2) makes it obligatory for a police officer arresting such a person without a warrant to inform him his right to be released on bail. section 436 (1) of the code signifies that release on bail is a matter of right, or in other words, the officer-in-charge of a police station or any court does not have any discretion whatsoever to deny bail in such cases. the word " appear in this sub- clause is wide enough to include voluntary appearance of the person accused of an offense even where no summons or warrant has been issued against him. there is nothing in s. 436 to exclude voluntary appearance or to suggest that the appearance of the accused must be in the obedience of a process issued by the court. the surrender and the physical presence of the accused with the submission to the jurisdiction and order of the court is judicial custody, and the accused may be granted bail and released from such custody. the right to be released on bail under s. 436(1) cannot be nullified indirectly by fixing too high amount of bond or bail-bond to be furnish by the person seeking bail. section 440(1) provides the amount of every bond executed under this chapter shall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the case, and shall not be excessive. further s. 440(2) empowers the high court or the court of sessions may direct that the bail required by a police officer or magistrate be reduced. sub-section (2) of s. 436 makes a provision to effect that a person who absconds or has broken the condition of his bail bond when released on bail is a bailable case on a previous occasion, shall not as of right to be entitled to bail when brought before the court on any subsequent date even though the offense may be bailable. in maneka gandhi v. union of india [1978] 2 scr 621 the amount of the bond should be determined having regard to these relevant factors and should not be fixed mechanically according to a schedule keyed to the nature of the charge. otherwise, it would be difficult for the accused to secure his release even by executing a personal bond, it would be very harsh and oppressive if he is required to satisfy the court-and what is said in regard to the court must apply equally in relation to the police while granting bail-that he is solvent enough to pay the amount of the bond if he fails to appear at the trial and in consequence the bond is forfeited. the inquiry into the solvency of the accused can become a source of great harassment to him and often resulting denial of bail and deprivation of liberty and should not, therefore, be insisted upon as a condition of acceptance of the personal bond. it also stated that there is a need to provide by an amendment of the penal law that if an accused willfully fails to appear incompliance with the promise contained in his personal bond, he shall be liable to penal action. j. per bhagwati &amp; koshal, jj. further observed that it is now high time that the state government realized its responsibility to the people in the matter of administration of justice and set up more courts for the trial of cases. in moti ram &amp; others. v. state of m.p [1978] 4 scc 47 urgent need for a clear and explicit provision in the code of criminal procedure enabling the release, inappropriate cases, of an under trial prisoner on his bond without sureties and without any monetary obligation. criminal courts today, are extremely unsatisfactory and needs drastic change. in the first place it is virtually impossible to translate risk of non- appearance by the accused into precise monetary terms and even its basic premise that risk of financial loss is necessary to prevent the accused from fleeing is of doubtful validity. there are several considerations which deter an accused from running away from justice and risk of financial loss is only one of them and that too not a major one. in this case the court also pointed out the enlightened bail projects in the united states such as manhattan bail project and d. c. bail project shows that even without monetary bail it has been possible to secure the presence of the accused at the trial in quite a large number of cases. the court laid down following guidelines, that determine whether the accused has his roots in the community which would deter him from fleeing, the court should take into account the following factors concerning the accused: 1. the length of his residence in the community, 2 his employment status, history and his financial condition, 3. his family ties and relationships, 4 his reputation, character and monetary condition, 5.his prior criminal record including any record or prior release on recognizance or on bail, 6. the identity of responsible members of the community who would vouch for his reliability. the nature of the offense charged and the apparent probability of conviction and the likely sentence in so far as these factors are relevant to the risk of non appearance, and if the court is satisfied on a consideration of the relevant factors that the accused has his ties in the community and there is no substantial risk of non-appearance, the accused may, as far as possible, be released on his personal bond. of course, if facts are brought to the notice of the court which go to show that having regard to the condition and background of the accused his previous record and the nature and circumstances of the offense, there may be a substantial risk of his non-appearance at the trial, as for example, where the accused is a notorious bad character or confirmed criminal or the offense is serious (these examples are only by way of illustration), the court may not release the accused on his personal bond and may insist on bail with sureties. but in the majority of cases, considerations like family ties and relationship, roots in the community, employment status etc. may prevail with the court in releasing the accused on his personal bond and particularly in cases where the offense is not grave and the accused is poor or belongs to a weaker section of the community, release on personal bond could, as far as possible, be preferred. but even while releasing the accused on personal bond it is necessary to caution the court that the amount of the bond which it. section 436a . maximum period for which an under trial prisoner can be detained - the new provision section 436awas introduced in order to solve the problems of undertrials' who were languishing in jails as they will now be given an opportunity to be set free instead of endlessly waiting for their trial to take place. this move has been made due to a faulty criminal justice system and provides a makeshift method of providing justice and relief to undertrial prisoners. this seems to suggest that the legislature and the government have accepted the existence of the faulty system and their inability to do anything about it. for this purpose section 436 a was inserted. according to s. 436-a, a person who has undergone detention for a period extending upto half of the maximum period of imprisonment imposed for a particular offense, shall be released on her/his personal bond with or without sureties. the procedure provided is that the court has to hear the public prosecutor and give its decision with reasons in writing. the court may release the applicant, or if not satisfied may order for the continued detention of the applicant. however, no prisoner can be detained for a period longer than the maximum period of imprisonment provided. the exception to the section is that it is not applicable to offenders who have been sentenced to death. moving onto the (de)merits of the provisions itself, s. 436-a gives discretion to the court to set the prisoner free or to make him/her continue imprisonment. there is no mention of any applications having to be filed under the section. the first part of the section states that any prisoner who has served more than half the term of his/her imprisonment 'shall' be released. however, the proviso puts a restriction on the mandatory provision by giving discretionary powers to the courts. this raises questions regarding the implementation of the provision. there is every chance that a prisoner may be sent back to jail to serve a period longer than the half term of his/her sentence. till the judges give their written reasons for the same, one will not know on what grounds a continuation of the term can be ordered as the section does not provide any guidelines. will the undertrial prisoner continue to serve term till the maximum period of the granting of bail with conditions section 437 of the code provides for release on bail in cases of non-bailable offenses. in such cases, bail is not a matter of right. court has sufficient discretion to deny or to grant bail. first schedule to the code provides the list of bailable and non-bailable offenses. further cases often arise under s. 437, where though the court regards the case as fit for the grant of bail, it regards imposition of certain conditions as necessary in the circumstances. to meet this need sub-section (3) of s. 437 provides: when a person accused or suspected of the commission of an offense punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or more or of an offense under chapter vi, chapter xvi or chapter xvii of the indian penal code (45 of 1860) or abatement of, or conspiracy or attempt to commit, any such offense, is released on bail under sub-section (1), the court may impose any condition which the court considers necessary: - (a)in order to ensure that such person shall attend in accordance with the conditions of the bond executed under this chapter, or (b)in order to ensure that such person shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused o

Male: 100%, Male, she’s arguably the hottest star in the music world right now, thanks to her amazing dance beats and wilder than life stage persona, and now, lady gaga brings crustaceans to the limelight... much cooler than the last crustacean-inspired headwear. spotted at the daily mail . over the last few months, there has been much weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth about strategy and tactics over how to communicate with non-scientists, and how to regain public trust over issues like climate change . a good example of this was a recent email exchange between matt nisbet and randy olson . nisbet: when scientists... take action by responding with tit-for-tat attacks on climate skeptics, it... feeds a downward spiral of “war” and conflict rhetoric that appears as just more ideological rancor to the wider public. olson: there comes a point where the public does want to see the science community stand up for themselves. people arguing that scientists are losing to denialists in areas like climate science because they have taken a poor approach to communication are perhaps mischaracterizing the problem. the problem of what approach scientists use to communicate with non-scientists is a real problem, but it is minuscule in these cases. scientists have to, you know, do science in addition to communication with non-scientists. denialists, as far as i can tell, can devote 100% of their time to communication. if scientists want to win, we need to find a way to support a dedicated crew of people whose job is to do nothing else but do public relations. why don’t national academies and organizations for the advancement of science have full-time, professional communicators? the only organization that i can think of that is even close to the sort of “think tank” person who seems to be so routinely called for media interviews is the national center for science education . they do a heroic job, but there’s only sixteen people listed on staff, including some whose job is in no way related to science. allocation of resources is a major problem, and time is a 100% non-renewable resource. people who can devote time to that will, in the short term, win. the good news may be that because scientists are responsible for generating new knowledge, that can help in the long term. ultimately, denialists cannot create anything new. image from here . canadian girl postdoc has a great post about how power relationships filter into conversations in the academic blogosphere. miriam at deep sea news talks about how fact-based science communication is failing. facts are good; a plan is better. flowingdata shows the “ how genetics works ” picture, which should be called, “how genetics was thought to work in the eighteenth century or so.” biochem bell asks if a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . or something. doctor becca then takes this and runs with it some more .

” an excellent question, and one i also struggle with. sheril kirshenbaum asks at the intersection what readers want to know about energy . i’m perpetually confused by nuclear power generation and whether it’s worth it or not. armin schneider, in a book review in plos biology , says neuroscientists must not be interested in the history of their field, because the aren’t a lot of people in the history poster sessions. he neglects to mention that the history posters are displayed all week long, while regular posters are only up for four hours. visits to the history posters are going to be more spread out. nancy duarte wanted feedback on the cover for her next book . it’ll be called resonate , and i guarantee you i’ll be buying it whichever cover ends up on it. yes, it’s about the texas state board of education and the texas k-12 education standards. again. i’ve tried to limit my comments to stuff related to science, particularly biology, because that’s what i feel competent to make comments about. as a faculty member at a university that has about 85% hispanic students, however, i feel obligated to highlight this bit from a new york times article yesterday. it concerns the ongoing review of the state’s social studies standards. efforts by hispanic board members to include more latino figures as role models for the state’s large hispanic population were consistently defeated, prompting one member, mary helen berlanga , to storm out of a meeting late thursday night, saying, “they can just pretend this is a white america and hispanics don’t exist.” ms. berlanga is the representative for the area that includes my institution, by the way. there’s much more of interest in the times piece. last equipment post for a while, but by no means least. finally, something a little bit more high tech than forceps and a microscope . a 60 cycle noise eliminator, the humbug . to understand how marvelous this little box is, i have to explain a little about electrophysiology. everything you’re using to read this blog post runs off a powerline. so do lights and other electrical appliances. those electric powerlines generate noise, or a “ hum ,” that cycles 60 times a second in north american, and 50 times a second in australia and, i think, the u.k. this “60 cycle” is picked up by recording electrodes, like those used to record neural activity. since biologists are interested in the biology and not power mains, the 60 cycle just gets in the way of seeing the actual biological signal. so eletrophysiologists have to spend huge amounts of time trying to eliminate that 60 cycle noise by grounding, using faraday cages, tinfoil, alligator clamps, and offerings to minor deities. worse, it’s incredibly unpredictable. a set-up that is perfect one day may have horrible 60 cycle the next day. thus, anything that helps combat 60 cycle is a beautiful thing. and that is what this clever little device does. i had no idea it existed until i went to the annual neuroscience meeting the year i was hired, and discovering it alone made the trip worthwhile. i had never met carin bondar until i followed her on twitter . only after that did i learn that we have several colleagues in common, so there is absolutely no “old boy’s club” networking behind her decision to put me in nerd corner this week. nerd corner? it’s like a regular corner, only, you know, nerdier. actually, carin thought i might be interesting enough to interview. i sure fooled her. carin has a great website , with lots of other interviews, career resources, and more. tell her zen sent ya! p.s. – she’s not related to canadian astronaut roberta bondar . continuing this week with some of my favourite things in the lab... like my first selection, this is something that is basic but absolutely fundamental. a good stereo dissecting microscope, with a mount for a camera. edward tufte often argues that much of science is the story of increasing resolving power. the classic example was the telescope, which was celebrated in the last year’s 400 th anniversary celebration of galileo using the device for such great effect. microscopes came slightly later, but also revolutionized thinking about the world. when i bought this microscope, i bought a camera lucida for drawing pictures, something i’d use through much of doctoral and post-doctoral work. a good drawing could provide more information more efficiently than using 35 mm film then. i have rarely used it, since digital photography had made it faster and more efficient to take a lot of photographs and work with those. last month, i complained about the common misconception that tenure was “a job for life.” florida state university has just provided an example of why it’s a misconception. twenty-five examples, in fact. my sympathy to those losing their positions. the prospect of losing a job is always terrifying. 
Male: 100%, Female,  next week, i will be leaving my position with boeing and trek to boston to work for the mit lincoln laboratory in lexington, ma. earlier today i read my very first blog post and how i felt my first week here at kennedy space center has not changed to this day. i will definitely miss everyone i've worked with, the awesome launches , and the space program! however, this does not mean i am giving up on my dream in becoming an astronaut. the blog will continue! :) i still plan on being very active in the community, stay a space advocate, and work towards a phd. right now, the direction of our space program is a little up in the air, but i know we'll get back on track. i'm also excited that i found a nearby judo club i am going to join so i can continue the sport. this endeavor will be exciting and i will be supporting the engineering analysis group on various projects. next week is my last week, but i will definitely be blogging during the move process! thanks to all for the support up to this point. it really means a lot to me!! while attempting to load propellant friday night, a leak was detected in discovery's rcs (reaction control system) helium isolation value – on the right-hand oms (orbital maneuvering system) fuel system. further testing and troubleshooting steps are being planned at the launch pad to examine two helium system regulators, which maintain pressure to the fuel tank and are further down the plumbing from the isolation valves. if the regulators are functioning correctly, which will be tested later this week when the necessary equipment is ready, engineers could determine discovery can safely fly 'as-is' despite the isolation valve problem. if a repair or replacement to the valve is required, we would not be able to access it out at the pad...which means...rolling the shuttle back to the vehicle assembly building, demating discovery from its external fuel tank and solid rocket boosters, then towing discovery to the orbiter processing facility....and removing the oms pod. even with the planned testing, the april 5 launch date still stands. it's what comes out of these test results that will determine if we need to roll back the shuttle which would cause a delay. spacex successfully fired the falcon 9 rocket's nine merlin engines for 3.5 seconds, completing a key preflight test before the privately-developed booster is cleared for launch in april. ground test was one of the final steps before launch of the falcon 9 , which is scheduled for no earlier than april 12. the static fire verified all of the launch pad's ground systems are ready to support the mission. between now and launch, engineers will install the rocket's flight termination system charges that would destroy the vehicle if it flew off course and threatened the public. nasa awarded spacex a $1.6 billion contract to fly 12 operational falcon 9 and dragon missions to the international space station beginning in 2011. spacex plans a flight of the dragon in july, followed by a rendezvous demonstration with the space station in november. but those schedules hinge on a timely and successful falcon 9 test flight in april. "imax: hubble 3d" debuts at the air and space museum...we give it the "red carpet" treatment - checking out the movie, checking in with the astronaut stars, listening to the star who voiced it over - leonardo dicaprio, and weighing in with the director and the nasa brass about the wow-factor of the imax experience. also: a falcon 9 "hot fire" disappoints, the shuttle program manager says "no problem" for shuttle to keep flying, and safely -- it's only a question of money -- and obama gets ready to speak up for his controversial new plan for nasa...and braces for what promises to be a firestorm of protest at planned april 15 conference on the future of america's space program. discovery is currently at launch pad 39a. launch of sts-131 is targeted for april 5, 2010 at 6:27 a.m. this past week, the sts-131 astronaut crew went through a mock countdown/dress rehearsal to prepare themselves for their actual launch date operations. the external tank that will be used for sts-132 (shuttle atlantis - targeted launch on may 14, 2010) arrived last week and was transferred to the vehicle assembly building. you may have heard some talk effecting endeavour's planned july launch. an issue related to the alpha magnetic spectrometer-02 payload testing is threatening a delay to sts-134’s slot in the manifest, to the point it may slip behind sts-133, or even as far as 2011 in a worst case scenario. however, no decision will be made on the schedule until after additional testing results and the launch of sts-131 in april. read more.. here . the next step in ground testing spacex's falcon 9 rocket will be a hotfire of the first stage engines. the launch team will ignite the nine merlin 1c engines for three-and-a-half seconds during the test. hot fire is targeted for late morning or early afternoon, tomorrow. lift-off of the rocket could occur late this month, but more likely early april. florida's space coast braces for layoffs, buzz aldrin muses on the next steps for nasa and his upcoming stint on "dancing with the stars," plus other headlines from this week in space. yesterday i attended the space coast's society of women engineers awards banquet. i was nominated for the distinguish new woman engineer award. we had guest speaker dr. cammy r. abernathy (dean, college of engineering of university of florida and professor of materials science and engineering) who gave a great insight about the economic shift in society that has effected the engineering disciplines within universities and industry. i was selected to receive the award in the category i was nominated for. it was a great honor accepting this award last night and being surrounded by so many women who embrace leadership and give back to their community. i have had great support and encouragement from my mentors who have helped shape me professionally throughout my career. one thing i have learned for sure is that you can never have too many mentors. i learn a variety of qualities from the different people i look up to. the ceremony was fantastic and i was amazed in the technical leadership of all the nominees. below are the names of all the honorees that were recognized last night. nominees for space coast distinguished new woman engineer of the year mrs. susie allen-sierpinski ms. arianna aron ms. jessica beahn lt. sofia calica ms. patricia del rio mrs. megan jaunich ms. brigette linville-padgett ms. melissa mierzwa ms. erin mulholland mrs. rye myers ms. tzvetelina petrova ms. tamalyn resnick ms. amanda sandberg ms. damaris sarria - recipient ms. nicole titus ms. jessica towslee ms. sarah walden nominees for space coast technical achievement award capt. shana figueroa ms. helen garcia ms. catherine kammerer - recipient ms. barbara kerschner ms. catheryn logan ms. teresa sauter mrs. carlyn smith mrs. marcella solomon nominees for space coast outstanding woman engineer of the year award ms. beta alfonso capt. meredith beg ms. maria groh-hammond mrs. kimberly guodace mrs. janice jingle ms. catherine kammerer ms. barbara kerschner ms. kathy mclaughlin mrs. elaine seiler mrs. consuela smith - recipient ms. nancy szpara ms. denise thaller

Male: 100%, Female, i want another baby. i really do. yassine-not so much.but he may not have to worry-at least not if martin kramer has his way. the current fellow at harvard’s weatherhead center for international affairs has suggested i -and other palestinian women from gaza- should deliberately be stopped from having babies because chances are, they will be grow up to be radicals.according to the electronic intifada, who first broke the story last week, kramer offered this fasinating piece of solicited advice in the annual herzliyah conference in israel earlier this month in which he called on “the west” to take measures to limit the births of muslim palestinians of gaza and consider them a form of terrorism, or, as kramer puts it, “extreme demographic armament”. he also praised the unconscionable israeli siege for getting the ball rolling already and reducing the numbers of palestinian babies there (see: infanticide; gaza diet). if your skin didn’t curl watching the audience clap at the end of that video, well, save your soul somehow.family planning, the martin kramer way kramer’s argument: gaza is a cauldron of crazy;

blow me away. i have blogged about her carved crayons in the past , but recently she tackled the 12 signs of the chinese zodiac which are now on exhibit at the packer schopf gallery in chicago along with many of her ceramic works in a show named sojourn. first, the 12 symbols of the chinese zodiac: now, diem chau's zodiac crayons: she began with the monkey on the far right (note how she wrote on

to watch and there's certainly a lot of wonderful talent out there. take a look. above background photo by yang yi below is the article by conor risch for pdn, followed by images from each of the 30 photographers and links to their personal sites. look at the photographers in this year’s pdn’s 30 class and you’ll find a solid refutation of the idea that “everyone is a photographer now.” did “everyone” move to beijing to freelance for the ap with no financial guarantee like danfung dennis? or live out of a mini-van so they could create a major project like scott conarroe? or defy social norms to become one of the only female photojournalists from gaza like eman mohammed? is “everyone” willing to be as patient as alex prager, who put on her own shows when gallerists ignored her? does “everyone” have 2,250 followers on flickr like ben roberts? perseverance and determination are common to all these photographers but equally notable is the individuality of their interests and styles. these photographers have produced long-term projects on music scenes (lauren dukoff), orthodox hasidic communities (clémence de limburg), and a mother’s paranoid schizophrenia (sohrab hura). they have used the visual language of gritty reportage to shoot cookbooks (gabriel stabile) and created photojournalism based on “a sense of feeling” (andy spyra). they have used modern image-making techniques to lament the destruction of a centuries-old city (yang yi). they tell stories that matter to them in ways that make them matter to viewers. yes, it’s true: a lot more people are taking pictures now than when pdn was founded 30 years ago. but only a very small percentage of those people are photographers. we salute these 30 individuals, who are helping to define what being a photographer means today. —conor risch click on each artist's name below (shown in alphabetical order) to visit their website or portfolio. levi brown: alejandro cartagena: scott conarroe: sumit dayal: clemence de

chocolate bars from scratch. above: three examples of possible options for your own created chocolate bars chocri is a german startup, founded in september 2008, but launched in the us in january 2010. what they do is we allow you to customize your own chocolate bar right on their website. you start with an organic belgian chocolate base of milk, white or dark chocolate and then choose from a selection of over 100 of gourmet, organic and exotic ingredients (fruit, grains, nuts, spices, confections and decor). if you don't know anything about ingredients, they also offer many recommended combinations and options to make the selection simple. once you've chosen or built your bar, you can name it (they print the name and the ingredients on the package), and then they hand-make the bars in germany and ship them off to you. from bacon to blueberries, pretzels to pecans, you can be as adventurous or as safe as you'd like. i made three to test them out (shown below). one was dark chocolate with real orange bits and orange chocolate drops, another was milk chocolate, pecans and toffee and the third was milk chocolate with organic salted pretzels and caramel chocolate drops. and yes, they are, er.... were, delicious. so, how do you do it? you start with your choice of milk, white or dark chocolate as the base: then you are walked through the process to choose as many or as few additives as you wish from the following options (click on each image below to enlarge): choose your fruit: your spices: your nuts: your confections: your decor: your grains: there's no minimum. you can choose to make one bar or one hundred bars. once you've selected your ingredients for your chocolate bar(s), they print the name you choose and the ingredients on the individual package, then ship them right to your door. they use only the best ingredients, such as organic, fair trade chocolate from belgium. making them even more delicious is the fact that they also donate a percentage of otheir revenues to div kinder, an organization that supports children at the ivory coast, and you are free to add your own donation at checkout. above: the chocri team what are you waiting for? with easter and mother's day right around the corner, these would make awesome gifts. get started here. if you like chocolate, you'll love this: the art of chocolate. oops, reverse that.

magazine is light on editorial and heavy on nude models. for their third issue, they featured 8 different covers of nude supermodels lara stone, jeneil williams, amber valletta, naomi campbell,

quickly sold out. all profits from the gap love tee shirts went to support haiti. the one exception was kate moss' tee, whose profits went to great ormond street, a uk children's charity. all 8 covers

"naaaah." but others may claw their way to this new social networking site that capitalizes on the growing trend of older women dating (seducing?) younger men. the brains behind the concept, shelli netko, the founder and president of cougars &amp; co. says: "my main goal in starting cougars &amp; co. was to create an environment where women could learn to love the life they live and live the life the love. after all, age is just a number. recent surveys show 34% of women in their 40s date men who are younger and 17% of women in their 50s do the same. this isn't just a trend, it's a new social norm that both women and men are obviously embracing. women are gravitating to younger men because they seem to have more of an energetic spirit that matches theirs. women are taking better care of themselves, as a result, 40 is the new 30; 50 is the new 40. so the age difference becomes a non-issue. you don't have to be a hollywood star to go out with someone 10 or 15 years your junior, but god bless demi moore for bringing it into the spot light!" above: the world's most well-known cougar and cub; stunning actress demi moore and her hottie husband, ashton kutcher. the press release:

cub in you who needs a little “me” time – think r&amp;r with a little bit of “bam!” “the cougar and cub culture is a growing trend that is less concerned with age and focused on reinventing yourself at any age,” netko said. “while we plan to go nationwide with our charity bachelor auctions, we thought scottsdale was the perfect place to introduce the cougars &amp; co. concept and begin our social network.” the site , which is now live, is offering an introductory $1 membership to those that join during the first month. after april 30, the monthly membership fee is $9.95. members can join the hunt by creating a profile, joining groups, creating their own groups and initiating online connections. for members looking to get out, monthly happy hour events will be held and year-round getaway vacations for cougars and cubs will be organized. the charity bachelor auction as part of the company kick-off, cougars &amp; co. is holding a charity bachelor auction on thursday, april 1st in scottsdale, az. valley cougars will be pleased to see there's much more on the men-u than chips and dip when as many as 10 cubs (including a past contender for the bachelorette) strut their stuff all

yesterday at the petit palais in paris, only two years after his death in 2008. the impressive retrospective covers 15 chapters of his career, its critical acclaim and occasional failures, including his 1971 forties-inspired "scandal collection", which was pummeled by critics at the time. above photos © fondation pierre bergé - yves saint laurent the exhibit begins with his early work for christian dior and continues through to his last final collection, in 2002. in total, there are 307 pieces of couture and ready-to-wear fashions accompanied by films, artwork and photos. above: yves saint laurent in his dior studio above: yves saint laurent in his own studio, 1986 designs for catherine deneuve in the 1967 movie belle de jour , lauren bacall, and the duchess of windsor are included as well as creations that were inspired by art, far away places (he is said to have used his imagination and preferred that to travel) and the glamour of hollywood. okay, so it's not as impressive as the actual show, but here's a little retrospective i put together for you (in case you can't get to the petit palais) of many of the key pieces from his numerous and varied collections,

Male: 100%, Male, on 5 september history was made by 7 ministers of health from low-income countries together with serious politicians from west europe and representatives from aid organisations that had learnt their lessons . the group launched the international health partnership. http://www.dfid.gov.uk/news/files/ihp/default.asp if aid from rich countries should effectively improve health of the poor, they said, the aid must be: 1. coordinated, 2. foucsed on improving health systems as a whole instead of one disease at a time, 3. and part of good national plans. these statements are evidance based, much needed but "un-sexy". so let me translate the 3 statements into blunt words: 1. it is mad that ministries of health in low-income countries each week must meet a growing number of aid delegations. 2. it is cruel to tell millions of poor mothers; "your child is dying from pneumonia for which our clinic have no drugs because bush, blair and rich activits did not know that pneumonia and diarrhea kill as many as do malaria, tb and hiv. 3. it is stupid to fund seprate clinics for each disease when there is not even staff and money e nough for one clinic in each village. so, 5 september 2007, is a happy day for global health. fragmented health aid based on what is "sexy" in the media of the rish will be replaced by health aid focusing on what is needed in the clinic of the poor. why is sweden not yet part of the international health partnership? the swedish minister for development aid recently wisely focused swedish bilateral aid too fewer countries. so hopefully she will soon join the partnership of the wise. in these issues it seems more important if politicians are wise than if they come from left or right, so we can hope that sweden will join. this vlog uses a flash presentation that gapminder did with trendalyzer graphics. it shows the development of sweden during the last 300 years. it is my first attempt to use chroma key video with animated statistics as done daily with weather forcasts in tv. following my talk in swedish radio news on how to avaoid child deaths in pneumonia i get requests on where to donate. what is needed is steady funding over many year so that poor families get access to diagnosis and antibiotics. i judge that unicef is most competent to provide long-term support for child survival. the reason is good track record, that the present director ann veneman understands how health service system in low income countries need long term support and that unicef base their policy on best available research. to save children now donate to http://www.unicef.se/stod_oss/ge_en_gava_har/ if not in sweden look up unicef in your country. to support research for better care for infections of the poor donate to world infections fund http://www.vif.se/mallar/donatewwallit.aspx?sidid=10186 . keep donating regularly to a good cause, and learn about progress and challanges. the underfunded needs are the continious majora challanges for poor families; pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea, education and the daily bread, i.e. agriculture in rula areas and job in urban areas. water and sanitation also get less attention than emergency relief and hiv; the two worthy causes that presently receives almost sufficient funding. cotton farmers in texas earn their wealth from soviet-like government subsidies. the annual 4 billion us dollar tax subsides to 25 000 us cotton farmers are of concern for global health! the reason being that this obstacle to free trade kill so many children. 1. subsidies hamper economic growth in cotton producing west african countries. this keeps millions of hardworking farmers in poverty and hinder them to care well for their children. http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/trade/bp30_cotton.htm 2. if only parts of the 4 tax billions were re-directed tovann venneman at unicef, she can avoid 600,000 child deaths from pneumonia by using 0.6 billion usd to provide care and antibiotics. http://www.unicef.org/childsurvival/index_35937.html 3. the soviet cotton economy of texas is a major obstacle for successful agreements on free world trade. and a fair global trade system will save thelives of so many children’s . http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl57_e.htm the world is waiting for a us president with the guts to implement a cotton perestroika in texas! on january 27 at the world economic forum in davos i asked bill gates for help. help to speed up provision of courses on global health at universities around the world. i gave him a copy of our textbook on global health (see below). he rightly noted that it was the first of its kind and that fact based overviews of the global health situations are badly needed. on february 7 i got this note from our publisher studentlitteratur: "här kommer lite glada nyheter om global health. dessutom har bill & melinda gates foundation köpt 200 ex som deras personal ska läsa!" gates foundation had bought 200 copies, one each for the staff! is it possible to write a book on the health of all 6.5 billion persons living on the globe? well we did it and now it is on sale from monday 27/11 2006. we are six authors, but it was ann lindstrand who got it together and birgitta rubensson that brought it to print. hundreds of students read and commented various versions. http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_b/203-2244500-9311121?url=search-alias%3dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=rosling we wrote it for those that in a short text want to learn: -how the health of the world's population has changed over time; -how the main determinants of health varied with time and place; -how health can be measured; about the causes of the main diseases in the world; -what health care that exist around the world. our book is a summary of the works by greater scholars on global health. the pros with our book are the overviews; the cons are the simplifications and errors that are a consequence of our broad ambitions. yesterday unaids declared: " the global aids epidemic continuous to grow... an estimated 40 millions are living with hiv... the number with hiv has increased from 37 millions in 2004. www.unaids.org but on the aids day in 2004 the message from unaids was that "over 41 million people are living with hiv/aids" http://www.un.org/events/aids/2004/ are unaids lying? no, it is led by honest and good scientists, so how come? if you dig further into the data you find that the uncertainty range of unaids estimates are wide: - somewhere between 32 to 44 millions lived with hiv in 2004 and today somewhere between 34 to 47 millions. so the true number may be slowly falling. a reasonable conclusion is that the number of hiv infected in the world remains the same over the last years. but telling that may put funding for much needed hiv/aids control at risk, so its better to conclude that the epidemic continuous to grow. unaids may be excused for drawing the scary conclusion that the epidemic is still increasing, because they simultaneously communicate that there are solid evidence that the epidemic is decreasing in more and more countries. the exclusive focus on treatment may have delayed the decrease. best available assessment indicate that money is best used on scaling up prevention http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5766/1474 but international support to prevention tends to focus on the moral of the donor rather than the effectiveness of the action. the present us administration likes to fund "less sex" and sweden likes to fund "more condoms". evidence from zimbabwe tells that both works. later sex debut and fewer partners may even be more important than more condom use http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5761/664 
Female: 100%, Female,  for those of you joining us for the first time, please go back and start reading from the beginning (back in august 2005). otherwise, the blog may not make much sense to you. 2009 update: this blog authors are using the assistance of landolt &amp; associates in fort worth, texas, for advice on this blog. please contact them if you have any questions or inquiries: contact@landoltlawoffice.com hi, this is traci, the blog administrator... the twins are trying to decide what should be posted here and what shouldn't. i apologize for the delay. i was reading back over the posts and some of the emails, and some of them are really interesting about twins switching places. i thought maybe we could open up a discussion about that while we wait... if you are a twin or know a twin who has switched places, please email your stories to me. we'll try to put together a posting with everyone's comments, so be sure to indicate if it's okay to post it on the blog. you are also welcome to send in your impression of identical twins overall...and how this blog has or hasn't changed your view of twins. and, of course, if you do send in your comment or email, we will send you a totally imaginary twinkie experiment t-shirt! thanks to all you loyal twinkie fans out there! time to go buy a box and eat some while we're waiting. traci email inquiries: contact@landoltlawoffice.com happy new year, ya'll!! while ashley has been portraying me down here at the coast, i was up north living in her condo. yes, while she was on the beach and enjoying the ocean, i was "enjoying" the lovely white fluffy stuff. i took this picture of the view behind ashley's condo. talk about a contrast to the view outside my house! sorry about the delay in the blog posts. ashley and i have been having "creative differences" about this blog. to make a long story short, ashley read my comment about her and tarkington and said: i can't believe you told them that! the way i see it, professor tarkington is my professor. mine. what happens at the law school is my business because these people think that was me doing all that stuff. so why can't i talk about it? ashley really loves all of you out there and appreciates your support. i understand that, and i think that's great. but, it doesn't mean that you should have the details glossed over or sugar-coated. i'll try to give you hints about tarkington when i can--until i can figure out a way to give you the whole story... how embarrassing that ashley and i are having a fight on the world's stage. this has to be my mom's worst nightmare... back to what happened to me... as one of the commentors pointed out (and made me laugh), the twinkie experiment wasn't exactly fair--at least at the beginning, because ashley got a nude beach, and what did i get? altitude sickness! overall, i have to admit, i probably did have an easier time with the whole school thing. dr. lyle was in on the twin switch, so i didn't have to go into an academic program alone. i can't imagine for my life walking into a law school program like ashley did. i feel bad about laughing, but i can't help it. she probably was able to do it because she has this mentality that she can handle anything. i don't think she knows even now what a lion's den she was walking into. i had the opposite problem. instead of walking into a room full of law students who practically pee around the room to mark their territory, i had the "huggers." you know who i'm talking about. those people who have to hug you like they haven't seen you in years, and you are a long-lost dear friend. i'm not a big touchy-feely type person, unless it's a really hot guy who's doing the touching and feeling (haha). it's probably inherent to the whole psychology thing to have them be so tactile. probably something freudian. as i mentioned in an earlier post, the party dr. lyle had at the start of the semester was especially humorous because ashley didn't give me a physical description of robert. (she told me she didn't think i'd run into him.) so the problem ended up being: how do you stay away from someone when you don't know what they look like? one of these days, i'm going to ask robert if i actually spoke to him at the party before i knew who he was... have i mentioned that dr. lyle's husband is hot? he is. totally. of course, he's a little old and married, but i thought he was really nice looking in a kevin costner kind of way. (man, i might as well delete this paragraph now, because i'm sure ashley will have a fit that i said that!) he was also really sweet and funny. he walked around helping the caterers and stuff at the party, and every time he'd see me, he'd say, "so, are you caught yet?" dr. lyle's husband is a psychologist, too. can you imagine what their kids must be like???? the first day of school was pretty anxiety-driven. the lack of humidity in the air made my hair have more body ---something i'm definitely not used to since i've been living at the beach. we're talking flat-head city. i have a flippy haircut that is (i think) darling, and the multi-layers and flips make it look not so flat in the humidity. but when you take me from a place with 95 percent humidity and drop me into a place with 18 percent humidity, well, you can imagine what happened. the flippiness with a small "f" turned into flippiness with a big fat "f". and ashley is not a flippy kind of person. she warned me the people up north may not take kindly to a flippy haircut on her. i tried to get rid of it. believe me, i tried. i used water on it after it was dry. i used hair spray. i curled it under.... but when i arrived on that huge campus and walked through the wind up hill (both ways), the hair took on a life of its own. and it decided to be flippy. and i think i told you last time, that when i ran into paige, ashley's best friend (who i've met a few times when i've visited ashley in the past) the very first thing out of her mouth was what is the deal with your hair??? not "hi, how are you," or "how was your summer", but a rude announcement that might as well have said, "hey! everyone! look over here at this ugly hair!" it's no secret that i am not a big fan of paige. as this blog goes on, i think you'll understand why. the hair thing started it, though. so much for integrating quietly into the crowd. everyone had to notice me and my hair. which only brought on more hugging, since that's what psych students do. what a big difference class was compared to law school. the psych seminar actually had donuts and coffee for the students! and the first day was spent going around the room introducing ourselves. students actually talked amongst themselves while dr. lyle was talking. and she didn't kill them. not to mention how nice everyone was to each other. we also didn't have to read for the first day, which was weird. some people didn't even have their textbooks yet. i was in shock. the most fun on the first day was finally seeing who the notorious robert was. he wasn't anything like i had imagined him from ashley's comments. and i don't remember seeing him at dr. lyle's party. he's tall -- almost 6 feet, slim, but not skinny or fat. dresses pretty nice. dark hair and dark warm eyes with wire-rim glasses. i usually don't like guys with glasses, but he was an exception. okay, i admit it, i thought robert was cute from the very first day. but it's not like i hit on him or anything. i intended to keep my distance and not even speak to him. he sat in the row in front of us, and paige leaned over to me and said, "i guess he wants to make sure you've seen him." and in typical paige-fashion, she said it loudly enough for him to hear. the girl sitting on the other side of me, who i called "the screamer" for awhile since i didn't know her name, of course had to say hi to robert. she was like leaning forward with her desk (they are the individual desks, not like the rows of tables in law school), in front of me to ask robert how his summer was. when he turned around, he just kind of looked at me for a second and then said, "fine." real big conversationalist. the first day of class left me with one major question: what the hell happened to psychology?? i took a few courses in college, and i've read stuff through the years. but somehow, they changed it. it's no longer the common sense intuitive, get in touch with your inner-child's feelings, bring memories to the surface, bells ringing, dogs salivating, penis envying, human behavior study that i thought it was. dr. lyle gave an overview lecture about the topics we would be covering in the course, and i was really amazed. it's now a complicated mixture of theories, statistics, philosophies, medicine, and science. i guess it was pretty arrogant of me to walk in there thinking i was up to par with the other students. boy, did i learn that lesson the hard way... here's a picture of what christmas time looks like on the coast. ashley took this picture from the upper deck of the ferry on her way back home from law school on her last day as "amy." this is traci, the blog administrator, and i have a message for you from the whole gang. apparently, almost everyone (except the professors?) knows about this blog now. ( talk about pressure...;)) we wish you,your family, and friends...a very merry christmas &amp; happy new year!! from ashley &amp; amy traci drs. miriam and william lyle joyce (mom) martin (dad) robert peevy paige fowler charlie and his flock: rose ricky haylie giny billy emma lee duane libby sammy regan &amp; booger welcome to the real-life twinkie experiment part two! i'm amy morrighan, and my twin sister's name is ashley--who most of you already know. just a brief background in case you are just joining us... ashley and i are twenty-seven year old identical twins. ashley is in her third year of graduate school, working towards her doctorate in psychology. her emphasis is on twin studies at the university of ______. (i still can't put the name of her school.) she lives up north where it snows more than i would like, but otherwise it's beautiful. ashley's best friend is named paige. ashley used to like a guy named robert until the great ac/dc concert incident last summer. robert and paige are also psych doctoral students. although paige is more into abnorrmal psychology...which is understandable if you've ever met her. sorry, that was petty. bad amy, bad. while ashley is in grad school, i am in my second year (a "2l") in law school. i can't give my exact location, but i can tell you i live on the coast. my interest in law has primarily been in the area of intellectual property. but i also am interested in other areas which span across the board. they say the first year of law school is the worst, and mine was no exception. in fact, i can honestly say, last year was the worst year i've ever had. the coursework itself is challenging, but not as hard as they make it out to be. it wasn't the work itself i found challenging since i actually like studying the law. the people in my life you've probably heard the most about are my professors for this past semester who ashley encountered: professor rogerson, professor tarkington, and professor mathews. my two closest friends (or at least they were up until the twin switch) are vicki and beth. i am probably closest to my next-door neighbor, charlie, who has taken in a whole lot of his kids and grandkids to live with him. he basically has a big ol' heart and loves to feed and take care of people. and dogs. he has a beach house right next to mine, and actually owns mine too, though he rents it out to me. ashley and i are the only kids in our family. our parents live in (can i say where they live? no? okay.) they live in a place that's cold, too. we have great parents who support us financially (and emotionally) while we are in school. neither of our parents were supposed to know about the twin switch, but that changed when ashley told mom. more details about that later. we ultimately decided to do the twin switch for several reasons... 1. everyone always asks us if we ever switch places, and we wanted to see if we could pull it off now that we're adults. 2. ashley is working on her dissertation involving twins, and she wanted to see if her advisor would let her incorporate the data from the switch somehow. her advisor, dr. lyle, said she would review ashley's and my data at the end of the switch to see if there was anything workable for the dissertation. i am sure ashley will give you the scoop on that. 3. as mentioned above, i had a hard time with law school, and was about to give up on it, and i wanted to see if there was anything ashley could do while she was there as me. of course, i didn't -exactly- tell ashley how bad things were or how much i was relying on her for help... but that's because i didn't know how things would be for her. and she told me over and over not to say anything that would alter her behavior during the twin switch. ashley and i also started off trying to think of a bet... i would bet we could pull off the switch (because i always knew we could), and ashley would bet we couldn't. unfortunately, we couldn't ever agree on what we would put for the wager. looking back on it, i guess we could have used robert...(just kidding) the whole thing seemed pretty funny at first, and we both had our doubts as to if we would actually even give it a try. then ashley flew down to visit me, and we started getting our hair and nails done to match each other. i thought ashley was going to catch the first flight out when i gave her a tour of the law school, showed her where everything was, where to sit, etc. i think that's when reality set in for her. i had no idea how freaked out she was until after the switch was over and she admitted what she did the weekend right before school started... ashley told me i shouldn't mention anything about it, but i'll see if i can put the details in. let's just say, ashley didn't tell you everything she did during the switch. i think many of you would be surprised and amused if you heard it all. as for me, you haven't heard everything that i went through, either. ash and i have agreed to keep this rated g or pg since we have no idea how old our readers are. sorry, that means no graphic details about what went on between ashley and professor tarkington (can i mention that, ashley? no? okay.) you didn't hear that from me... i left for ashley's condo up north on the weekend right before school started. leaving the ocean was a lot harder than i thought it would be. i really felt a loss for some reason, and it wasn't until much later that i figured out why (with robert's and ashley's help). it felt like i was leaving my swingset or something. when we were little, ashley and i had the coolest swingset in our back yard, with the monkeybars along the top, with a swing, the rings, glider, etc. it was awesome. then, my dad took a job in another state, and we had to move. without the swingset. ash and i were mortified and actually grieved for our swingset. anyway, that's the same grief i felt when i left the coast, and it was haunting for me. i couldn't understand it because i figured the twin switch wouldn't last that long, and i could go back anytime i wanted thanks to frequent flier miles. when the switch ended, and ashley and i were able to sit down and go over everything, it was then ashley told me what she had discovered regarding identity issues for twins during our twin switch. it feels like you are leaving yourself behind when you switch places with your twin. anything that is not exactly like your twin, you have to cut off. completely. otherwise people who knew ashley would never believe i was her. it's not just leaving my "life" that was hard... it was leaving me...all the things about me that i like (fish, crabs, etc), and having to mentally train myself to like what ashley likes or ashley does. mentally, it has more of an effect on you that you might think. i could never have anticipated how much it would effect me. so, i arrive up north, and (i hope i can tell you this part) i had altitude sickness for awhile because her condo is near the mountains. going from sea-level to the mountains took some getting used to. i had migraine-like headaches for awhile. other than that, escaping the 98 degree temperatures and 95% humidity was fabulous!! my hair just seemed to come alive for some reason. this, of course, meant i had to deal with the flippiness of my haircut. i have a medium length shorter-cut which is cut to flip in the back. ashley said "no way" would paige or anyone believe she would ever have a flippy cut. it was a constant battle between me and my hair there for awhile. and on my first day of class, the first words out of paige's mouth when she saw me was: "what is up with your hair?" i met with dr. lyle the saturday before school started. ashley thinks this woman is so great, but to be honest, she didn't make that great of a first impression on me. she came across very "snooty" almost--not very friendly to me at all. ash says it's because she's from the north and "that's how some northerners are," but i don't buy it. everyone else was really nice. i also think dr. lyle had her own agenda with the twin switch. there were times when i definitely thought she purposely set me up to fail so she could see if anyone could tell i wasn't really ashley. dr. lyle had a student reception at her house that night, which gave me a chance to be around the psych people before classes started. of course, ashley didn't describe robert for me, so i didn't know what he looked like. she told me just to ignore him anyway, since i was supposed to be her. ashley was mad at robert because he never called her after their one date they had (that ended in disaster). so the plan was for me to just stay away from him. i don't think ashley realized that robert was signed up to be in the same seminar as i was. it was just a matter of time before i ran into him. at dr. lyle's party, however, i tried to avoid him. but how do you avoid someone when you don't know what that person looks like??? there was a girl at the party named jamie who walked over to me first thing and wanted to know how my "date with robert" went. i told her i didn't want to talk about it, and she said, "oh, that's because he's here, isn't he?" i almost freaked out right then because for all i knew, i had already been talking to him and been sickly-sweet and nice, like i was trying to be to everyone i encountered. later during the party, jamie came up to me again to let me know she saw robert in the livingroom. i tried to sneak a peek at the guys in the livingroom to see if i could guess which guy my sister would like. i didn't have robert pegged right, though. i still can't remember if i actually talked to him or not before i knew who he was. if i did, i'm sure he thought it was weird, because on monday, when i really did find out who he was, i intentionally stayed away from him. well, i wanted to give ya'll some background on me and to kind of let you know where things started. this has been just some general comments, and next i'll try to get into the details more. hi everybody~! i took this picture right out in front of charlie's and amy's beach houses. it's my favorite time of day--sunset. i apologize for not posting sooner. things have been pretty hectic, as you can probably imagine. thanks to everyone for your kind emails to traci that she forwarded to me. it has meant a great deal. as i think traci posted already, amy would like to have a chance to give her side of the "story." she read my blog postings, which is okay, since i was trying to get her to switch back and told her where the site was so she could know what's been going on in her life. she isn't actually mad or anything; she just wants people to see how things were for her before they judge her. i told her no one is judging anybody. life is life, and we're all human. let he who is without sin cast the first stone, so to speak. i hope you all will enjoy amy's side of things. she was going to post her own blog all along, but she wasn't sure who she could trust to get things out there without getting caught. we had some close calls, and given her background at the law school, she had to be extra extra careful. she did keep a journal though with entries, so she can make postings rather than throw it all out there all at once. i'm not sure what format she is going to use, though. i think it also depends on traci. i suspect it will be a little at a time. i told amy she should try and publish the information in a book somehow since the information is already writen, instead of re-writing it as a blog. plus, there are some details both of us experienced that we didn't (and still don't) feel comfortable putting on the computer (i think you guys might like to hear some of that stuff as well--cough, cough). so this will give amy a chance to give you a preview of what a book might say--only the rated g (pg?) blog version. i know from my experience that it's really easy to form opinions about someone by watching someone else living their life. so, all i ask is that you not be too hard on me (or her) as you hear what amy has been up to in my life. :o) thanks again for your friendship and support during the past months. god bless you, merry christmas, happy holidays, ashley morrighan hi, this is traci again. i know everyone is waiting to hear what happened with the twin swtich -- i have been waiting too, very impatiently. i finally heard from ashley, and thankfully she and amy have patched things up. or, at least they are speaking to one another. amy apparently discovered and read over this blog and was pretty ticked off... which i think we can all understand. she is now demanding equal time to give her side of what happened. and she wants it before ashley tells everyone how things ended up with the robert situation and the twin swtich. ashley asked me this morning if i would mind posting some blog entries from amy. i don't mind doing it, but i wanted to run it by our audience out there first. i've gotten numerous emails from people over the past 4 or 5 months begging me for information about amy. it looks like you'll finally find out what happened. just let me know if it is something you're still interested in. please just post your opinion on the "comments." and i guess we'll take it from there. thanks, traci campbell, blog administrator hi, this is traci, the blog administrator. ashley asked me to post this message for her. we apologize for the silence on the blog lately (part of it was my fault because i went out of town for two weeks). ashley is still trying to get things straightened out with amy. amy still is trying to tell robert she is ashley, and neither amy nor robert will talk to ashley, ashley's mom, or dad. law school for the semester is winding down. ashley, even though she's ticked off at amy, doesn't want amy to lose her legal education and chance at becoming a lawyer. so, she tried to drop the classes for the semester--saying she needed a leave of absence for family reasons. the dean said no (he sounds like a major jerk to me) about business associations and criminal procedure, since those classes are required. she can, and did, drop the intellectual property class. she also quit being tarkington's research assistant "due to family reasons" that are taking up her time. tarkington apparently was more understanding than the dean... which is good, considering ashley doesn't know squat about legal writing. so where everything stands right now... ashley has no choice but to try and take the final exams for business associations and criminal procedure. we all know it's a long shot...talk about pressure! richard, the guy who worked in the law clinic, is helping her study, by the way. whether or not ashley can pass the exams...i guess we'll have to wait and see. but that is where she is and what is going on right now. i'm sure you'll hear from ashley once the exams are over. keep your fingers crossed for her... traci campbell things have been kind of hectic, and i apologize to everyone for not posting sooner! here's the basic scoop on what's been going on... 1. rogerson seems to have backed off for right now... our operation herb actually seems to have worked! yea!! 2. amy and robert have apparently gotten serious. like way serious. boooo! 3. exams at the law school start in just a few weeks from now... major booooo! 4. and, here's the biggest thing of all...amy is refusing to switch back! monsterous booooo! amy says she's worried about what robert is going to say if she tells him we switched places, so she's continuing to let him think she's me. i tried to call her, and she won't talk to me about it. i've sent emails, and she won't respond. i've been frazzled about this situation, because at first, i thought amy was joking. how can she not come back here? i thought the snow and cold would have sent her back here faster than anything, but i guess robert is keeping her warm...? i also am having a cow about amy abandoning her law school. i understand that things were bad with rogerson--believe me, i understand! but this is ridiculous. we need to come up with a plan, and the plan can't involve the idea of me taking her exams. no matter what she says, i can't think of a worse nightmare than law exams.... i'm flying up tonight to visit my parents for thanksgiving. the only thing i can think to do is explain everything to my parents and see if they can talk some sense into amy. no, amy won't be there. she's having thanksgiving with robert's family... i'll fill you in on other stuff going on (like with mick and the research thing) as soon as i can.

Male: 100%, Male,  i just read this very interesting point/counterpoint piece over on the website of the american academy of family physicians. as you may or may not know, i am a proud family medicine physician. and, yes, i am (still) a dues paying member of the aafp. i owe a lot to the academy including introduction to organizational medicine as well as leadership training as a medical student, family medicine resident, and now. the post i read was in their letter to the editor section and it was called "aafp is 'pawn' in health care reform; academy says 'not so' . the first letter is from former aafp president michael fleming, md. i first met dr. fleming when i was a medical student and i have always respected his opinion - especially on policy issues. here's what he says: as someone who has been involved with advocacy for many years, i'm writing to express my brutal disappointment in the aafp's positioning and effectiveness in the recent health care debate. although family physicians are in critical need of advocacy for their issues -- payment reform, a repeal and permanent fix for the sustainable growth rate, liability reform, recognition of the value of family medicine, graduate medical education reform, etc. -- the aafp seems to have become more enamored of photo opportunities at the white house than the needs of members. in my opinion, the aafp has been used by most of washington as a pawn in a $2 trillion chess game -- and the pawn can never win. the aafp could have taken the high road of quality care for patients and fair payment for the most valuable health care providers. instead, the organization has gone "all in" for one highly partisan bill that will have absolutely no effect on the issues i listed above. the organization and its leaders need to take a close look at themselves and be reminded of the reason the aafp actually exists: to meet the needs of its dues-paying members. the counterpoint to this letter is from current aafp president lori heim, md. this is also someone i have known for a long time and whose opinion i have always respected. the aafp board, to their credit, whether you agree with them or not, has been clear in their position. here's what she said: i appreciate dr. fleming's point of view. but when it comes to health care reform, we have to remain true to the path the aafp congress of delegates approved. we must hold on to the aafp’s long-standing principles of health care for all, a system founded on appropriately paid primary medical care, and a replenished pipeline of family physicians. although not the end game, the health care legislation currently in congress takes important steps in that direction. it expands coverage to more than 30 million americans. with its 10 percent medicare bonus for primary care physicians and pilot testing of the patient-centered primary care medical home, it embarks on reshaping our health delivery system based on primary medical care. and it invests in primary care training by expanding scholarships and student loan forgiveness programs for medical students entering primary care. certainly, the legislation misses the mark in some areas. but the aafp's work in shaping health care reform has put family medicine in good stead for future legislation that will address, for example, the flawed sustainable growth rate formula and potential reform to the medical liability system. far from being a pawn, the aafp has been able to shape the legislation, which shows the first recognition of the value of primary care. nothing is perfect. but we must make a start. the best start we've had in 16 years is the legislation now before congress. now, before you predict some kind of wishy-washy "on the fence" opinion post from me, this may surprise you. it's no secret that i am disenchanted with organized medicine these days - whether it be aafp or the ama - or whatever. i wrote about it in october 2009 . i think a lot of physician organizations are having debates like this one. what do i think? well, in my book, tort reform (ie - liability reform) and having a fix to the flawed sustainable growth rate are important to me and, i think, important to a lot of dues paying members of physician organizations - not to mention the potential negative impact the proposed legislation would have to physician small business owners (those who have not been swallowed up yet by corporate health care systems - or those physicians who already work for government agencies). whatever finally happens, if anything happens with this legislation, i believe that these national physician membership organizations will have used a lot of political capital that will be very difficult to get back. in my opinion, it has already been kind of showing itself in a decreasing number of practicing physicians joining professional organizations, and even some leaving these professional membership organizations. in other instances, state chapters are distancing themselves from their national organizations. for example, the ohio state medical association (which is the state chapter of the american medical association), has all but come out against the current ama position on the known health care reform drafts. when it is all said and done, will it have been worth it for these national organizations? well see.... thursday, march 11,

(which stands for the healthcare information and management systems ) annual meeting. these are the 37 best posts that the medical blogosphere has to offer this week. in my editors picks, i wanted to highlight what i think are well-written stories. there is also a short excerpt from each of my picks this week. also, i invite you to check out coverage of this week's himss conference which include better health's live streaming interviews today and tomorrow (see the video feed and chat room at the bottom of this post). i will also be hosting a himss wrap-up show with dr. val jones on wednesday, march 3rd at 8pm eastern time for the doctor anonymous show 150 which is my live, interactive internet radio show. now, on to grand rounds! dr. a's picks of the week captain atopic , a medical student in australia, sees so much emotion in people's eyes . sitting in the corner of the meeting room, an off-call consultant's eyelids fall. the night registrar talks animatedly and the day team joke. the consultant's patients have been discussed and his coffee hasn't kicked in. the bounce of his chin rouses him. the round passes through a medical ward; eyes look up, eyes dart around. the octogenerian's glassed, cloudy eyes search for focus, and find wanting. the narc'd lady next door sleeps soundly, eyes rolling in an opiate fog. bruce campbell , a physician from the united states, learns that physicians and nurses have a lot to share even when we believe we do not. the patient arrived at the rural clinic near guazapa, el salvador, in his mother’s arms with a mouth gag tied in place and his hands wrapped in bandages. as his mother put him gently onto the examination table, his muscles twitched hard, tearing the paper bed cover and forcing the gag out of his mouth. “be calm,” his mother whispered to him in spanish. he remained contorted but visibly quieted as our pediatrician, dr. mike, held him. kerri sparling , diabetes blogger extraordinaire, shares another side of future mommyhood. i love bsparl. i love her little feet and her pouty lips and that feeling i get when she rolls around inside of me. i love knowing that my daughter is just a few weeks away from becoming a part of our sparling family, and i know that every moment of this pregnancy is completely worth every iota of effort and worry. that being said.... i'm starting to lose my mind a bit. that being said ... i'm starting to lose my mind a little bit. bongi , a physician from south africa, learned early in medical school that consultants only stick to their field . we walked into the tea room where the consultants were hard at work drinking tea and introduced ourselves. the designated tutorial giver groaned audibly. he then glanced over at his colleagues and rolled his eyes. they chuckled. funnily enough i think they thought they were being subtle. after all we were mere medical students and therefore couldn't easily pick up on the finer points of non-verbal communication like specialist psychiatrists could. i was immediately annoyed, but i chose to hide it. the rest of the medical blogosphere's best posts this week the clinical cases and images blog writes about google

Female: 100%, Female, whether it was when i was growing up or with my own family, we have always had a dog. a dog was an integral part of my life, until now. i am dogless. and i miss it.in my growing up family, we had a dog named spot. original, yes? spot was a mutt but she was attractive enough to get a thoroughbred boston bull terrier as her mate and had thirteen little ones that looked just like him. but what i remember most was my mom feeding that dog like you wouldn't believe. i can still see her filling up her dish with everything she could find, piled high and mumbling in swedish under her breath about the poor thing having to feed all those pups. didn't buy dog food in those days. at least, we didn't. (remember this was during or just after the depression.) just table scraps tho i saw mom give her lots of her homemade bread to fill her up with leftover gravy over all.i kept one of the pups and called him pepper. he died of distemper. you see, we didn't have all the shots and stuff like that in those days either. i wrote what i think was my first poem in my grief over his death.in almost 60 years of marriage, we've had numerous dogs. i remember flicka, a sort of black golden retriever looking dog who was a renegade and always running away from home. i would be teaching school at st. edward's catholic school about two blocks from our house and i would see flicka running by. i was in my midlife years then--famous for running to the window and opening them to pant and the kids would all yell,
Male: 100%, Female, first japan , now paris. ikea have kitted out four parisian subway stations with their sofas and lamps for two weeks. the main point of the publicity is to demonstrate the quality and strength of ikea products through the ‘ bum test ’ of thousands of parisians. there's more behind the campaign at the psfk blog if you're going through st. lazare, champs-elysées clémenceau, concorde, and opéra metro stations, you'll have a comfortable rest on the platforms. just hope that the parisian homeless don't catch on to this too quickly, as ikea may find they'll also be testing whether their sofas are stain resistant. there's a great set of pictures on flickr by les favoris where you can see commuters spending more time looking at the sofas rather than actually sitting on them. thanks to freshplastic for finding the ikea links. after ikea in kobe, japan put their furniture in train carriages (see above), we just need ikea in the uk to get in on the act. it would make that wait for your delayed london underground train, much more bearable. it's only one step on from the current round of homebase tv ads where a station in carlisle is decorated! come on ikea, london awaits. london underground's former managing director has had preliminary discussions with tube lines about possibly becoming the contractor's chief exec. this could be interesting as o'toole strongly criticised tube lines while he was in office. perhaps it needs someone like him to help the current acrimonious disputes between lu & tube lines . tube lines hasn't had a permanent chief executive since february 12, when dean finch resigned & became chief executive of national express. tube lines, which works on the jubilee, northern and piccadilly lines, has been the sole surviving contractor since july 2007 when metronet went into administration. tim o'toole left the london underground in april last year and returned to philadelphia to spend more time with his family. david begg, tube lines' chairman, says he had the highest regard for tim o'toole's reputation. but added: " i haven't offered tim o'toole a contract, so i cannot say whether or not tim o'toole is coming ." however according to the evening standard a tube lines spokeswoman said: " i can confirm that we are in contractual negotiations with tim o'toole over the chief executive's job. we are hoping to conclude these discussions soon ." the ft said that boris johnson declined to comment, although they believe that tim o'toole has also held discussions with him. a number of people were lucky enough to bag tickets to a walking tour of the world's first tunnel under a navigable river. victorians last walked through the tunnel in 1865 & now, 145 years later it was opened to the public for two days. the tickets sold out incredibly quickly, but luckily for us a number of people have blogged & very kindly shared photography. matthew knight aka webponce has an amazing set of pictures from the thames tunnel tour . i love the detail of the original brickwork on the archways below. he said " i've always wanted to walk down a tube line, and to be able to walk along the marc brunel thames tunnel was even more special - as the world's first underwater tunnel. much of the original tunnel is still visible at the rotherhithe end. it is amazing to think there were stalls and shops down here. thanks to the guides who showed us around. the thames tunnel is an underwater tunnel, built beneath the river thames in london, united kingdom connecting rotherhithe and wapping. it measures 35 feet (11 m) wide by 20 feet (6 m) high and is 1,300 feet (396 m) long, running at a depth of 75 feet (23 m) below the river's surface (measured at high tide) ." peter watts was also on the tour this morning " along with every other transport nerd ". he said: " the tunnel reopened as a foot tunnel for what we were assured will be the very last time in its history, which is just the sort of hyperbole i like to hear on a friday morning.... the tunnel is now pretty much indistinguishable from any other underground line. the only sense you get that you are heading under the river is that it is rather damp and chilly. although most of the tunnel’s original brickwork has been concreted over, there are some areas where you can still the original bricks, beautiful but damaged. " darryl chamberlain from 853 blog also went along and said " the brickwork had concrete applied to it in the 1990s to protect the tunnel – said to be the leakiest on the underground network – but after a row broke out between london transport and preservation agencies, a small part close to rotherhithe station was left alone. rather than a reminder of how the tunnel was, the existence of the exposed bri just seems to justify the decision to cover it in concrete in the first place ." peter continued: " arches bisect the tunnel throughout its length. these were originally used as small shops, as the tunnel became the world’s first underwater shopping arcade. these spaces are tiny, and would have been cramped, dark, cold and damps places to work from. i imagine they are rather like those booth-cum-shops you get along brixton’s atlantic road, where people flog phonecards and reggae from the stairwells of blocks of flats. here, though, you can get a sense of the detailing that distinguishes so much victorian architecture . peter's visited a number of other subterranean parts of london (deep-level tube shelter at chancery lane) & you can learn about what got him initially hooked at the rest of his great blog post . thanks to both him, darryl chamberlain & matthew for sharing the experience & photos. if you managed to bag a ticket, it would be great to hear what you thought too. remember the days when you could smile smugly in a pub quiz to answer " what's unique about st john's wood london underground station? " it's the only tube station that doesn't share any letters with the word mackerel. a couple of week's ago, you might remember i asked what was unique about pimlico tube . only one person worked out that it was the only station that didn't share any letters with the word badger! now some clever person, ben green, has built a great time wasting tool " badgers in pimlico " so you can type in words and see which stations do not contain its letters. amazingly there's only one station that doesn't have any letters of the word "underground" in it (thanks to @qwghlm for that) and that debden is unique in at least two ways (thanks to paul clarke & richard george for that). have minutes of fun seeing which other tube stations are unique . thanks to fimb for the initial heads up on this! in a bid to save £16m each year, lu has announced it will be losing around 700-800 roles on the tube. in a press release today (where the focus is on " vision for a safe, efficient and transformed tube " - sad how lots of visionary releases tend to hide bad news for other people), london underground stated there would be no compulsory redundancies and they would look to re-focus staff to areas of greater customer need. no changes will be introduced without consultation with staff and trade unions. it's unlikely the unions will take news of cuts lightly, so i bet the likelihood of threats of industrial action to be high. union leaders have already told the bbc of their disappointment with bob crow leader of the rmt in bullish mode & dismissive of lu's safety reassurances: " if these cuts to jobs are bulldozed through by transport for london it will turn london's tube stations into a muggers' paradise ." london underground were clear to state that there would be no ticket office closures. it was rumoured earlier this year that 1,000 jobs would go due to ticket office losses . however the value of service provided at ticket stations, particularly in peak hours, was noted. " the lu proposals would also ensure, therefore, that all stations with a ticket office will continue to do so, with opening hours reduced in some areas to reflect the decline in demand but remaining open at the busiest times to serve customers ." however gerry doherty, general secretary of the tssa, said boris johnson had betrayed staff: " he was elected promising to keep ticket offices fully open and fully staffed. "he has now broken that promise. we shall fight this all the way if any of our members are threatened with compulsory redundancy ." tube officials said the cuts would include 100 managers, 450 ticket office posts and up to 200 other jobs. basically we have the " huge success " of the oyster card to thank for the job cuts. since its launch there has been a sharp decline in ticket sales at station offices with just one in 20 journeys paid for at the counter. iphone users can submit refund claims for london underground delays pretty quickly with the launch of two apps. under the customer charter, if you're delayed by more than 15 minutes, you're entitled to claim the cost of your single journey on the tube. tfl's website actually is fine for making a claim , but with an iphone app, many people might be more likely to remember to do it. you can literally claim while your delay takes place. the company behind tube refund , one of the apps, says that there were approximately 1,996 delays across the tube network last year (38 delays a week). hopefully you're not going to get that amount personally, but the which only costs 59p, could pay for itself pretty quickly. the other app irefund is $0.99 has fewer ratings than tube refund. if you have an iphone give one a try, when you're next delayed. they'll make a useful edition to the other london underground iphone apps reviewed last year. thanks to techcrunch for the heads up on this. in the ongoing funding row with tube lines upgrade work, tfl are considering legal action after arbiter, chris bolt says london underground has to raise £4,465m for ppp costs. in a final determination of the costs, the arbiter believes that tube lines' increased estimate by £65m for the cost of the next seven and half years of work is correct. boris johnson & tfl are none too happy about this and with a rebel rousing yell, boris said " the arbiter has ruled that the costs should be £4.46bn, thus demonstrating that tube lines' breathtaking original demand for £6.8bn was simply an attempt at daylight robbery. "londoners will also be outraged that the tube upgrades promised to them are now threatened. "simply put, we are being asked to write a blank cheque in order to prop up an ailing and failing tube lines, and to guarantee massive and secretive payments of £400m to its shareholders, ferrovial and bechtel. "in other countries this would be called looting, here it is called the ppp ." the fighting talk continues with " we will fight this to the last and are seeking urgent advice on the arbiter's idea to pass tube lines' obligations to raise finance on to london's fare and taxpayers. "we are therefore examining all our options, including legal remedies. " tube lines are quietly saying that co-operation is needed " it will be essential that it (the contract) is underpinned with a strong partnership between tube lines and london underground and that both parties embrace the parameters of the agreement. " unlikely with talk of a legal fight & boris's sparring words. andrew cleaves, tube lines' acting chief executive, said " it is clear that the arbiter has relied on international benchmarking to help drive down public spending and is expecting both us and london underground to become more efficient still by adopting some of the delivery methods used by other, more modern metro systems around the world. this will require a step change in the way that tube lines and london underground work together. we will wholeheartedly welcome working more closely with lu to simplify and modernise working practices on the underground and give tube passengers more, for less ." also earlier in the week tfl's interim managing director richard parry wrote to bolt warning that the missing £400m would have to be found by taxpayers, in the form of higher fares, or else planned upgrade work to the piccadilly line would have be shelved. in today's press release parry said " the jubilee and northern line upgrades are seriously delayed and over budget as a result of tube lines' failure to deliver, a fact now confirmed by both the ppp arbiter and an independent qc earlier this year ." looks like the war of words could be moving to legal arena and in the meantime, us commuters continue to bear the brunt of the stupid ppp plan, with delays to upgrades & increased fares to fund the mess. microsoft's search engine bing kicks off its uk tv advertising tonight with a london underground setting. looks like the simple question of where to catch a tube to euston is taken to extremes - unless they've been looking at the human body as a tube map diagram. hopefully, this won't lead to a round of information overload for people asking for directions on the tube. and welcome if you've come here, after searching for the london underground on bing. you might not find what you're looking for, but hopefully can have fun on the way. 
Female: 100%, Female,  today is such a beautiful day! it's a day to celebrate friendship, it's a day to celebrate life and it's most definitely a day to celebrate love! i've always believed that love is something that we should show all throughout the year. why wait for one special day to let the people in your life that matter know just how important they are to you? i try to make it my business to show my affection and appreciation all year long, but it is kinda fun to make that little extra effort on this one day.one of my favourite quotes is "you know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams." -dr. seusswho knew dr. seuss was so thoughtful, lol, but i couldn't agree with him more!happy valentine's day everyone....it's gonna be a lovely day:-) i came across this song, "are you listening?" produced by kirk franklin. along with a many of today's best gospel artists , he recorded this song to help to raise money for the people in haiti in conjunction with unicef. not only is the song absolutely beautiful, but the proceeds are obviously going to a great cause. listen, enjoy and do your part to help if you haven't already done so. i remember years ago before i had a blackerry, before i knew anything about having this type of instant access to the worldwide web, to e-mails, to google
Male: 100%, Female, if you'd been wondering if draft blogger was worth trying, any doubts should be erased right now. you need draft blogger to take advantage of the new template design features currently in beta. truly, this is not something to wait for it to be released into blogger proper. the thing is as flexible as can be. not only are there 4 basic new templates, each with a few versions, but most of them let you change the background to one of a large variety of designs or stock photos.the fun doesn't end there. you can also customize the layout, and by customizing, i mean you can customize the overall layout of the blog's body and then pick a layout for the footer, which allows for a whole lot of variations. you can also vary the widths of the blog and the sidebars. then you can move around your page elements/gadgets and choose colors if you don't like the defaults, and you have control over background colors for the page as well as for the gadgets, links, text, etc. as before, you can add in any header image you want, using the header element/gadget. i would think you can also use your own background images if you upload them somewhere, ie to picasa, by going into the html and coding it in place of the images that come with the template. i haven't tried that yet. 
Female: 100%, Female, i love what brooke had to say about the event, and also the tidbit of advice she shared of how eunice & sabrina's father would read them chapter books each night, like treasure island. doesn't the wedding look like it is out of a inviting and captivating storybook?(photos by gia canali &amp; sara remington) i popped by the saipua website this morning, and was very inspired. gorgeous, gorgeous. a beautiful, modern and minimally styled norwegian ski get away cottage --- yes, please. it is designed by architects henriette salvesen and christopher adams.(images by vincent leroux from maire claire maison) oh, the sandals that are showing up all over the place -- i am loving some of the styles. here are a few of my favorites, although they are a bit on the pricey side.1: sam edelman dawson gladiator $129.952: antelope maya $1323: jeffrey campbell tier $724: cynthia vincent odeon $250 cameron moll has come out with another lovely work of art. the colosseo letterpress poster is now available. isn't it amazing?! it is cool to watch the video clip on the site to see the process. 
Female: 100%, Female,  my handspun yarn: madder, weld, walnut, camomile in recent years spinning (with a hand spindle) is something i've enjoyed during winter evenings, but this past winter i looked at the spindle and the wool and just did not feel motivated. some winters are like that for me. i get tired easily because of the lack of sunshine. then recently i began to think again about all the wool i have stored, some dyed and some undyed, and felt inspired. so, this time around i am spinning for spring, and so am working toward a spring project. at the moment i'm dyeing and spinning and then will begin to knit some kind of simple scarf-throw project. i'll begin the knitting on the spring equinox, the day i consider to be that all important 'first day of' - so that's this saturday. i'll knit and continue to dye wool and spin, and will work through april, hoping to complete sometime in early may. but there's no rush. this is a project for myself, something to enjoy in the evenings now the days feel longer. the wool used is a mix of british breeds: shetland, shropshire and falklands, and some merino i have had for a while. mostly these days if i buy wool tops to dye/spin it will be from a supplier who sells rare british breeds because i find that more interesting to use. i'll hope to share the project as it moves along - in simple stripes of natural colours. i am not a very adept knitter, i like to keep it simple and can't be asked to follow knitting pattern instructions! i'll be knitting the singles rather than plyed wool because i find i can spin quite balanced singles and they knit up quite pleasantly enough. i'm dyeing the wool using mostly my tried and tested solar jar method. for dyes such as weld, i am cooking up the dried dyestuff and then straining the dye solution, pouring it into a jar to use. some dyes, such as madder, will work well if put into the jar and covered with hot water from the kettle, but weld and alkanet for another example are dyestuffs that from my experience need a little more persuasion. i really like the yellows of weld on wool, and yellows will be the main hue for this spring project. as a brief follow-on from yesterday's post, examples of handwriting using the same monoprint method. yes you do need to write in mirror style. so i am constantly telling myself: b is d and d is b...... these will become something more in the near future. thank you very much for all your comments re: yesterdays monoprint drawing post. i'm pleased you found it interesting. a drawing and its inky shadow.... the various attempts i made, working toward the one drawing i decided to use. i had the idea of a figure seated on a chair, a shape of a figure rather than a detailed human person. but the figure wears shoes. and the chair, because chairs are one of my 'things', had to be just a very simple form. the figures are all rather bizarre because i drew with my eyes closed. yes, i do like a challenge.... but i knew this was the way for me to get the result i had in mind.... above are photos i took whilst working on drawings for my latest zine 'dreamers' (still a few copies available in my shop ). today (no mosaic this monday, next week) - i thought i would finally write about my own approach to making monoprint drawings. i've written before, but several people have asked me to explain a little about how etc.. and i'm happy to put this post together, as my own technique and approach changes over time. making these drawings does not require a printers press or any other specialist equipment. i like to make things that require the most basic of things: needle and thread, paper and pencil, and for monoprint drawing: ink/paint, glass, paper, drawing tool. i use a sheet of glass from an old picture frame. i use either printers ink (the type you might use for lino) or water-mixable oil paint. in recent times i have preferred the latter as i like the thickness and texture of the paint, it has a slow drying time and allows a variety of results: from very inky and dark, to cloudy, to light and fine lines. the paint/ink is spread across the glass quite evenly and if you prefer you can use a roller, but i use my fingers because i like the slight uneven and fingerprinty result. when i am making monoprint drawings i am working toward an expressive image, perhaps primitive, minimalist even. there are some drawings that are more elaborate but mostly i'm not aiming toward the fine exactness of an etching, for example. i'm happy to play with chance. my drawings with pencil are very different. when i draw in my sketchbook (see sketchbook sundays posts for examples), i use the eraser as a tool for both editing and blending. and i will make many adjustments sometimes before i get a pencil drawing just so. with monoprint drawing there is no rubbing out and editing a certain area, though you can work with 'mistakes' and go with the flow. a sheet of paper is placed over the inked glass and then you draw. once you have finished drawing, you flip over the paper and there is your monoprinted image. i draw with a long darning needle. so when i am drawing i am just denting gently into the paper and not making any easily seen impression. i have to work in good light so that i can see the finely dented lines. or i can take advantage of not seeing my drawing and can work 'blind', which offers interesting results too. either way, i have to be careful not to lean on the paper too much, although a few inky smudges made my fingers holding the paper in place are quite acceptable and desirable for me. it's all about finding your own style and technique of working, of course. i'm showing many examples here but urge anyone who wishes to try monoprint drawing to draw in their own way and to learn through experience, which does take paper and time. finding your own way of making marks is that big leap toward feeling like you are making something that is truly your own. i can get inspired by other artists, of course, but return again and again to my own obsessions..... here's an example of quite a tiny drawing - showing you the inked glass image too. you can see here there is a modest about of paint smeared across the glass. this drawing was made after several previous drawings. here's the first drawing i made during a brief session this morning. i had prepared the glass and left it a short while to allow the water-based oil paint to dry just a little. i thought i would work on a simple series of drawings to demonstrate - so chose one of my 'things' - long-eared things, rabbits and hares.... i made a series of little quirky rabbit drawings. because my inked glass was smaller than the paper area, i lifted and shifted the paper, so that's why the glass does not match up with the drawing! i attempted to draw a girl holding a rabbit. wishing to aim for a quite primitive drawing. you can see my attempts starting left to right. i like the first drawing best - because it features an echo of a previous drawing left in the ink, and because i like the really smudgy drawings. shadow girl and rabbit various drawings showing the different quality of line achieved in one drawing session. here you can see my first drawing in the centre and then as i continued to draw so i switched paper to a smoother cartridge paper that is best for showing fine line. further tips: experiment with using different inks, paints and colours. do not limit yourself to one type of paper. i also try and use old envelopes, fabric, tissue paper etc.... if you are wishing to try this with young children or less able folk, and would prefer not to use glass - then try very glossy paper or plastic folders. just smear the paint/ink across very thinly and experiment. i've made drawings in the past using the cover of an old magazine as my 'glass'. you can also use perspex of course. instead of drawing with a needle as i do, other drawing tools to use are of course etching tools, pointed tips of ceramics tools, sharpened pencils, cocktail sticks. i hope this post has been both insightful and interesting to you. this week i am very busy working toward many new things for my shop update on the 24th. i'm also dyeing lots of wool for a particular project but i'll write about that tomorrow. have a happy monday x this last one is still in progress. it is in my new a3 size moleskine - so much bigger. this book will be a challenge for me. i've still quite a lot of work to do on this one, i feel, but have taken a shot just to record where i am at today. you never know, this one might change quite radically or may wait a while before i work on it some more. i've also been writing notes toward new poems. and spinning dyed wool to knit a spring throw. i'll share more of this project next week. it has been mothering sunday in the uk today. a lovely spring day. i hope you had a good one. a 'yesterdays' in grey and gold.... i wanted to make a more elaborate doll - with ruffles. her skirt is edged with vintage velvet ribbon. she is a 'salon couture ruffles' kind of girl. thank you for your kind comments/feedback re: my zine! i am pleased to know those who have received (uk people mostly of course) are enjoying this one. this helps me to know, cheers me as i continue to think on new ideas for both drawing and poetry. i wish you a very good weekend x a drawing from my sketchbook printed on to cotton and made into a small pillow. the pillow measures 5 inches tall and is filled with a mix of lavender with polyester stuffing. the reverse side is grey cotton (hand dyed with alkanet). i love lavender and lavender pillows. they can come in so many shapes and sizes. i've also sewn, for myself, a very simple linen dyed with alkanet pillow. i just like things very simple, some times. and as much as i love spring colours, i'm also in love with grey all year round. perhaps this is why i like pencil drawings, pebbles, grey foliage plants, grey dresses and grey rabbits. 1. winter into spring , 2. untitled , 3. day 64 , 4. mulberry eye , 5. untitled , 6. tomber amoureux , 7. untitled , 8. #2 inside ourselves , 9. togetherness , 10. printingcloth1 , 11. untitled , 12. épilogue or bravely drifting monoprint , 13. rosiness pin , 14. rabbit on a carpet , 15. proceed , 16. march drawing # 1 , 17. innenbild20100303 , 18. folded , 19. rainy day ii | 27-02-10 , 20. untitled created with fd's flickr toys a bright, frosty start to the week here! many thanks to the artists and photographers featured here for sharing their work via my flickr contacts. i've chosen a gentle selection, letting in the light and shade of spring.... it really does, finally, feel as if we are moving toward the next brighter season here. just a few flowers can make such a big difference. this week i've plenty to do, as always. i've got packages to send out following my shop update (thank you). there are still a few copies of my zine available. my next update will be in a few weeks time. i'll put the date here on the blog when it is decided. there will be more yesterdays! i only had a few in last friday's selection - i shall offer a few more next time, as i do get requests and thanks. also, my natural dyed fabrics are currently 'coming soon' in the shop. this means i am busy dyeing new new new - and by the end of this week i hope to have enough stock to make available again. thanks for your interest. i'm enjoying my recent drawing and writing notes toward new poems. i've not updated nevering for a while. this is because i am working toward new poems for a collection - this takes time and there is a slow brew of ideas coming..... spring usually brings a new energy to my writing. as i watch the birds and the sun lengthens the day, so my notebooks might get a little more inspired. it is paying attention to the small details of the day and adding these together, making something a little magical from the mix.... there are a few collaborative projects i am working on and i'll share more about them soon. looking ahead to april already, i am thinking of doing some kind of month-long project. perhaps like my november painted book. but i am still thinking on..... i hope you have a very good week and more soon x new sketches in my small moleskine sketchbook this weekend i spent some time in the garden tidying, seeing the bulbs i planted last autumn making their way through. lovely.... but it was cold so i worked quickly and took tea breaks, and sketched..... enjoy the rest of your sunday 
Female: 100%, Female,  dreaming of traveling to buenos aires, argentina? the makers of bueno, entonces... , the hot new spanish language learning software , are trying to build their facebook cred by reaching 10,000 fans by march. if they get there, one lucky fan and a friend will win a trip to buenos aires, argentina , for 10 days of intensive spanish lessons, a chance to meet the cast and crew (and me, too!) and of course, have way too much fun. from now until march 12th, bueno, entonces... is offering a series of contests on the facebook page, which offers free daily spanish phrases, words and grammar lessons. 100 participants will be chosen as finalists from the series of contests and will be entered to win the grand prize trip. the complete contest details are posted on the bueno, entonces...fan page . they've to a super-simple photo contest. to enter, just snap a picture of yourself holding a sign saying "i want to win a trip to argentina" and post it to their facebook wall. then get your friends to 'like' and comment on it. but hurry! the ten finalists with the most 'likes' will be selected on friday (february 5). so polish up your tango shoes and hurry and go check it out. about the program: bueno, entonces... is like rosetta stone meets the simpsons - the program is comprehensive, but at the same time hilarious and really engaging. just released last year, it has been already featured in the itunes app store and on the daily candy website. to see more, check out their learn spanish website . i have taken my share of spanish classes, believe me. some were good, some were...not so good. but none were as funny or as motivating as the bueno, entonces... program. witty and wry, with more than a bit of adult humor, it's like watching a favorite tv show--you can't wait for the next episode! though it's definitely geared to the twentysomething crowd, even old folks like tom and me laughed out loud during many of the lessons. it's sexy--in a fun way. and since this is the sexy spanish club blog, well, i feel that i must recommend this as it is the sexiest spanish-learning program out there. the two characters--the hot argentine teacher (jimena) and the kinda goofy student (david) definitely develop a certain...chemistry. it makes it fun. will they--or won't they? i'm not telling. ;-) for those planning on visiting argentina, you should know that this is the only argentine-oriented spanish program available. it tells you how to pronounce things the argentine way and includes plenty of cultural references and helpful (and entertaining) slang. plus, it's portable: it can be instantly downloaded to your ipod, iphone, smartphone, or laptop. no need for that sweaty bus or subte ride to a class, and no books to lug around--just plug in and learn...and laugh! what are you waiting for, gringo? get started on your own sexy spanish here . no, not really. though it's true that my husband and i just bought a small farm in uruguay , we are keeping our studio apartment in buenos aires and plan to visit regularly. after all, it's only two hours away and we have two daughters living in buenos aires and many friends--and though we plan to live a quiet life in the country (focusing on farming and writing) we will want a blast of city life every now and then! why did we buy the farm? it was unexpected. we visited some friends--an expat couple, british and french, who had spent twenty years in new york--who had just purchased a farm. we saw how they were living, and it was just so appealing that we couldn't get the idea out of our heads. two weeks later, we'd bought our own place (or at least, started the process). the real estate transaction went very well--quick, smooth, very nice owners who worked with us directly without using an agent. what appeals to us about it is the challenge of living even more simply , of connecting to the land, developing (re-developing...i grew up on a farm) our skills in terms of planting, growing and harvesting our own food, and living in a 90-year-old farmhouse without succumbing to our american instincts to redo and rebuild. it's beautifully simple as is, but not perfect--and we are looking forward to being okay with that. most of all, we love the idea of investing in land, of being in a beautiful place and getting to know our neighbors in a setting that encourages cooperation, bartering, and sharing. and okay, i can't help but think that it will be a really fun place for our eventual grandkids to visit. ;-) but buenos aires is in my heart and always will be. i love it, and i really appreciate the creativity of the people (locals and expats). it inspires me, makes me think, makes me laugh, and helps me appreciate life. i know i'll feel the same way about life on the farm in uruguay--but in different ways. thought i'd update this blog--i'm posting regularly on my new globals blog these days. i've even posted some fun little videos about finding my book in barnes &amp; noble and meeting my agent for the first time (i wrote the book in argentina and did everything via email!) and most recently, seeing my book in a bookstore window here in new york . my book , the new global student: skip the sat, save thousands on tuition, and get a truly international education , was published by random house on the 19th, and tom and i are in new york for a month. generally, authors do a book tour sort of thing, but we're doing things differently ! we've had a great time hanging out with three of our daughters here, celebrated when our oldest earned her master's degree (at 23) and started a new job this week, and just enjoying life in the east village. we were excited to see the print edition of smithsonian magazine on the racks this week! as i'm sure many of you know, their cover story for the june edition is about living in buenos aires, and several expats are quoted, including me. thanks for that, daniel politi! ;-) the interview was done well over a year ago, but the timing worked out very well as it was published the same week as my book launched ! there was a glitch in the shipment of books to the many education bloggers, organizations and others who were supposed to receive an early copy in order to build some buzz. we found out just last week that the books are still sitting in the warehouse ! argh. this seriously hampers marketing efforts, as you can imagine, so we're doing a little damage control and scrambling. in fact, things are likely to pick up in a big way soon: later this week, a short feature on the book will be published in usa today and a review is scheduled to appear in the boston globe either the 7th or the 14th (sunday editions). i've had some radio interviews and podcasts so far and tom and i are learning a lot in our lunch sessions with parents (a group of parents buys us lunch, we listen to their concerns about their kids' education and share tips). in fact, we had a fabulous one in westport, connecticut last friday with a dozen people in attendance. tom was the only guy, but hey, he's used to that. most of all, we're just enjoying the moment and feeling grateful for the opportunity to have a book published and get a chance to share this message with those who can benefit from it. if you or someone you know is strugging with college costs, disheartened by the college-prep hassle, looking for inexpensive ways to study abroad, or just ready to hear some good news about u.s. education , i hope you'll consider reading or recommending my book! learn more at http://www.newglobalstudent.com it's also full of inspiring stories and helpful advice for anyone-- especially families --considering spending time abroad. and to all you aspiring writers in buenos aires and elsewhere---keep at it! two years ago, i had no idea what i would write about and though i hoped i'd write a book someday, i was like millions of other people with the same vague dream. keep dreaming, but more importantly, keep writing! you just never know where it can take you. yep. it's true. oh, it's not that we don't love it. it's been fantastic. we chose this location (just on the edge of belgrano) three years ago when we had two daughters living with us, and it couldn't have been more perfect in terms of proximity to their schools--islands international school and universidad de belgrano, and an easy bus or train ride to lincoln university college. just a couple of blocks from the subte d line (congreso de tucuman stop, so you almost always get a seat!) and four blocks from the nuñez train station, with bus 29 running right in front of our apartment as well. we have great neighbors and our sweet little street is quiet with very friendly people. our building? love it. only three years old, with a lovely pool and parilla area on the roof, a small gym, and a large sauna. there are only two apartments on each floor, and ours is facing the back instead of the street. despite the fact that we're only a couple of blocks from cabildo, what wakes us up in the morning is birds in the trees below (we're on the seventh floor). so, why are we selling it? well, regular readers will know that i just wrote a book and in may, tom and i will be going to the us for the book launch and promotional tour...and we have no idea how long we will be staying. it could be two months, but it might be six or eight months, depending on speaking engagements and other opportunities. also, we purchased a studio apartment in palermo, right on paraguay (between armenia and malabia) that has been under construction and will be completed in the next month or so. plus, our four daughters seem reasonably launched and as empty nesters, we just don't need three bedrooms. we really like to change things up, and we've always wanted to try living in a studio apartment, so tom and i are excited to move into the little one. that means we've decided to sell this one, despite our daughters' concerns (we've assured them that we're likely to buy another place--with at least a spare bedroom--once we get back here after the tour stuff is over). luckily, the wonderful realtor who sold us this place--javier--is a friend and is helping us sell this one as well. he works with cristian bau realtors here in buenos aires and he's such a good man, a pleasure to work with and we trust him completely. by the way, buying property here isn't hard as long as you've got the cash since there aren't really any mortgages--we saw this place, bought it and moved into it--all within a month. so, anyway--if you or someone you know might be interested in buying a really nice three-bedroom, two bath apartment in a great location--and we're happy to sell most of the furnishings as well for a very reasonable price--let us know. it's been a fantastic place for our family and i know that whoever ends up lucky enough to live here next will enjoy it as much as we have. to see the listing with photos, go to: (sold--never mind!) maya is hard at work on her other blogs so i (her husband tom) wanted to use her traffic to recommend a guided kayak tour of the delta that i took last week. i have been up to tigre and the delta several times, it is only about 30 minutes from our apartment in belgrano via train. though the town of tigre itself is worth a trip, i generally skip it to get out to the islands in the delta. generally we have taken the interisla collectivos (passenger boats that act as buses between the islands) and have gotten off at a restaurant pier or someplace else to go hiking. we have also rented a house for a weekend. but, what i really wanted to do was explore the myriad of small canals and channels that the larger boats cannot get into. based on fellow expat jonathan harada's advice ( http://tutoramigos.blogspot.com ) we contacted martin at www.eldoradokayak.com . martin met us at the station and had already purchased tickets for the collectivo (boat) out to their island camp. i have been on the same route before though it was totally different as martin is very knowledgeable about the delta and during the entire 1.5 hour boat ride he gave us great information about the route. the last stop of the collectivo is their camp/house. serenely quiet, the small canal had very few houses. all that we could hear was the winds in the leaves and the chirping of the birds. martin's partner chapa had a light lunch ready for us, set nicely around a picnic table in the jungle clearing. their house is simple but new, clean with full changing and shower facilities. after a brief instruction on paddling techniques we set off in double and singles--very stable kayaks that were almost brand new. time is different in the delta and the two-three hours we spent blissfully paddling the small canals and channels flew by. my two daughters were hesitant to go initially (worried they were not strong enough) and completely enjoyed the experience. our route took us through darker narrow passages as well as past grand houses on one of the larger rivers and then into seemingly untouched portions of jungle. when we got back, a lovely lunch of sausage sandwiches, tomato salad and vino patero awaited. chapa and martin are wonderful conversationalists and our hour lunch turned into a three hour (again time in the delta is different) discussion of argentine politics, culture and life on the delta. when you visit buenos aires take this tour, you will not be disappointed. i have traveled a fair bit and the delta is like nowhere i have been before and eldorado kayaks let me see it up close and personal. some people like to do the look-back-over-the-last-year thing on december 31st. i prefer to do the what-a-cool-year-it's-going-to-be thing on new year's day. for the frost family, lots of good things are in store and already in motion. observe: --my book, the new global student , will be in bookstores on may 19th. so the next six months will be devoted to pre-launch publicity as well as sketching out book two. lots of exciting times ahead as we start to get media attention for the book! --tom and i are working together. we worked together as english teachers in rural japan when we met back in 1983, and over the years, we've had businesses together and worked side by side. but we've always had our own projects. this year, i am very excited that he will be working directly with me on the business/nonprofit projects related to my book! we've always been far better together than apart, so there's no stopping us now! ;-) --our oldest daughter (she is 22) will complete her master's in may. she's been working full time in addition to earning her master's so may will bring some relief but also new opportunities. cool! --daughter number two (just turned 21) graduated from college in december and finished two internships in manhattan--one at a latino ad agency, one at mtv international. now, she is very happily working in an irish pub (she loves it!) while saving money and also working as a freelancer for the ad agency. it's great to learn how to do freelance work (and negotiate for good pay) at the age of 21. this weekend, she is moving into a new apartment (she's been living with her older sister since august) and is thrilled to be living in new york and doing her thing. --daughter number three also graduated from college in december (she is 19) and was offered a job as a multilingual events coordinator for a major cruise line. unfortunately, the earliest they can place her in a position is march, so she is arriving in buenos aires today to spend the next couple of months relaxing, traveling and possibly pursuing other work options if the cruise thing is taking too long. --daughter number four (she is 18) is here in buenos aires now on her winter break from college in upstate new york. it's a chance to visit us, visit her boyfriend (okay, we know he gets top billing) and see what it's like to come back to argentina after being away for a few months. she's going to meet her boyfriend's family out in the campo (country) for a few days, which should be interesting. she'll return to new york in a couple of weeks, continue her studies, and do an internship this summer. it looks like she'll graduate with a bs in applied psychology (organizational psych, really) in december. it's a year of growth, opportunities and changes--exactly what we love best. ;-) happy new year, everyone! tom and i had a great time at normal 0 mar de ajó--just the two of us, the beach, the sun. though i expected more wistful moments--this being our first christmas in 22 years without kids--there were actually just a few, and we thoroughly enjoyed celebrating christmas in a sleepy beach town. it's not sleepy now, though--the holiday crowds were arriving as we left! there was much painting and sprucing up being done during the time we were there. it was great to be the only foreigners around--everywhere we went, people asked where we were from, were very friendly and interested and we had delightful conversations with the locals we met. not so nice--i caught tom's cold (i guess i had time to get sick, so i did!) and thanks to some pretty horrible coughing yesterday, i seem to have a cracked (or at the very least, very sore) rib. so, just as i was during my recovery from gum surgery a few months back, i am very quiet. it hurts to breathe, let alone talk, laugh or (ouch!) cough. but the good news is that i got my first blurb for my book--from dan pink , author of a whole new mind. i loved dan's book so i am utterly thrilled and humbled and awed that he wrote such a nice blurb for my book cover. here it is: "with considerable verve and tremendous insight, maya frost offers a primer on how to take your education -- and your life -- into your own hands. the new global student is essential reading for any family yearning to step off the treadmill and plunge into the world." -- daniel h. pink, author of a whole new mind nice, huh? i am looking forward to getting more blurbs soon--they are being sent to my editor at random house/crown and she is out of the office until january 6th. dan just sent his along to me as a courtesy since he knew i was on pins and needles. it's especially meaningful coming from dan as he is a father of three and took his kids on a sabbatical to japan while doing research for his manga career guide, the adventures of johnny bunko . so...quiet....and thrilled. not a bad way to spend the next couple of days. ;-) 
Female: 100%, Female,  is your mouth watering yet? after about eating my weight in strawberries this weekend, i pureed the rest and tested out this strawberry lemonade bar recipe from baking bites .&nbsp; it is fabulous! these perfectly pink beauties are going to be one of many treats on a dessert buffet i am putting together for an upcoming church party.&nbsp; i'm no amy atlas , but i'm really excited to do a dessert buffet. do you know of any wonderful pink desserts? thanks for subscribing! last night i went out with a bunch of mama's from oscar's playgroup.&nbsp; and i realized beforehand that i don't have any bags that aren't a diaper bag, tote bag, or something else large enough to accommodate sippy cups and goldfish crackers. so ... i made this little clutch using the scrappy clutch tutorial at from an igloo . it was a quick (like during nap time quick) and easy project - my favorite kind!&nbsp;&nbsp; the only change i made was to pleat the bottom of the bag instead of gathering it, because my lining fabric was too thick and refused to be gathered. it is a wee bag that will only hold the essentials, but it was such a relief to not lug a big bag out the door!&nbsp; i think i like it as a clutch and love it as a make-up bag.&nbsp;&nbsp; i'm going to try again with something of my own design, longer, maybe narrower, and this time i think i'll cut my fabric more thoughtfully so the pattern lines up nicely (duh). in a bit of non-craft business, can i just rave about santa barbara for a moment?&nbsp; oscar and i were at the park today when i spotted a little meadow, chock-full of yellow daisies.&nbsp; it spoke to me.&nbsp; it said, "come over here and frolic and take pictures of your adorable son!"&nbsp; so i did, and it was kind of great. and then on the drive home, i saw the strawberry van that is always parked on the side of the road with a sign that says, "picked today!" and couldn't pass it up.&nbsp; i really like living in the center of the strawberry-growing universe. p.s. sorry to those of you living in winter wonderlands.&nbsp; :) thanks for subscribing! someone had a magical time at disneyland ... oscar proved himself a little daredevil, and went on every ride with me.&nbsp; we had so much fun! we've been spending the last several days trying to feel human again after too much partying and not enough napping.&nbsp; i think we're just about there. sorry i don't have anything new to share today!&nbsp; craft time is resuming tonight. thanks for subscribing! some of the best people in the world flew into california for the weekend and we are all spending a couple of days at disneyland.&nbsp; no crafts to be spoken of ... just fun rides, a monte cristo sandwich , lots of board games, and hopefully a good dose of child-like wonder. i made some simple mickey shirts for our little guys to wear, freezer paper stenciled, as usual.&nbsp; i keep getting the same question - where can you buy freezer paper?&nbsp; you should be about to find it at any grocery store.&nbsp; i buy reynold's brand, and it is usually right next to the aluminum foil and saran wrap. have a happy weekend! thanks for subscribing! time for another maternity refashion.&nbsp; i found this blue t-shirt on clearance at target for $1.50 (sorry there's no "before" photo).&nbsp; it was about two sizes larger than i would buy pre-pregnancy, which was perfect for the refashion. all i did was add 1/4" elastic to both side seams.&nbsp; i started just below the bust, secured the elastic with a few stitches, and then stretched the elastic as i sewed down the seam using a zig-zag stitch (the more you stretch the elastic, the more gathered the fabric will be).&nbsp; i stopped the elastic about 1/2" above the bottom hem of the shirt. here's what it looks like from the inside (not my tidiest work, but oh well): very easy!&nbsp; you still have plenty of room for the growing bump, and don't have to wear a tent.&nbsp; hurray for that. thanks for subscribing! we're having a girl!&nbsp; i sure hope my sewing machine is up to the task. thanks for subscribing! i finally finished my totes and burp cloths for my giveaway winners last night.&nbsp; sorry they took so long to sew, ladies!&nbsp; i'm putting them all in the mail today. girlfiend and meghan will be recieiving a spring tote.&nbsp; do you love this fabric like i do?&nbsp; it is called flourish floral tiles turquoise by studio e fabrics .&nbsp; &nbsp; if you want to make one for yourself, just follow my easy spring tote tutorial (now updated with additional fabric dimensions if you don't want to use tea towels)! &nbsp; &nbsp; lizzy will receive a set of 4 baby burp cloth s.&nbsp; i really love this flannel - it is bright and cheery. &nbsp; that's all for now.&nbsp; i have a big doctor's appointment today.&nbsp; any predictions on if i'll get to use the pink baby blanket i've been crocheting all week? thanks for subscribing! this weekend was my hubby's 30th birthday.&nbsp; i've always thought that 30 is the perfect age.&nbsp; prime of your life. anyway, i had plans to continue the geek-cake tradition started last year, but jared requested a chocolate pie.&nbsp; i needed something special and homemade to add to his birthday, so i made him a freezer paper stenciled space invaders t-shirt using this cross-stitch pattern as my guide. &nbsp; while i was in stencil-mode, i made a birthday t-shirt for me and oscar.&nbsp; oscar's said "i love daddy" and mine said "i love jared." jared was so embarrassed when i wore my shirt out in public.&nbsp; but if you can't proclaim your love on a t-shirt, what's the point?&nbsp; :) &nbsp; thanks for subscribing! 
Male: 100%, Female, if you knew me when, you'd know i used to watch many more movies than i do now. when i started with netflix in 2004, i saw about 300 movies each year. lately, i've managed one dvd from netflix each week, and one theatrical title each week. i saw only 171 movies in 2009! pitiful. the netflix rating granulizer for greasemonkey does exactly that. install this extension in your browser, and you'll be able to assign ratings with half a star. i used it to give the imaginarium of doctor parnassus 3.5 stars. it's better than ok, but i didn't really like it. i have rated over 3000 titles on netflix.com. i use netflix as my main repository of movie ratings. i like to know how i rated a movie, in case someone asks me. sometimes i can't remember if i've seen a movie, or if i liked it enough to see it again, so i refer to my netflix rating. having to refer to netflix is inconvenient sometimes. i don't want to have to start over from scratch with ratings on every movie web site. what if i quit netflix? what's going to happen to all those ratings? now i can keep them. the likeminds web app allows you to take your netflix ratings with you, or move them from one web site to another. right now, you can export ratings from amazon, blockbuster, flixster, imdb, movielens, netflix, rottentomatoes, and yahoo, and import to amazon, blockbuster, movielens, netflix, and rottentomatoes. they will be adding others. it took about 10 minutes for my 3030 ratings to be imported from netflix into likeminds.com. it took about a minute to download them to a file on my laptop. it's in alpha at the moment, so they are looking for feedback on problems or features and are quick to respond. let me know if you use it, and what your experience is. netflix has been around for 12 years. i can hardly believe it was already seven years old when i joined in 2004. however, there are still folks out there who have never joined. i was at the doctor's office a few weeks ago, and was shocked that my nurse didn't know how netflix worked. i reckon alot of you never considered trying netflix until someone gave you a gift subscription. so, if you got netflix for christmas, and you are a total newbie, please leave a comment. i'd love to meet you. tell us what you think. the leonard maltin iphone/ipod touch app i posted about is on sale at the itunes store for $2.99, down from $4.99. it's based on his paperback movie guide. i reckon the price drop is because of how slow the search feature is. also, you can't find things by keyword. you have to know the exact title or name, or at least the beginning letters. if you search for movie titles containing the word "henry", you'll get henry v, but not the private life of henry viii. even with these problems, i still love and recommend the app. get it while it's on sale, and you'll get free updates when they fix these problems. netflix recommends i watch wings of desire (1987) , and predicts that i will give it 3.9 stars , based on my feelings for nosferatu the vampyre (with bruno ganz), downfall (a great movie also starring bruno ganz) and big (!). the problem is i've already seen it. i rented it from netflix in 2006 and rated it 3 stars . i guess it went out of print and then a new edition was made, but the rating i gave it in 2006 didn't transfer from that edition to this. i don't remember exactly why i gave it a lower rating. should i re-rate it 3 stars, in total disagreement with what netflix knows about me? or trust netflix? i feel bad for disagreeing with the netflix prediction of my rating, because they spent a million dollars to improve their recommendations. two things of note: i love bruno ganz, as an actor, and i rate every movie i've seen on netflix.com. i am thrilled to learn from a comment left here by ken, that leonard maltin's movie guide is now available on the iphone and ipod touch . i bought mine from the app store for $4.99, which is a third of what the book costs. the advantages of it over other applications is that you don't have to be connected to the internet to look up movie details. you get plot summaries, star ratings, cast and director. you can search the database by title, cast, or director to get filmographies. i do this all the time when i'm out with friends. we'll be talking about movies and they ask me what other movies has an actor been in? what other movies has someone directed? they think i'm the movie expert, and i keep them impressed by using leonard maltin's movie guide. another advantage is that you can create your own custom lists or add to favorites or movies to see which you can backup online. there's also a button to add movies to your netflix queue (requires an internet connection). i've been waiting for this ever since i gave up my palm t|x. a good movie guide was the only thing i missed about that palm. i left a note on leonard maltin's web site, asking that they make an app for the iphone. i reckon i wasn't the only one who wanted it. now my ipod touch is complete. if you don't have itunes or an iphone, check out the developer's web site for screenshots and more info. p.s. no one paid me or gave me anything to write this review. it's time again for the one month free trial cards from netflix. act fast, because these single-use codes are available on a first-come basis. they expire october 31, 2009. go to netflix.com/tellafriend and enter one of these codes: m216083727415 m256053727795 m226043727745 m246053727735 you are welcome to post your unused codes in the comments. fine print says: cannot be combined with any other offer. current and previous members and their households are ineligible. netflix will bill you at the completion of the free trial unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial. netflix is a month-to-month subscription that you can cancel at any time. no refunds or credits for partial monthly subscription periods. please visit netflix.com/termsofuse for complete fine print. netflix reserves the right to change terms and conditions any time they feel like it, and since i don't work for netflix, nor do i represent them, i have no right to speak for them, and you're at your own risk. you should check out their site and not take my word for it. 
Male: 90%, Female, the little copper tree and the wood on which it sits were sent to me by aleph. i added the birthday candle and the little figures (about 1/2 inch tall). this twisting tree reminded me of the wallace stevens poem on the road home. i tried something pretty simple with this- instead of blending bits of the three photographs i liked, i just stacked them, i think this reflects the mood of mutability in the poem.alice picks up the red king chesspiece, who does not know what force is lifting him through the air. feeling at the mercy of forces beyond our control frequently results in reverting to the primitive (did someone say reptilian brain?).
Female: 100%, Female,  14 x 5" about five years back, when i was just starting to paint, i emailed a well-known artist and asked him to take a look at my work and tell me what i was missing. he offered one comment that stuck with me - to pay as much attention to the edges as the content. i was too tight - too illustrative. and it's not what i wanted to achieve - i wanted to find the balance of details needed and leave the rest to impression. with each and every painting, i have to pay great attention to that fine line - not to say there are days when i desire to tighten up and other times i desire to really lay on the painterly strokes. i don't have a favorite feature in this new piece - i love all of it. that final dab of light blue on the bathing suit mattered, although i don't know what made me do it other than intuition. the edges are just as i want - allowing some to be rough and some soft. please click here for a larger view and purchase information. 12 x 12" front and center, on the third floor of the art institute, hangs gustave caillebotte's enormous painting 'paris street, rainy day' - certainly the biggest crowd-pleaser in the museum. there's plenty of room to not only get up close, but to back up a good 30 - 40 feet and take it all in. when i was a teenager, i would sit on the floor in front of this masterpiece and draw dozens of versions of parts of this urban scene - not knowing i'd paint it dozens of times thirty years later. my favorite feature of this new piece is the man on the far right, on his way out. i have wanted to add more movement in figures - a slight blur or even a ghost of a shape - just knowing when it's right is the tough part. and knowing how to get the idea across, without looking like my hand smudged the paint unintentionally is even harder. it's something i'm working on more and more, mostly behind the scenes. please click here for a larger view and purchase information. 16 x 16" this new painting is the largest piece in the show - done on a cradled masonite panel - and like the painting 'below the belt' , i added a paprika-like ground color on top of the black and let that vibrant, warm tone show through in many of the edges as well as the floor, which is what i love most about the end result. the two figures were wonderful to paint, especially the woman who has that great s-shaped posture. included front and center is georgia o'keeffe's 'black cross, new mexico', one of my all-time personal favorites in the art institute of chicago. please click here for a larger view and purchase information. 9 x 12" how about a moment of zen - forget the cold, wet, dreary weather outside and imagine yourself soaking up the warm sun on the beach all by yourself. and remember, brighter days are ahead. not soon enough - but it's coming. my first thought about this new painting is it can best be appreciated in person. the vibrancy of the skin tones, the yellow towel and especially the turquoise water and multi-blues sky - the texture and warmth in the sand, which i used a palette knife for most of that - yes, i wish i could hold up the real thing right in front of you. as with most paintings. in the process of painting this, i did the figure first, the water next, the people walking about and in the ocean way in the distance - and then wiped the whole thing off. those moments are funny - here i just spent hours on what i thought was nearly complete and it's as if my hand just took over and grabbed a rag and, in seconds, trashed it. so i sit there stunned for a minute, hearing that little voice that assures me it wasn't right and get over it. just as quick as it disappeared, i start it all over again - lessons learned - which usually makes the second attempt much more successful. now.... mix yourself a margarita and click here for a larger view and purchase information. 12 x 12" i may have said this before - when i'm in a museum, i find myself so focused on looking at people rather than the art. it's been an obsession since i was a kid - watching the human figure and studying how we move, stand, balance, sit ...... all of it. and when i start a painting, there's always something that stands out right away - a feature that is essentially why i'm interested in the photograph in the first place. in this case, i saw this gentleman and his clothes as one united, interesting form - i felt the weight of the fabric, the heavy load of the backpack and especially the zigzags created by the folds of the pants. i just love that feature. i also saw the warmth of the overall tones - the golds, reds, greys - and chose to paint a rich, paprika-like color on top of the black surface i usually start with and hoped it would peek through in parts as long as i didn't go too far and cover it all up. the challenge being to let the edges do what they do, without nit picking. like here in the legs ..... i was so happy with the some of the red showing through the creamy wall and the looseness of the shadows around the picasso - again allowing edges to overlap and disappear into each other. that's what i get when i stay away from small brushes - i'm forced to take more control of the strokes but i can't over-paint it. this young man was studying picasso's 'mother and child', which hangs in the modern wing in the art institute of chicago. please click here for a larger view and purchase information. booster seat i and ii each is 8 x 10" whew ! all of the new paintings are officially in the morris &amp; whiteside gallery , currently being hung for the three-artists-show opening friday, the 26th and i feel i can relax a little bit. and i'm very happy to start showing you each and every painting - and if you don't mind - i want to add to that some of my favorite details or 'sweet spots' that make them special. let me start with the paintings you see above - two women taking a rest on a bench in the art institute of chicago. it's where thousands of visitors take a load off and hopefully get a boost of energy to get back to exploring. now, you may recognize the woman on the right, i had painted her a few years back - but with this new piece, actually both paintings - i applied the oils with a palette knife, nice and thick, then carved into it with a brush, adding more detail and control. i can attest to this being more difficult and frustrating - but the challenge lies in moving the paint around, almost sculpting it in parts. some areas have slabs of color on top of color, like in the pants and the back wall and the swirling of thick paint to move with the folds of the clothes. you may also notice, even though i'm one of three artists in this show, i titled my work "the tute and a tan". let me explain how my brain works, with respect to getting the job done. i can move forward, fairly quick, if i have a specific direction. in this case, i chose to paint scenes from two of my favorite people-watching spots - the art institute of chicago aka the 'tute' - and the beach. once i can visualize a grouping that marries well with each other, i start working. there isn't an artist that doesn't get stuck not knowing what to paint next - and this way of thinking and preparing helps me motivate. all of my paintings in the show can be viewed here - and thank you for looking. a short video can be viewed here as well. hope you enjoy. 'cruise control' sold this might be a workshop meant for you - my second field expedition this year taking place november 1st - 5th at the arts center of coastal carolina on hilton head island in south carolina. i've seen the studio space, it's fabulous - and like the new york city workshop, we'll be painting in the early part of the day and photographing in the afternoons. i picked this location because it has provided me with loads of imagery for paintings - the beach, the low-country landscapes and savannah and charleston are near enough for a short road trip for more. also, the fine people at the morris &amp; whiteside gallery will be hosting an evening get-together at their gallery for our group and you may also be interested in scooting over to charleston after the workshop is over, for their palette and palate stroll during the weekend. should be great fun. more information can be found here and you can call vince fazio at the sedona arts center for further details and registration. 6 x 6" oil on masonite sold i am sure there's many of you out there that aren't embracing the snow right now. but remember, i live in the deep south, and this is not only a rare occurrence, it's an unusual opportunity for me to paint something different, and i love that. it is staggering to see my world blanketed in white - almost no hint of color anywhere - the muted, silver sky - the amazing quiet. if it wasn't for my slipping on the ice and dropping my camera right smack in the snow, i would say that day was a perfect day. i also get to play with thick, blended, warm and cool white paints - laid on thick and as heavy as the snow itself. so much fun. and i promise - the 18 new paintings you'll see in a few weeks will warm you up and remind you that brighter days are ahead. 
Male: 100%, Male,  (click for closeup) to launch the online magazine ekleksographia wave two: william blake and the mad tea party (edited by philip davenport), the artist sarah sanders performed an online writing event "for 24 hours from sunrise on monday 15th march through to the following sunrise on tuesday 16th march 2010." on her website, she wrote that "this is a one off event and no documentation will be made." actually, that's not quite true. i left the live video stream going for about an hour while i caught up on some online reading tonight, and i snapped a few screenshots of her writing in action. for the most part, nothing happened. sanders was nearing the end of a twenty-four hour marathon, and she must of been tired, so all i could see was a slight moundlike bit of paper, maybe a loose sheet, maybe bound into a book. i could tell that pencil marks had been made on it in lines, but little else. the wall behind it looked like the sky, so the still picture i saw seemed a landscape, of words. occasionally, though, sanders would appear on screen and begin some frantic scribbling onto that sheet of paper with a nub of a pencil. she was (and actually is) writing a sentences or sentences. syntax is flowing through her words, and i've enjoyed watching her write, watching the physical act of writing. and i'm happy to document this in this quite modest way, to remember a day of writing. just now, just before midnight (eastern daylight savings time), i watched her closely enough to read a short string of words. this is difficult to do because the camera is frozen in a closeup of the page when she writes, and she moves the paper violently back and force when she does. but i saw her write this string of words: "long till sunrise." she wonders, it seems, how long it is till sunrise, and she longs for it, because at sunrise she can sleep. she has about an hour and a half to go by my figuring. sleep well, sarah. ecr. l'inf. see a seen. a shape inviolate of wonder often has possi bilities unthought. numbers expressed are an orb extended. rays recall an orches tral set. the musician can do whatnot, exploring music. to restrict— district—them, a scattered cantata, a tested symbology, two beautiful songbirds are wrapped, caged, & freed, released to extension, allowed room, extrapola ting that value encompass ed via motions, thoughts, a simple cusp, intent of accident, stasis in glorious manifests, englobing, arousing, merged in, entirely one. that becoming, an ocean via duct: to 3, 4—counted, adding reality, intention, removing it, a subtlety. subtlety moving around, a way, to convince, to see . . . . fisher, finder, what fingers eradicate, and foreskin, just what oceans encompass: beach, reach, tense reaction to it. was i enraged by seven or seventeen ways?

(nevertheless enjoyment is a book of tiny prose poems that almost resemble the story of a woman's life, except that they represent, instead, merely brief moments and considerations in such a life. they hold together because of the tone of the language, their focus on the personal aspects of life (over the professional or even the poetic), and the feel of them. these are not necessarily sad poems, but they are restrained in their emotion. these are flashing fragments of stories that are occasionally somber yet always tinged with a sense or reality, something strangely missing from most poems i read these days. it seems to me that the best review i can ever provide is to list the lines and phrases that i find startling in a poem, but that is actually inadequate. it eviscerates the poems in any book, but it's particularly problematic with this one. elizabeth builds her poems through the accumulation of phrases. she doesn't write so much in sentences as in phrases, in wholes that might seem to be fragments of a thought. but this is the source of her poems' rhetorical power. these concatenated phrases sometimes propel the putative narrative forward and sometimes send it off course, set it askew, ask the reader to understand the inevitable surprise of life. for these are living poems about living life. geof huth reads selections from elizabeth bryant's (nevertheless enjoyment to understand these poems, and to hear them, i actually taped a few of them, trying to learn to speak in their serious and languid manner. as i did, i sometimes heard the failing of my inner ear to hear the rhythm and syntax of these poems, but also to hear their delicate beauty. for these are not showy poems at all. the language is simple, the syntax is straightforward, and it is the rhetoric of the poems that propels them forward. the poems make arguments about relationships, perception, living, and it is that sense of needing to speak out a life (though done almost totally drained of emotion) is what moves these poems forward. and one of the rhetorical tricks of these poems is to stop a poem in its tracks, to insert a phrase that makes us rethink the entire enterprise. i can't adequately express the beauty of these poems, not even by speaking them aloud to you, so let me add two more notes about these poems. first, each has a title that ends with a closing parenthesis even though it does not begin with and opening one. what this simple act of titling tells us is that the opening of the title of each poem is actually the title of the book itself, so the short poem "of a head smacked in afterthought)" is actually the end of a title that begins "(nevertheless enjoyment." this tells us a story, one possibly about loss, one about imperfection, about life. we are told that things might go wrong, but that still there is enjoyment in life, that our lives our guided by our ability to see that enjoyment. second, this is a visual book in one almost subtle way. this is actually a flipbook. because, as we read through the book, each subsequent poem is a step lower than the others on the page. the poem is a movement downwards, in terms of feeling. but in terms of poetry, this is a work of restrained beauty and depth. just the book we need. _____ bryant, elizabeth. (nevertheless enjoyment . quale press: np, 2010. ecr. l'inf at work this week, a single line in a single document four of us were working on transformed into a minor controversy that raged for a couple of days and pushed the completion of that tiny project off for just as long. afterwards, the person who had asked the question that set off this asked me how something so small could have such a great effect. my answer, as it always is, is that the smallest things matter most. for that reason, i'm glad that endwar has a new chapbook out from naissance at chapbookpublisher.com . endwar is a hyperminimalist poet, someone interested in the hugeness of the tiniest effects, someone interested in purity and the way in which language can be completely turned on its head by the movement of a single letter. these are poems for the hyperliterate as well, poems for people with a deep interest in the word and the word especially as a field of action for thought. (i do need to admit that i've "published" a few of these poems before both on this blog and via my tiny little micropress, dbqp, so my interest in this book and these poems is, in some way personal. and the personal continues, because a number of these poems closely resemble or are exactly identical to poems i've written, including a few poems in my recent book ntst . but these are only a few poems, because endwar's imagination is a bit different from mine, and it is in those poems, the ones i never could have imagined into existence myself, that i see his best work.) one of the best poems in this book, one reproduced on the publisher's website, and one uncharacteristically romantic is ( my hand remembers the shape of your hand ) working with the visual pun of the parenthesis as a hand, because he always works with the pun, endwar writes what seems to me one of the greatest love poems (if such a thing is possible) i've ever read, something delicate, human, and quietly beautiful, and something restrained, not a cry of joy or melancholy, merely a statement, bolstered by emotion that is hidden yet still real. many of these poems are great little pwoermds, instances of insight that come and go but that continue to resonate: everyhere eare rhthmh very few pwoermdists have this level of control, such surprising control of the dna of written language, this ability to produce meaning by the addition, subtraction, or repetition of a single language, but this is the way that endwar words, and carefully. he doesn't produce huge quantities of these tiny poems of his, but those he does are almost all surprisingly fresh and satisfying. a few of his poems are only a few words long a[tom b]bomb some are based on naming the punctuation marks the thorn , and none are more than a dozen words long, because endwar is not a narrator, not a storyteller. he is a creator of instants designed to awaken our minds and to make us see the world of words before us. without poets like endwar to show us the surprises of language that sit constantly before us, that language would be invisible to us, something that exists, that we might even use well, but something we would never see for itself. endwar deconstructs our entire system of written communication, and he does it by moving language around carefully, as a scientist might use a pipette to move the tiniest bit of animal matter to another spot on the same petri dish in order to see what changes would result. _____ endwar. open your i . naissance: np, 2009. us$10. ecr. l'inf. i watched twenty-two movies tonight, though (admittedly) at least one of them was under a minute long, and stan brakhage is certainly a poet with film, or was, and a couple of his films are clearly filmpoems. there is a reason that his brand of filmmaking was occasionally called the poetic cinema. his films are beautiful, personal, revelatory, and sometimes the smallest of them—certainly moth light , even the almost instantaneous eye myth —can shake you awake. tonight was a night that left little time for poetry, but what there was i took. i sat down on my couch with volume i of the collected poems of larry eigner , and i read a few dozen more pages into it. i’m going slowly, but i’m enjoying the instants of pleasure in his early work, where he’s trying to hone his craft, and sometimes only succeeding in writing a startling phrase, a perfect instant. it is always the instants that matter, the smallest bits of perceptible experience that matter. so i might wonder why i don’t worry much about margins. beneath my posting last night about larry eigner’s collected poems , john bloomberg-rissman asked me, did you see steven fama's post about this set? he's got serious problems with the way the edition’s laid out; he thinks it puts the lie to the editors' claims of fidelity. i believe 23 comments follow, some from curtis f, one of the editors. i wonder what you think of all this, from the visual poet's point of view? originally, i had begun to comment back to john, but my comment became too long to be a comment, so i’ve worked it into this: i read that posting, but not until today. i was a couple of entries behind on steven fama’s blog, which i have to say is always interesting, passionate, and full of good information. in the blog entry in question , steven argues that the editors of eigner’s collected (curtis faville and robert grenier) ruined eigner’s poems by printing them flush left instead of a few inches to the right of the margin, as eigner often did in his typescripts. he argued that eigner meant for the poems to be floating in white space and to do something else, as they had, ruined the integrity of the poems. i have to say steven is certainly correct, to a degree. i think most of the poems would look better floating in white space. and we could argue that that was eigner's intention. most of the time. but i’d say steven has exaggerated the issue. i had already scanned through the book by the time i'd read this, so i'd determined that no other good solution was possible. in eigner's later poems, especially, he tended to use more and more of the page, making the affordance of a three-inch left margin impossible if you wanted to maintain the textual interrelations of text within the poems themselves. for examples, see “starry figures,” iv:1598; “was will be,” iv:1612, and, most obviously, “there’s a season,” iv:1684-1685. with a three-inch margin on the left, these poems would be off the page or reformatted out of existence. these examples are not numerous, but they show that eigner had to drastically narrow the left-hand margin in some cases just to accommodate the poems, which argues that the wide left margin was not an essential characteristic of the poems but a convenience considering the general narrowness of his poems. (for instance, i tend to center individual poems of my own on a page, but if i lay them out into a book, i move them to some left-hand margin i define.) to me the left margin has no particular essence to it, because the essence is within the atomized cloud of words. the page is just the holder. most of eigner’s poems are not what i’d call visual poems, but they nearly are. they are what i call visualized poems, poems with a significant and important visual presence, but ones still focused on words over text. one solution to allow for three-inch-or-better margins would be to reduce the type size, but the type is already small enough. and their size replicates the size of eigner’s own type, allowing for a sense of how he put his word clouds together. (my argument, stretching this metaphor a bit, is that a beautiful cloud is itself, separably beautiful. it is not beautiful necessarily because of its placement in the sky.) another solution would be to start poems at different distances from the left-hand margin, which would be unsightly, a typographical mess. i’ve done this myself before, and it leads to visual chaos that doesn’t seem useful to me. so the only other solution i can think of would be to go to a landscape oriented page, which had nothing to do with how larry operated and which would require cutting individual poems across two pages, thus ruining the intentional mise en page of his usually one page or shorter poems. the decisions curtis faville and bob grenier made in this book seem to me to be the right ones. the decision about where to begin the poems is, simply, the only one. so, sure, the poems go pretty deep into the crevice of the left-hand margin, but this problem is obviated to some degree by the fact of the almost-constantly available white space on the facing verso page, which still gives the illusion of the poems floating in space. not as much, not as well, but as well as could be expected. what's most important in an eigner poem, typographically, is not the left-hand margin; it is the interrelations of the words in the typographic gridspace, and this is what these volumes maintain, going so far as to preserve every instance of double spaces between two words, though i remain unsure that these are always intentional and meaningful typographic instants. also, as the book itself demonstrates through reproductions of typescripts, eigner often squeezed multiple poems onto a page in a reasonably messy way. (see the cover of volume iv.) is this, then, meant to be an instruction to future editors to crowd those poems onto the page? i think not. and faville and grenier, in this instance, have pushed the fourth poem, reasonably, i'd say, onto the next page. if you look at eigner’s typescripts, you can see that most are messes of one kind or another, to one degree or another. they are workspaces. they are the workshop in which he created his poems, though not the poems themselves. the poems do not require the scribbled notations of eigner’s, the stuffing of extra poems onto the page, or even the common but not constant wide left-hand margins. even though i love those myself. i find it interesting that fama presents a reproduction of the final page of the book from the sustaining air as an example of how to do things. i'd say it is not. first, the poem really has no title besides its first line. that heavy title hanging over the poem (and essentially segregated from the poem because it is flush left while the poem is center-right), is awkward, unnecessary, and improperly capitalized. and the adherence to the extra-wide margin merely throws the poem awkwardly off-center on this narrower-than-letter-size page. this is all wrong, and this is early in eigner's career, before his visual effects became more fluid, and more essential. this is a pre-visualized poem, one of those that preceded eigner's real greatness (though this is a stunningly great poem and one of my favorites—maybe the title of my blog posting from last night gives that away. i wonder if the final versions of the poems developed by grenier and eigner together (their names, i'll note again, are almost anagrammatic, as if they were almost the same person) actually complied constantly to this three-inch-or-fatter margin. i doubt so, since it's just not possible for all the poems. but grenier could tell us. and grenier lived with eigner for quite a few years, so it’s likely he understood eigner better than those of us who know him only as words on a page. i've just started reading this book. it is four large volumes long, and i have much more to read, and i'm reading the entirety of the book in sequential order, so i'll pause occasionally through this experiment to record a few thoughts here, about the poems, about their development, about their visual effects, and about eigner as a visual or nearly-visual poet, of the first order. ecr. l’inf. every book, it now seems to me, is completely inconceivable to us until it lay in our hands. i have tried to use pictures to understand what the monstrous publishing project the collected poems of larry eigner really is, but they led me astray. the picture available anywhere shows the front cover, but only of the first volume of four—and each volume is illustrated with a different image, except that each image is of the same typescript of a single poem of eigner's. for the covers are the frames of a movie that moves in slow motion, as slowly as our eyes cross over the covers, as slowly as they recognize the repetition. the first frame is illustrated by two exploded words, two lines of text, "calligraphy/typewriters." if we know eigner, we know of his severe palsy, how he typed his poems for decades with one finger and one thumb with a typewriter, and we know that the typewriter is his way of writing. if we know eigner, we know that he worked his poems, slowly, methodically, across the field of the page, and we know that his poems were all about the mise en page, so we might guess how his determined typing was the only calligraphy he could have, that the machine itself and the invisible gridspace it worked upon were the fingers of his calligrapher's hand. the second frame pulls back—each frame pulls back a bit more from the last—to reveal what seems to be the opening of a poem, one of these telegraphic diagonals via which eigner learned to communicate. we begin with writing ("calligraphy/typewriters"), then move into an image of his hat (i pause here to announce, as i always do, that "huth" means "hat"), which is followed quickly by a "bureau" encased in parentheses. his hat, maybe, is within his bureau. and that is where, and in his writing ("calligraphy/typewriters") is where, and in his head (thus under his hat) is where "the world/inside/spins." when we pull back far enough to see the third frame, we see that this poem that we may have imagined continuing beyond "spins" has come to a stop, that that was the entire poem, something about writing and imagination, something about the life of the mind, maybe particularly the life of an agile man inside a crippled body, something possibly hopeful, even if a little disorienting. but we also see clearly now a little bit more. we see eigner's calligraphy. we see his crooked hand scrawling its way into and then out of a circle. we see that this is poem number 1117 and that it's from "jan 3 [19]79," that the poem would be published in orogrande , that eigner thought, in three lines of type, that the "first 2 lines might be / a good title for a col / lected poems." by the time we arrive at the fourth frame, we see the entire page with the poem, and we see that the poem we have been looking at is in the middle of the page, and that it is only one of four poems on that sheet. eigner's handwriting, which seems now relatively neat, heads every poem, providing the metadata we need to understand the poem: the poet's name, the date of composition, the sequential number, and the dotted lines that separate one poem deliberately from another. so i saw the covers and began reading this book of four books. it opens with the expected introductory matter, which shows robert grenier as someone attuned to both the look and the sound of eigner's poetry and a person writing only for himself, a purified poet writing introductions in a sometimes schematic way, in bursts of prose, set off by dashes and commas and parentheses, which, in the end, at least for me, communicates his excitement with the work. and the work begins early in eigner's career, with his juvenilia, starting when he was nine. the earliest poems show skill better than a nine-year-old should have but we have to read for years until eigner slowly begins to turn into himself. it's a beautiful process, like an unfolding, to watch how rectangles of text open up, poem by poem, year by year, until their words are freed to roam the page and make their sense as they will. i'm only on page 57 right now, but i'll continue to write about this book, from time to time, all the way through to co-editor curtis faville's essay at the end of the book, all the way to the index by amy grenier. this is a large reading project, but an essential one for me. early on, when i was barely a teenager, if that, eigner was important to me, the poet i couldn't escape. now, so many years in the future, i cannot even remember where or how i found eigner, or what of his i read, but i was already a visual poet, so already interested as words as physical objects on a page, so eigner was my poet, but he was also a poet, as these poems so clearly show. for many years, i didn't think of eigner, and i don't know how this happened, how i let him slip away, how i found in my library of thousands of books not a single book of eigner's, until a couple of years ago. but i'm returning home. we always do it, if only in our minds, because we cannot escape our origins. i'm not quite there, but in thirty pages i'll be to one of his famous poems, one that titled a book of his, "from the sustaining air," which is not that visual, but which has a beautiful sense of movement through the sense and sensing of the poem, and which ends with a line that really does seem to echo james wright, but which reverberates with its own throaty call: "i am, finally, an incompetent, after all" and thus we understand our hapless flailings in this world, and something of the beauty of them, the beauty of merely trying. _____ eigner, larry. the collected poems of larry eigner . edited by curtis faville and larry eigner. stanford university

Female: 100%, Female,  i plan to stop being a public, personal, storyteller. let me explain:&nbsp; i went to ted last month, which is a conference in long beach, and was asked to perform a 3 minute story in between speakers.&nbsp; i got up and told this story about mulan learning about sex for the first time.&nbsp; i call it the mulan-frog story (it begins with frogs…)&nbsp;&nbsp; it got big laughs and even a partial standing ovation at the end.&nbsp; people really loved it and i was so high and happy afterwards.&nbsp; i'm proud that i have the skill to tell a good story and make people laugh. i have a million happy memories of being onstage and making people laugh.&nbsp; there is always a dark side however.&nbsp; i am usually telling some story that could embarrass another person or i’m talking about something that irritates me about someone specific.&nbsp;&nbsp; when i got home from the conference i realized that if mulan saw my story (or a fellow student did) she could be very embarrassed.&nbsp; i was mortified and could not believe that i hadn’t considered this before.&nbsp; mulan looks good in the story – a curious, smart nine year old.&nbsp; but the whole topic is embarrassing to a girl her age.&nbsp; i was really struck deeply about what i do onstage and the fact that i have a child.&nbsp; i hated telling stories about my mother because i knew that it could be hurtful but i did it anyway because i loved getting the laugh, i loved getting to vent, and i felt i had the right somehow to talk about her onstage.&nbsp; i guess i thought there was some sort of unwritten code that made parents fair game.&nbsp; i actually feel that’s true and if mulan grows up and tells stories about me, no matter how unflattering, i will gladly accept that as her right.&nbsp; (i’ll be in the front row, no – wait!&nbsp; more lovingly, i will not be anywhere near the place!) but the other way around, me telling stories about her… that’s different. after much agonizing, little niggling things that i have hated for a long time about performing stories about my own life fulminated to the surface.&nbsp; i no longer wish to be so naked and bare.&nbsp; i am surprised i ever did want to do it.&nbsp; don’t get me wrong, i’m glad i did.&nbsp; i am proud that i learned to craft my experiences into a story and i am proud that i learned the craft of being on-stage.&nbsp; but now, i need to stop doing it.&nbsp; i am happily married, for one thing, and it’s boring and inappropriate to talk about.&nbsp; my daughter is ten and she reads my blog, (omg!) she goes to my shows.&nbsp;&nbsp; in fact we have spoken at length about the stories i tell about her.&nbsp;&nbsp; not that, at ten, she is really capable of understanding the ramifications.&nbsp; still, she says it’s okay to tell the mulan-frog story.&nbsp; but ugh.&nbsp;&nbsp; i don’t think she really understands.&nbsp; i feel the need to protect her from myself! in some ways, this is just another example of our internet age.&nbsp; when i started telling stories about my life, it was in a basement club in l.a. called luna park, in 1994, where the maximum capacity was 50 people.&nbsp; we were recording the shows, but it wasn’t for mass consumption.&nbsp; what i mean is that i could speak as if it were “off the record.”&nbsp; this lulled me into a sense of secrecy and intimacy and allowed me to say anything no matter how raw.&nbsp; i was uncensored. but, there is no more “off-the-record” anymore.&nbsp; anything can be posted online.&nbsp; immediately.&nbsp; i think this is, on balance, good – it makes people accountable in a new and direct way.&nbsp; but for me – well let’s just say i would probably never have begun telling stories about my personal life if i’d thought they could be available to any interested person, instantly.&nbsp; but once i started, i got used to the open-nature of talking about my life.&nbsp; i learned to live with the downsides, the embarrassment, possibly even when it hurt or embarrassed other people.&nbsp;&nbsp; then, when blogging came along, it seemed like such a natural thing to do.&nbsp; jill sobule and i have been working for a few years now doing a show together.&nbsp; i tell about ten to fourteen stories in our show.&nbsp; (she sings songs, i tell stories)&nbsp; we have worked hard to make the show work dramatically and musically. i think we’ve succeeded.&nbsp; in fact, i think our show is at least as good as any other show i’ve done, maybe better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i’m glad i tell all those stories in our show.&nbsp; but i don’t want to tell any more.&nbsp;&nbsp; the stories that are out there, well, they’re out there.&nbsp; but then… after this… well, i want to retire from it.&nbsp;&nbsp; at least for a while.&nbsp; maybe forever, i dunno. we have about 12 scheduled shows for this year (2010).&nbsp; mostly in the summertime and mostly in the northeast and the northwest.&nbsp;&nbsp; after talking this over with jill, we have agreed to do those shows.&nbsp; we may actually add a show or two.&nbsp; we may also find a way to film our show in the autumn.&nbsp; but by the end of this year, i plan to stop doing this show.&nbsp; and then face 2011 not performing. i haven’t written in my blog because i am always so suspicious of any type of big revelation or big announcement.&nbsp; i almost felt that if i announced that i was going to stop performing, there would inevitably be some reason not to stop it.&nbsp; i have mulled this over for the last month or so.&nbsp; and it feels good.&nbsp; it feels right. sometimes i feel that my creativity, (and not just mine, but everyone’s creativity) is like the snow on a mountaintop melting a little at a time.&nbsp; all my various outlets – performing and writing in all its manifestations -- create little rivers through which the snow can melt.&nbsp; i always liked having so many things going at once.&nbsp; i always felt that in show business, you had to have five pots on the stove just to get one of them to boil.&nbsp; i benefited from being so multi-able.&nbsp; i could do voice over and then perform at a club, i could write a monologue and then write a pilot for a tv show.&nbsp; but lately it feels that i have fragmented my focus with this policy.&nbsp; i want the snow to melt into a couple of larger rivers, not into several smaller streams.&nbsp; and so, after the ted experience, i found myself wondering what i’m doing with myself.&nbsp; how am i directing my energies?&nbsp; i began to look at the darker side of telling stories about my personal life.&nbsp; the guilt, the anguish, the desire to emphasize this over that, the slant, the small or large exaggeration, the worry that someone i’m talking about will see or hear me.&nbsp;&nbsp; then i suppose you could say the tipping point was mulan. also, many things have changed.&nbsp; i am now more able to be isolated (having moved to the midwest from los angeles) and conversely, i am now in more regular and intimate interdependence with people.&nbsp; i guess what i mean is that i have a husband and a child.&nbsp;&nbsp; there is already a lot of interaction in my life, and i have begun to crave more and more alone time.&nbsp; i desire privacy.&nbsp; i don’t want my personality to be so known anymore.&nbsp; (my personality has been so slutty!&nbsp; time to join a convent!) so, in the last few weeks i have beta-tested my new views.&nbsp; and it’s already had such forceful and creative results.&nbsp; i am focusing on a couple of screenplays; with my writing partner jim emerson.&nbsp;&nbsp; i may or may not finish writing the memoir of my letting go of god time, “my beautiful loss-of-faith story.”&nbsp; of course, i’ll do the jill &amp; julia shows with jill sobule during this year.&nbsp; then i plan to hang up my mouth.&nbsp; i can see jill and i doing another show, someday, but not until way into the future.&nbsp; (if she wants to!) (in ten years!)&nbsp; i do honestly have that fantasy.&nbsp; or i can imagine that i will change in a few yea rs time and want to get back up on stage.&nbsp; or maybe i will develop the skills to talk about things that aren’t so personal and private, like many other comics do.&nbsp; that could happen.&nbsp; but i doubt it.&nbsp; and at the very least, i doubt it for the foreseeable future. anyway, here i am making a big pronouncement, just what i didn’t want to do.&nbsp; i’m trying to write this in a way that appears that i’m mindful of the unpredictable events that could occur.&nbsp; but insofar as i can plan ahead, and insofar as i can predict my attitude, and insofar as i have the ability to point myself towards one thing over another, i feel the plan to stop talking about myself publicly is right. so, this means that i won’t be blogging about my family.&nbsp; or really blogging at all. i am so thankful for all the people who have read my blog and commented.&nbsp; please, if you can, come to see one of the jill &amp; julia shows this year.&nbsp; for me, this show is so meaningful; it’s an end of an era.&nbsp;&nbsp; for 16 years i have been getting on stage and spilling my guts while simultaneously attempting to make people laugh.&nbsp; that’s a long time.&nbsp; this decision feels like a death.&nbsp; it’s hard to envision myself as myself without the outlet and the drive to get onstage and talk about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; on the other hand, it doesn’t seem right to continue either.&nbsp; this decision feels inevitable and yet surprising and mostly very, very right.&nbsp; i’m so excited about this, to be honest.&nbsp;&nbsp; imagine me, a private person!&nbsp; (i recently joked with jim emerson about how i feel i was a butterfly but i’m morphing into a caterpillar!) i’ll be posting all the places where jill and i have booked shows very soon.&nbsp; thanks for reading. botanic gardens, kauai hawaii i took this pic a few years ago when mulan and i spent christmas with friends in kauai. i've been thinking about voltaire a bit. &nbsp; in our last writing session, jim reminded me of the poem that voltaire wrote after the lisbon earthquake of 1755 when all the priests were railing against the people themselves for being the culprit. &nbsp;the disaster occurred because of their sinfulness. &nbsp;and now, 255 years later and we still have the like of pat robertson and his voodoo/pact-with-the-devil/christian belief that haiti brought all this on itself. here is voltaire's poem:&nbsp; poem on the lisbon disaster - wikisource and here is a good excerpt: what crime, what sin, had those young hearts conceived that lie, bleeding and torn, on mother's breast? did fallen lisbon deeper drink of vice than london, paris, or sunlit madrid? in these men dance; at lisbon yawns the abyss. tranquil spectators of your brothers' wreck, unmoved by this repellent dance of death, who calmly seek the reason of such storms, let them but lash your own security; your tears will mingle freely with the flood. pat robertson is an anomaly now. &nbsp;the public is ridiculing him. &nbsp;this makes me optimistic. &nbsp;in voltaire's time it the catholic church was everywhere and this was the general attitude. i really think things are changing. &nbsp;slowly.&nbsp; what shocks me is that while the mainstream may mock robertson, they don't seem to take it a step further. &nbsp;if god didn't cause the earthquake then does god cause anything? is he a sad bystander? &nbsp;is he able to do anything about it? &nbsp;of course not. &nbsp;then why believe in any god at all? &nbsp;but no one takes it that far. &nbsp;it's pc to extoll the belief that god is there to rely on, you can cry on his shoulder, you can ask for strength. &nbsp; why is that so acceptable? &nbsp;&nbsp; and why did the font on my blog just change? &nbsp;oh! &nbsp;i cannot stop and noodle with it, i have dinner to prepare. val, my cat, on my desk here is an experimental blog post - a straight-up diary of my day. so... this was my day... got up, nudged mulan along as she groggily got dressed for school. &nbsp; got her breakfast and made some coffee. &nbsp;helped her look through her homework to make sure everything was done. &nbsp;nudged her to finish a math page and a bonus challenge homework page. &nbsp;gave her a pre-test for her spelling quiz. &nbsp;nudged her to get her teeth brushed and especially to floss. after she left i took the dog, arden on a walk to lake michigan. &nbsp;i listened on my iphone to an audio biography about paul durac, a british theoretical physicist. &nbsp;i am convinced he had asperger syndrome only the biographer doesn't mention that. &nbsp;i get jelous of dirac's life where everything is arranged so he can work constantly, i wish i had a mancy (his wife's name) who made sure i was undisturbed, had food, and could take long walks. &nbsp;today as i walk it's very deceptively icy. the sidewalks look clear but they have the thinnest layer of ice. i almost fall down a hundred times. &nbsp;i don't like the cold today. &nbsp; the lake is sad looking, a lot of dirty looking piled up snow on the edge of the lake. i look closer and see that what i thought was dirt is really sand. &nbsp;i marvel at lake michigan and all it's sand. get home and michael is completely absorbed in some lighting project at the house. &nbsp;he is a man obsessed with lighting. &nbsp;he wants to program every single light in our house so that we can stand at the door and push one button and every light we don't want on will go off. this requires a lot of work, hooking up this outlet but not that one, etc. &nbsp;he is frustrated with the software for the program and it's the third incarnation of this software he has worked with. he has been up for two nights until at least one or two a.m. working on the lighting project. &nbsp;i kid with him and say, when he gets it done i expect him to say with glee, "now all you have to do to turn down the lights in the family room is log onto this website on your computer, enter a certain number, and the light will automatically dim!" &nbsp;he does not like my joke because you see, it's not really a joke. i leave and go get a mammogram. i have not had one for a few years. i, having had cervical cancer, should be more vigilant, but i have let things go. &nbsp;i get to the evanston medical center and read the book i am completely absorbed in. "lacuna" by barbara kingsolver. &nbsp;it's such a great book, a fictionalized account of a young mexican american in the thirties who befriends frida kahlo and diego rivera and trotsky. &nbsp; i am pulled out of my reverie by a stern woman asking me to put on a gown. &nbsp;the gown is awkwardly configured so even after you tie it in the places it wants to be tied, you have to hold it closed otherwise your whole front shows as you walk down the hallway to the mammogram machine. &nbsp;the woman inside is friendly and i'm thankful for her warm hands as she manipulates my breasts this way and that. &nbsp;i think about what a weird job she has. &nbsp;i wonder if she says to people, "i just sort of fell into it." &nbsp;there is no hidden meaning in that configuration of words, i just wonder if that's the phrase she'd use. as i leave we discuss the gowns. &nbsp;she agrees, they suck. i leave and take a moment to consider that i could get a bad response on my mammogram and have cancer. i fantasize what i would do if i learned i had only one year to live. &nbsp;i decide that i would just go places to look at animals and nature and the sky at night. &nbsp;i would go to the galapagos, or hawaii and just sit and watch. i don't need to see any more people, i've seen big cities, but i've done it. &nbsp;i get it. &nbsp;big vibrant city. &nbsp;i crave quiet and nature without people. &nbsp;i decide that i would have to pull mulan out of school to go with me to hawaii or the galapagos. &nbsp;of course michael would have to come, he'd have to shut down his business and come. &nbsp;jill sobule would have to come too, as well as jim emerson. &nbsp;i guess there'd be some people. &nbsp; then i think, it would be bad for mulan to be pulled out of school right now because &nbsp;she is really doing well and loves her school. &nbsp;then i remember this is all a fantasy. &nbsp;i blink back tears and come back to life. i go to my favorite bread store in evanston. &nbsp;it's friday and i get challah. &nbsp; i don't ask for challah bread . &nbsp;i used to do that. &nbsp;then michael told me that was like asking for guinness beer. &nbsp;you just say guinness, not guinness beer, just as you just say challah. &nbsp;we like to buy challah for french toast on sundays. &nbsp; i don't have mulan with me but i remember while i'm at this store that this was where mulan made her first decent pun. &nbsp;she said they should put a sign out on fridays saying, "celebrate, it's challah-day!" &nbsp; while i'm at the bread store i also get a turkey sandwich on their popeye bread. &nbsp;it's so good, it's worth all the points. i come home and eat my sandwich while i watch some tv footage about haiti. i get really upset. &nbsp;i start to cry. &nbsp;it all seems so hopeless. &nbsp;what if you were stuck and had so much time before you died to know it was going to happen? &nbsp;or worse, you didn't know if your loved ones were okay or not. &nbsp;or even what just really happened out there. &nbsp;this is happening to someone right now. &nbsp;this makes my heart heave. i answer a few phone calls. &nbsp;i speak with a woman at minnesota public radio about doing a show at the fitzgerald theater in st. paul in march. &nbsp;it seems like it's going to happen. &nbsp;then i do some business paperwork, for example, i send $1000 to sony for the rights to sing "is that all there is" in "letting go of god" for one year. then i try to write. &nbsp;i decide my book of essays is not as important as "my beautiful loss of faith story" the book i've been working on for years. i wonder if i can reach my goal of finishing it this year. i wonder how many years i've had this goal. i feel depressed. &nbsp;i remember we have no food in the house and mulan is bringing a friend home after school. &nbsp; i go to the grocery store. &nbsp;i buy chicken noodle soup and oyster crackers for mu and her friend to have after school. &nbsp;this is mu's big tv day. &nbsp;she cannot watch any tv during the week, but on friday after school it's a tv free-for-all. &nbsp;i also buy vegetables and after i come home, i quickly make a pasta sauce in the slow cooker. i run to meet mu after school, but i am a few minutes late and she is nearly home and i end up meeting her half way. she has her friend with her. mu got 100% on her spelling quiz and i am elated. &nbsp;i heat up the chicken soup for them. &nbsp;nadia comes over to watch the girls because i have a hair appt. &nbsp;michael has gone to work. &nbsp;i get my hair cut really short. i really look like a nun now. and i like it. &nbsp;i feel i am in "a nun's story" as i leave the hair salon. &nbsp;i tell myself that if my hair is going to be this short i really have to remember to wear lipstick. &nbsp;i love my hair dresser. &nbsp;she gets my hair. i come home from the salon and michael is already home and working on his lighting project again. mulan is upstairs in our room watching tv. &nbsp;i make everyone eat the pasta and sauce. &nbsp;it's only okay, not great. &nbsp; &nbsp;i beg everyone to watch the netflix movie i have, "winged migration." &nbsp;i already saw it when it came out (in 2000) but it was so great - all about various birds' migrations across the earth. &nbsp;michael wants to work on the lighting project, mulan wants to watch icarly, they don't want to watch it. &nbsp;i'm too tired to do anything useful. &nbsp;i briefly decide to go read my book in the basement, but then rally and force everyone to stop what they're doing and watch "winged migration." &nbsp;i really have to push. &nbsp;i momentarily hate everyone and wonder why i'm doing this. &nbsp; i think that if i'm going to die in a year i really must finish the screenplay that jim emerson and i are working on. we are having so much fun. &nbsp;working with jim has been one of my life's great joys. &nbsp;just as i'm giving up on mu and michael they agree, yes, let's watch the movie together. &nbsp;i suddenly feel a huge surge of love for them. before we watch the movie, we make popcorn in the microwave. &nbsp;michael has experimented and experimented and if you take 1/4 cup of popcorn and a dab of oil and put it in a kid's paper lunch bag and staple the top, zap it for exactly 2 minutes, it turns out great. we watch. &nbsp;michael loves the film but is skeptical about how much they doctored itto get certain types of shots. &nbsp;mulan is rapt with the film, and so is arden - it's the first time my dog watched most of a movie. &nbsp;but when it's over mulan announces she's thrilled she's now let out of this horrible prison i've put her in, forcing her to watch this movie. &nbsp;also, she announces that she will never eat a bird. ohmygod, i love my family so much. mulan goes to her room, michael goes back to the lighting project, and i come in here and write about my day. snow, snow, everywhere... and i love it. wow. &nbsp;all those posts to the last blog entry have my head in constant conversation. &nbsp; i think the post that i've thought about the most was the one which indicated i was breaking the question down in a poor way. &nbsp;(well, there were many posts pointing that out...) &nbsp;this one broke down the debate in a different way - between religion with supernatural claims and religion without supernatural claims. &nbsp; that is true. &nbsp;i guess i don't normally think of or remember that there are religions without supernatural claims. buddhism is the only one i can think of. (not all sects of buddhism.) &nbsp; or the unitarian church. to me, religion works best as a ritual keeper and community builder. &nbsp;these things are very important. &nbsp;in my observations - which are mostly about my upbringing in spokane in the catholic church and then watching my friends who have stayed in the church - the best thing they get from their religion is the shared rituals and community. &nbsp; these are the things that i really craved, in retrospect. &nbsp;i had mouthed the words and didn't think all that much about the readings, i liked bach and the candles and the idea that i had stood in this same church year in and year out on one particular day that earmarked the dead of winter or the beginning of spring - saying the same things, hearing the same songs, watching kids grow up, flirting with boys, seeing who was getting married, mourning those who had died. &nbsp;all those things can be a part of a life without the supernatural. on the other hand, the supernatural specifics of what we were all supposed to believe were, in my opinion, &nbsp;a great hindrance to the development of a skeptical outlook and even general critical thinking skills. &nbsp;so, the ideas we were so benignly taught had an insidious price. &nbsp;we paid with our critical minds. &nbsp;some of my friends from spokane, for example, have - in my humble opinion - undeveloped political opinions. &nbsp;worse, they back off from any debate. &nbsp;they make ad homonym attacks. &nbsp;tragically, some of them have no understanding of the tenants of other faiths, and even of their own faith. &nbsp;sometimes it seems that they are even proud of their lack of information. &nbsp;is the church to blame? &nbsp;hmmm... i kinda think so. &nbsp;i hate to say, i do. but the rituals and community continue to give. &nbsp;and i can see that it is a great value. i think the unitarian church can offer this, but not at the cost of your critical mind. but for me, i do not feel in need of the community anymore! &nbsp;i like the idea of it, but not the practicality of it. &nbsp;it involves a great deal of socializing and i feel that i am filled up with that. what i crave now, (and i am fifty, so maybe this is a natural thing to happen,) but i want less socializing and social obligation in my life. &nbsp;i crave quiet and contemplation. &nbsp;i want to learn. &nbsp;i feel i am hungry to learn and read and think, &nbsp;well, it's almost as if i had scurvy and were in need of an orange! &nbsp;and true learning and thinking take a lot of time and quiet. &nbsp;with a husband and a child, as well as a few very close friends, &nbsp;i feel i am up to my ears in interaction with people. &nbsp;adding a church would put me over the edge. &nbsp;even if mulan may benefit from it, she would have an even more frazzled mother and i don't think that is good. ( i could just see myself getting caught up in it at first, volunteering for five committees, nodding "yes!" to the bake sale, and then being in the worst possible mood about it all for the next six months... &nbsp;wait! this is what being at a public school is like already! &nbsp;i've so far been able to back away from most things... &nbsp;but yes, i feel guilty about it. &nbsp;guilty or angry? that's always my dilemma... ) i think me and my friends would have been better served by a church that did not subscribe to supernatural beliefs. &nbsp;we would have gotten the ritual and community but not the inanity. but sometimes i wonder, would we stick to it if it didn't have a whiff of a real god on high? &nbsp; i might not have. &nbsp;it would require inculcating me about the need of community and social obligation and not about someone looking over my shoulder who could see everything. ...i wrote the above jumbled blog entry this morning and was intending all day to get back to it, reread all those wonderful posts from the last entry and rewrite it. but now it's late, and i have to fly to new york in the morning. &nbsp;so i'm just going to throw this out there. it's woefully inadequate in it's musings upon this topic. jill sobule and i are doing a show on sunday night at joe's pub in new york and it's sold out. that is really exciting!!!! bahai temple, wilmette, il &nbsp;early christmas morning 2009 i took this picture early this morning on my dog walk. mulan, michael and i opened presents, had breakfast, and then flew to l.a. &nbsp;now i am here, and i realize how much i miss it! &nbsp;yippity yah, five days in l.a. not much to report, but i wrote this (below) last week and i guess i'll paste it here now... amongst the non-believers of this world, there appears to be a split in thinking between: 1.) those that think religion is good - regardless of truth - for some people. &nbsp;religion is useful for those who are trying to get sober, for those who have no where to turn, for those that might not follow society's rules, for those who might not otherwise respect others, for those in complete despair, and for those that need the idea, the concept - as a new drug - to get off another one. 2.) those who think religion and the idea of god is never good for anyone. i have always put myself in the #1 category. &nbsp; it suits me because i don't want to proclaim that seeing stark reality, which is very dark and full of potential catastrophe, is good, or possible for everyone. but this thinking is very condescending. &nbsp;it's plato saying religion is good for the masses. &nbsp;it's will durant saying how religion helps to bind people together, and so for society it's good. &nbsp;it's aa using the idea of a higher power to get people to let go of another, actual drug. but #2 is so arrogant too. i mean this is all just for the rumination - religion and the idea of god is not going away and most likely never will - so this is all just blathering about the number of angels who can dance on the head of a pin . &nbsp;i have always stayed away from the #2 thinking because it puts me in a position of dismissing so much in others. i am not comfortable with it. &nbsp;it's very judgey. &nbsp;of course, that is no way to decide what you think. &nbsp;being&nbsp; judgey &nbsp;is the point of this whole debate! but in my private thoughts, what do i really think? &nbsp;it's like a little debate between plato and voltaire. &nbsp;plato did think religion was good for the masses. &nbsp;voltaire believed religion enslaved people. truthfully, now i'm beginning to lean towards voltaire. i asked my husband yesterday if he thought religion did any person any good at all. &nbsp; "think about anne lamott, a nice, liberal, happy christian, " i said, &nbsp;"or people who get off drugs and alcohol because they find jesus. &nbsp;i mean, aren't we all better off because of that transfer of the more dangerous drug to the more benign one?" and he said, "maybe. but now those people are primed to follow. &nbsp;jesus might be the idea for now, but it really could be anyone. they have made themselves programmable and basically they are sheep and now anyone could lead them - it could be to the top of a mountain or it could be off a cliff." again, i am paraphrasing and adding imagery for emphasis. &nbsp;and may i remind you that i do not hang on this guy's every word, far from it! but i thought about that all day. &nbsp;i mean, i have always thought #1 was the benevolent point of view, the humble point of view, the less-judgemental and superior point of view, but actually that is wrong!! the #1 thinking is really so cynical and superior and #2 has all this faith &nbsp;in everyone to use rationality and critical thinking to get through. &nbsp; #2 is actually the humble - or no, the optimistic point of view! &nbsp;(not that being humble or optimistic is some sort of proof for an argument!) &nbsp;but you know, neither of these words is right, it's more like empowering - it's the empowering point of view. i have not really come to any conclusions about this. &nbsp;but i'm just realizing how there is this split in thinking and i'm not sure - i vacillate between those views. arden, in the backseat of the just-bought mini-van, as we drove from los angeles to chicago, embarking a year ago today, dec. 17, 2008. a year ago mulan and i, after watching a moving company depart with all of our possessions, joined michael as we drove together from california to illinois. &nbsp;there was a huge storm which prevented us from taking the route we wished to take - through santa fe and instead we drove south, through arizona and then texas. &nbsp;it took four days. &nbsp;we had a dog in the car who wanted to kill, really truly kill and eat, the cat in the car. &nbsp;we stopped at motel 6s, we saw billboards in texas that proclaimed that obama was not born in the u.s., we watched arden pee in ice for the first time. &nbsp;it was an adventure. we arrived here just before christmas, slept in our new house all together on sleeping bags in the master bedroom, and wandered our neighborhood thinking, "what the hell did we just do?" and what have i done this year? &nbsp; adjust, be a mom who's around a lot, do a few shows, write a pilot, and empty a bunch of boxes. &nbsp;the house is still not totally organized - the basement is on it's way... &nbsp;but i am much happier here and thrilled to be in this new family. &nbsp;it really does feel like a family. &nbsp;mulan can barely remember life before michael. &nbsp;last night we talked about the drive. &nbsp;for mulan, this was our biggest adventure of all. &nbsp;she often refers to the drive and wants to do it again - with the cat and the dog. (that part was not so much fun for me.) anyway, as i have not taken a picture the last couple of days, i thought i'd throw up that one of arden, a year ago, on his way to his own new adventure here. what am i thinking about? &nbsp;well, i am very sad about the healthcare "overhaul." &nbsp;i am very sad about obama and i am wondering if he is really who i thought he was. &nbsp;i read robert reich's and glenn greenwald's articles on salon and i am just really so sad, and so disappointed, and i wish they would not vote for this deal and i like howard dean even more than i ever have and i hate joe leiberman, even though this demise is not all his doing. (last night i overheard mulan telling michael, "mom was in the car driving and yelling, 'that joe leiberman!' and her fists were clenched.") anyway, let's change the subject. &nbsp;what other things am i thinking about? i am thinking about all the letters i have gotten from people and how much they mean to me. i want to write back everyone, and i hope to send at least a thank you. &nbsp;i am trying to just be present and take it all in. i am thinking about some of the questions that people have asked. &nbsp;some people worry about having meaning in a world without god in it. &nbsp;i don't have the best answer for that yet (i am mulling on that one) but i remember once being at a convention with
Female: 100%, Female, male yellowhammer, hatched last yearmale goldfinch, also hatched last yearbeen ringing again, this time on our monthly visit to beeston. it was really too windy to be very productive, but we did catch the first yellowhammer for quite some time, an array of greenfinches and chaffinches, and a goldfinch.yesterday, we were very close to catching a sparrowhawk, but by the time we'd legged it to the net, it had got out and flown off.to make up for the disappointment, we caught three long-tailed tits. two of them had consecutive ring numbers - they were the same two we'd caught together at dusk the previous month! everyone say 'ahhhhh'...i've been so busy lately that i've barely had any time for photos during the week, and i haven't managed much at weekends either. hopefully normal service will soon be resumed. highlights in the garden have been up to 15 reed buntings and four yellowhammers. no sign of newts in the pond yet, though there have been a few backswimmers and lesser diving beetles pootling around.photos taken with canon eos 30d

Male: 100%, Female, the world health organization said the swine flu does not appear to be spreading in a significant way. mexican health officials have lowered its suspected death toll by 75 people, which indicates the disease is not as widespread or dangerous as originally suspected.  so far, cases of the swine flu outside of mexico haven't been as severe. at this point 18 countries have reported outbreaks of the disease and significant measures have been taken in each to prevent further contamination.  overall, initial concerns and predictions haven't been substantiated .  originally reported by the bbc .  scars are a part of life, but not for much longer. scientists have discovered a drug that reduces the appearance of surgical scars.  scaring is prevented when the compound, avotemin, is injected into the skin around a surgical incision before and after a surgery. avotemin works to send signals between cells so the body's collagen knits more effectively, which reduces scars.  with more research the compound may result in an anti-scaring treatment. even thought the drug is only cosmetic it can help people feel better about themselves - always a good thing. no one wants to be reminded of their injuries and illnesses.  originally reported by daily mail.   a recent study on sperm may result in a win for everyone. researchers discovered a gene mutation that causes infertility and the discovery may lead to  a cure. the discovery may also lead to the development of a male contraceptive pill. in just one study two issues may be addressed.  the researchers were initially trying to isolate genetic causes of deafness, but instead found two different dna mutations in the catsper 1 gene that effected a man's ability to produce a protein related to sperm "hyperactivity," or sperms ability to move fast enough to penetrate a female egg. it is possible that antibodies could be developed that could bind to the defective protein thus creating healthy, active sperm. additionally, the mutation would be selectively applied in pill form and create a male birth control pill. both applications need more research and development. nevertheless - there's hope for those who and don't want children.  originally reported by the bbc .  seeing is believing and a 73-year-old man that lost his eyesight thirty years ago can now believe - his sight is back. with the help of a bionic eye, ron can now track light and make out basic shapes. he says he can short socks for the first time in thirty years.   ron's experimental surgery took place at london's moorfield's eye hospital. a tiny camera mounted on a pair of sunglasses transmits data via a cable to electrodes that sit upon ron's retinas. when the electrodes are stimulated they transmit messages to the optic nerve in ron's brain, which in turn allows him to see the light pattern experienced by the camera.  with training, patients will be able to create meaningful images based on the light patterns they can now see. to date, eighteen people have bionic eyes and more will follow.  originally reported by the bbc.   half a million people with severe asthma now have an effective treatment.  two groups of researchers from the uk and canada found injections of mepolizumab , an antibody, help reduce the frequency of severe attacks in people with asthma exacerbated. aside from decreasing the number of attacks, the treatment also allows asthma patients to decrease their use of steroids, which have multiple negative side effects like weight gain and bone loss.  this type of asthma is linked to abnormally high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils . the antibody injections bring the white blood cell count down and that prevents the server airway inflammation associated with asthma.  the treatment reduces attacks by up to 50 percent and increases the quality of life for asthma sufferers .  originally reported by the bbc .  learning about endangered species is no easy task. the saharan cheetah falls into this category and is rarely seen - until now. a team from the zoological society of london has captured several images of the endangered animal. the images help identify individual animals and provide information about the allusive species, which little is know about.  with fewer than 250 mature individuals in the wild, the saharan cheetah faces extinction. by gathering images of the animals that roam just six countries (algeria, togo, niger, mali, benin, and burkina faso), zoologists hope to understand the animals' movement and ecology. this information may help save the species.  if nothing else, the images provide another face to a problem humans love to ignore - endangered species.  originally reported by the bbc.  photo by farid belbachir of the zoological society of london.    an allergy to peanuts is no joke. for some, just smelling peanuts can result in a fatal reaction. which makes finding a cure all the more important and useful. a team from cambridge's addenbrooke's hospital may have done just that. the team effectively cured four children of their peanut allergy.  over the course of six mouths, the team gave the children larger and larger exposures to peanuts to build up their bodies' tolerance to the nut. by the end of the six month period the children could eat five peanuts a day and have no reaction. this is the first food allergy to be mitigated by exposure.  even though more testing needs to be done on the method, it does give people with the debilitating allergy hope. people with peanut allergies agonize over food products and often can't eat in certain restaurants because of the allergy.  if the allergy is curable that means improved quality of life. (it also means airlines might start serving peanuts again. here's hoping.)  originally reported by the bbc .  we've all done it - forgotten to charge our phone then appealed to a friend for theirs, but of course they have a different brand of phone so their charger won't work. this annoying scenario will be a thing of the past.  the major phone companies - nokia, motorola, samsung, sony ericsson, lg, t-mobile, orange, 3, at&amp;t and vodafone - have agreed to come together and create a universal phone charger that can be used with any handset model. the majority of phones will support the new charger by 2012.  additionally, the charger will be environmentally friendly and consume 50 percent less stand-by energy compared to today's chargers.   let's give props to the major phone companies for thinking about their customers and how they can make our lives easier. it's also impressive that they would make the charger use less energy. too bad the iphone isn't included!  originally reported by the bbc .  
Female: 100%, Female, well, i made it to fairbanks. it's a beautiful first day of spring, sunny and warm - 33 degrees. downright tropical in this part of the world. i haven't been to this region of alaska in nearly seven years; i'm actually surprised how much of it feels familiar to me. we had a great trip up, traveling overland - the only way to travel. we took the ferry to skagway and chugged up white pass in my friend bjorn's old subaru (crossing our fingers the entire way). we visited friends in whitehorse and continued north on the alaska highway to kluane lake, where we geared up for an overnight "ski" trip (i was on snowshoes) in the frigid mountains of the yukon.
Female: 100%, Female,  :: nesting newbies :: :: destined to design :: :: the drifter and the gypsy :: :: sweet fine day :: :: yatzer :: ok so here's the real deal, i am obsessed with my blogroll! ok, not the literal roll but the incredible blogs listed on it! and not because i think they are great but because i think they are great and i enjoy them, i am inspired by them and i happily follow them daily. my blogroll is not just a place to share what i love to read with you lovelies but a place for me to actually sort out what i love to read. i have a little method - i bookmark inspiring blogs and sites and then update my blogroll every few months so i don't lose them in my - what i thought was a streamlined - bookmarking system. i realized a few weeks ago that all of my bookmark folders have, oh, tons and tons of sites marked and i can (sadly) lose track of what i actually bookmarked to enjoy. i just updated my blogroll ( now over 165 sweet blogs and sites ) with a bunch of new fab additions and wanted to share a few with you - they are lovely!! enjoy, support, love and inspire. nesting newbies :: new online lifestyle magazine run by two amazing women with a spread of food, entertaining, home design and more. and the online mag has streaming video in the articles - super creative. destined to design :: an la gal that is inspired everyday and shares it through her lovely blog. the drifter and the gypsy :: the sweet micaela's blog is full of design, photography and cool words. she also happens to be a recent blog out loud panelist . sweet fine day :: an owner of a confectionery's blog?! yes! sweet, pretty and lovely photos to boot. yatzer :: my new fave innovative and eclectic "finger on the pulse" design mag that curates cool stuff. :: all images from their respective blogs :: last week at blog out loud 5 , one of the lovely items in our goodie bags were cookies, generously donated from sweet ambs . ok, people, these cookies are -seriously- gorgeous! i felt bad eating it (but i did :) i especially love the cameo cookie and was inspired to pull another banquette seating image, one of my fave small space ideas. spring is almost here and i am so excited for sunny long days and san francisco fun! :: cookies by sweet ambs and kitchen by decorpad :: it's such a pretty day in san francisco today and spring is on it's way! i have been thinking about coral and white - clean, romantic colors that feel good all the time. i love this striped pillow from williams-sonoma home. changing out your throw pillow covers is an easy and affordable way to change the entire vibe of your small space.&nbsp; many of us have family heirlooms and fond knick knacks in our small spaces. i definitely believe in creating a home with items that make you feel good! another way to create a vibe is to include furniture and decor that sparks inspiration. i am loving these colorful side tables with vintage cigar vignettes. they remind me of an outdoor cafe in paris! oh la la! what do you have in your small space that creates a certain vibe and/or style? :: top image via flickr/d'alk and the other two by me :: looking forward to seeing you there!!&nbsp; and if you want to follow us live, you can starting around 7pm pst! just head over to - twitter.com/blogoutloud or #blogoutloud check out the bol blog tomorrow for photos and recaps from tonight's event! i love that line in the sex and the city episode when carrie is writing for vogue and she makes a comment about not "having a {vague} idea". when i was about in my new city, i spotted this neat backdrop featuring vintage vogue covers and had to share it with you guys. how neat would this be framed, leaning against a wall? or hung on wall as a backdrop to a desk area? i bet this could be an easy diy too. just find some vintage magazine images and make your own collection. call a sign company and see how much it would be to print the size you need. hmmm, more to come on this one in my own small space!&nbsp; like many of you, i heart target! i get lost in the aisles of goodies and love their designer series across the board. plus they have the best pomegranate scented candles - yes! i just spotted these exclusive keys on their site , thought they were super cute and wanted to share with you guys. often overlooked, your key ring is your first step into your small space so add a key ring that makes you happy!&nbsp; lately i've been seeing a new crop of x-benches popping up with a more industrial vibe and really am considering this look - love it! there's something classic about this style yet the it's accessible and cool! plus these pieces double, or even triple, in small spaces. i am loving the x-inspired bench that i spotted recently on a blog i recently discovered, good bones, great spaces. i love the placement under the window and that it's a bench more then an ottoman. actually, one of my first apartment therapy posts was about x-inspired furniture . :: image via good bones, great spaces :: 
Male: 100%, Male, giving a talk at the university of utah on everything from scaling, clustering, mysql, mysql internals, nosql (cassandra) to how to manage all this stuff. if you are there at university i'm bringing some swag! also i will upload the slides and put them here. brian aker , a brilliant helpful duder, who i learn a lot from. gives a great talk about what is nosql explained in a way for database guys. i warn you, there are some points in this video where you can't hear brian due to the audience "participation" but you should get the content. innodb has some irritating gotchas that makes disk space management hard. in 2002ish innodb, added innodb_file_per_table to get around allot of these issues, but it does not fix everything. if you are running innodb_file_per_table, you will notice in your database directory db.opt - database characteristics file. tablename.frm - the table structure. tablename.ibd - the actual innodb table space file imagine that you have a table with 10 million rows and you delete say 5 million rows in multiple chunks around 400k chunks, because deletes are slow. next, you notice that the table space file did not shrink. so what do you do? optimize tablename, tada all the wasted space is reclaimed, but here is the problem the ibdata file grew! ibdata stores all of the undo logs thus grows due to the deletes and space is never reclaimed. ok, lets try coping the tablespace file to another directory and re-import the tablespace file after wiping the data dictionary (ibdata). for instance /etc/init.d/mysql stop cd /var/lib/mysql/db cp - /tmp/hold rm /var/lib/mysql/ib- cp /tmp/hold/- /var/lib/mysql/db /etc/init.d/mysql start // create the ibdata file alter table tablename import tablespace error 1146 (42s02): table 'db.tablename' does not exist really, there is nothing that you can do to force innodb to purge the undo logs in the ibdata file without a full dump of the data to text and then reimport the data. so here are the steps to shrink all table spaces and the ibdata file mysqldump --all-databases (or use mk-parallel-dump) stop mysql rm -f /var/lib/mysql/ib- /var/lib/mysql/db/- start mysql mysqlimport (or use mk-parallel-restore) takes a bunch of time but there is no other recourse. if you know of another way please share :) i'll be giving a web presentation jan. 19th 2010. if you would like to check it out please do! scaling to 200k transactions per second with open source - mysql, java, curl, php i thought it went well. i will post the link to the slides here :) scaling to 200k transactions per second with open source - mysql, java, curl, php in a procedural language without the use of threads (or inter process communication via forks), to execute i/o requests they are done one after another. synchronous queries produce at best a big-o of n such that n is an element of i/o communication (queries) and n equals the number of queries needed to achieve the requested dataset. with ipc or threads we can speed up common o(n) problems to reduce the n with parallelism, its still functionally a o(n) yet from a single instance point of view n is much less because threads (ipc) takes that serial computing component and executes the code in parallel. to better explain what i am talking about lets look at some php code: foreach($friends as $friend){ $data[] = getmysqldata(“select - from accountdata where userid = $friend); } the primary key for the accountdata table is userid. assuming that you have 5000 friends, the query has to be executed 5000 times. we can reduce the o(n) and change it to a o(nlogn) (binary tree - doesn't take into account other factors) by switching the query to $data = getmysqldata(“select - from accountdata where userid in (….)”); we just sped up the retrieval of the data significantly, yet we just introduced a bottle neck on the datalayer. our architecture requires that the data is located in a single location. what if accountdata’s data is spread across many servers federated by userid? this means that userid belongs to a server, so the server contains a shard of the accountdata’s data. now we are back to a o(n) where each query needs to be executed on the corresponding shard. the logical next step is to group queries per shard and run across them all. for instance $multishardids = $genericshard->getmultipleshardids($objids); foreach ($multishardids as $shardid => $sharduserids) { if (stripos($orgquery, " where ") !== false){ $query = $orgquery." and {$column} in (".implode(',', $sharduserids).") "; } else{ $query = $orgquery." where {$column} in (".implode(',', $sharduserids).") "; } $shard_to_sql[$shardid] = $query; .... more stuff .... yet this is still a o(n) its just that n is smaller. each query is still executed serially. let’s look at some stats of synchronous queries of select 1; this query is executed across 35 shards and the timings are from php point of view. field end value start value delta ru_oublock 0 0 0 ru_inblock 0 0 0 ru_msgsnd 0 0 0 ru_msgrcv 0 0 0 ru_maxrss 0 0 0 ru_ixrss 0 0 0 ru_idrss 0 0 0 ru_minflt 9872 9865 7 ru_majflt 0 0 0 ru_nsignals 0 0 0 ru_nvcsw 11344 11114 230 ru_nivcsw 977 968 9 ru_nswap 0 0 0 ru_utime.tv_usec 865054 849053 16001 ru_utime.tv_sec 16 16 0 ru_stime.tv_usec 556097 552097 4000 ru_stime.tv_sec 1 1 0 total execution time 0.18323707580566 as you can see, to execute this from php it took 100 ms, 100s pages reclaimed and 200s voluntary context switches to query 35 servers. now let’s look at asynchronous execution of select 1; // the query generation is from php yet the execution is performed on a server that executes the query in parallel field end value start value delta ru_oublock 0 0 0 ru_inblock 0 0 0 ru_msgsnd 0 0 0 ru_msgrcv 0 0 0 ru_maxrss 0 0 0 ru_ixrss 0 0 0 ru_idrss 0 0 0 ru_minflt 9131 9121 10 ru_majflt 0 0 0 ru_nsignals 0 0 0 ru_nvcsw 3891 3889 2 ru_nivcsw 290 290 0 ru_nswap 0 0 0 ru_utime.tv_usec 596287 596287 0 ru_utime.tv_sec 4 4 0 ru_stime.tv_usec 460028 460028 0 ru_stime.tv_sec 0 0 0 total execution time 0.019363880157471 as you can see from the table above executing the query asynchronously produced results with less context switching, less pages reclaimed and almost 10 times execution improvement over the synchronous query counterpart. how is the asynchronous query executed? lets take a look at the figure below. so a user comes through the firewall / load balancer with a http request to the www pool that runs php. php now makes a curl request to the async shard servers (through a lb same lb different port). the http request to the async shard server contains the sql we wish to execute. the async shard servers has a thread per shard and executes the request in parallel. the results are merged and sent to the calling curl process via json. the returned json is then converted into a php object. this is a typical three-tier environment. when having to query multiple servers using an asynchronous tier is dramatically faster; in fact its as fast as the slowest server. this is the main sticking point of why asynchronous queries are faster then synchronous queries (in this context) since the total execution time for serial queries is the sum of all the query execution. the current version of the server is used for friend query execution across the datalayer. its been solid for a few months now, and i'm currently getting permission to release it as an open source product. the features this server contains: lightweight cpu bounded scales linearly a timer thread to keep the database config up to date in memory and fetching the config from php so if php changes connections to the shards so does java uses java-6 executor service merges the result set prior to sending it to the calling process communicates via json uses mysql connector/j supports a high concurrency optimized thread usage if i have run into a mysql bug, i look to see if that bug is fixed by searching the mysql bug database. if i've notice a performance bottleneck, i look to see if the performance bottleneck has been fixed by searching the same database. i will not upgrade to the latest and greatest version of mysql (5.4) i stay within my branch (5.0). these are my three general motivations that drive my upgrade decisions. anytime i upgrade i also make a list of things that might affect my environment for the stuff i use. here are my steps: check the change log ignore all the ndb changes... i don't use it and that's the majority of fixes. this is also, why i do not use it. list the changes that will affect the production environment deploy the version that i picked on a few servers running my original config do data corruption tests (make sure my checksum scripts return the same data) verify that the problem i'm trying to fix is fixed deploy to more boxes let the new server bake for a period of no less than a week deploy everyplace so now, i'm upgrading from 5.0.56 to 5.0.86. what i'm trying to fix is mysql memory overhead at high levels of ram. for instance, i have a slew of 48gb boxes. i set the bufferpool to 40gb; the os uses 1 gb of memory (roughly) leaving an overhead of 7gb for the system cache and various spikes of sort buffers. over a period, i see that mysql will consume and hold onto 47gb of memory for an unknown reason even with some tight my.cnf settings. (i'm certain they are tight since i know what each buffer does). therefore, testing some later versions of mysql we found that these later versions do not grow past the settings defined yet performs the same. next, since i decided that upgrading is a good solution, now it’s time to list all the changes that fixes things. 5.0.58 - innodb performance fix 5.0.60 - various problems that i should be affected by but havn't noticed so it’s fair to assume that said problems were introduced after my build. 5.0.62 - nothing major noticed the sp releases that's why i wait. 5.0.64 - nothing major 5.0.66 - security fixes and fixes to fix the bugs introduced from this build. 5.0.67 - two innodb performance fixes and crash bug fixes. 5.0.68 - changes show status and fixes an innodb crash bug. 5.0.70 - fix another innodb crash bug and security fixes 5.0.72 - more general bug fixes 5.0.74 - more stuff i don't care about 5.0.75 - stuff given to enterprise users now in community 5.8.76 - more bug fixes that i do not need 5.0.78 - more bug fixes i do not care about (run ms access on windows not mysql) 5.0.80 - problem with error messages for concurrency limits that caused an assert failure 5.0.82 - fixes to fix fixes for this build. 5.0.83 more minor fixes that i don't seem to have a problem from 5.0.84 - more bug fixes for innodb and latches 5.0.85 - looks like windows fixes 5.0.86 - fixes that i'm not having problems with therefore, overall, upgrading should give me a boost in performance. my own internal testing sees some tighter memory usage, even though this is not fixed explicitly, the product has matured overall so i can account for the reduction in memory to that. what is nagios? nagios imho is the best open source monitoring system out there. it supports hosts checks, a level to determine on a host level if a box is considered "up". it supports service check, a level to determine if a particular service such as mysql is up. it has features to log all events to a flat file or to a db. it can notify you when a service is in a warning state, error state or unknown state. for the purpose of this article, i am going to talk about handling events such as a clearing up swap. first, let us look at some configuration of nagios. we are going to define a command, then service acting on that command. let us assume that the nagios install is in /usr/local/nagios. therefore, in /usr/local/nagios/ a few configuration files are key: - /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg - the command file where the checks are defined - /usr/local/nagios/etc/hosts/-/hosts.cfg - the services file where the checks are defined for execution based on other directives in this file. a command: # 'check_local_swap' command definition define command{ command_name check_local_swap command_line $user1$/check_swap -w $arg1$ -c $arg2$ } this says that check_local_swap executes check_swap with a warning threshold of $arg1 and a critical threshold or $arg2 next when defining a service for a host define service{ use generic-service; name of service template to use host_name dbfacebook34b ; hostname service_description sys:swap ; what shows up in alerts is_volatile 0 check_period 24x7 ; threshold when to check (all the time) max_check_attempts 4 ; threshold to check before marking state event_handler handle-swap ; handle an event (another command) normal_check_interval 5 ; in seconds retry_check_interval 1 ; only try once before reporting the state contact_groups itops ; contact group to send notifications to notification_options w,u,c,r ; need to look this up for all defs notification_interval 600 ; retry sending notifs every 8 mins notification_period 24x7 ; keep sending them check_command check_nrpe!check_local_swap!80%!55% ; execute the event handler and warn like hell } lots of goodies as you can see. let us look at the event handler define command{ command_name handle-swap command_line /home/scripts/handle_swap.pl } this means execute this script whenever any event for swap occurs (i decided to make this simple and not put a threshold on this). what does handle_swap.pl do - well it’s a perl script that looks at free memory and if only a few 100k of swap is in use, swapoff -a; swapon -a; in this case, it is a bit safe to do this. why do this? why not just turn of swap. i have talked in depth about this subject-but for a minor recap. linux needs swap else, kswapd will freak out. swap in db's is bad so i clean it up automatically since o_direct on my san is not an option. why not just run a cron job? nagios keeps a log, i like to review what is happening from a central location, and nagios is freaking cool. for the first time ever i took a two-week vacation. how can a person who has 100s of database servers, 100s of web servers, and a system that supports 100k tps across 20 tb of data is able to take a vacation? easy, i have a great team that is very competent in managing the platform by following our cookbook routines and guidelines for new application interaction with the databases. where did i go? i went to nyc-stayed in tribeca and only ate pizza, hotdogs, white castle and hala food from vendors that are nearly on every street corner. i also lost 6 pounds! after three months of half-ass dieting to prepare for my pizza diet, who would have known that just going for it was the key to success! how did i do it? well, first i walked to little italy, bought 2-4 slices, ate them, and then walked around the city. that is it. as a database dude, i do not do much walking except for when i am too tired to run on the treadmill for 20 mins. i was averaging around 10 miles a day for a 12-hour period walking around nyc taking pictures, enjoying the sites, eating, drinking, and then repeat. i even walked from canal street all the way to the staten island ferry just because. man it was great. after nyc, i went to puerto rico for the second time. my family and i had a freaking awesome time. we went to the only us national park that is a rain forest. went to vieques to the bio luminous bay, where the single cell organisms light up when kinetic energy is applied to them. went to culebra, to flamenco beach – which is off the hook: much better than any other beach i have been to. drove around the entire main puerto rican island stopping off in rincon and eating every 3-4 hours. i am fully rested and feel like a 20 year old again. so, expect a lot more posts. i think the order will be: migrate 20 tb of data into a new format without downtime. how to make friend queries work with a database. throughput increase from asynchronous queries. 
Female: 100%, Female, dear friends of bubby, six years ago we started a blog with our grandmother, bubby, as a way to share her wise advice with the world. we knew that everyone would love her wit, candor and compassion. this little experiment soon turned into something more special than we could have ever imagined. within months, bubby was receiving letters from thousands of people around the world, pouring out their hearts, and sharing their most personal stories with our grandmother. she loved offering her help. she loved reading your letters every day. she was so proud to be a bubby to all of you. sadly, last night, we lost our bubby. at 94, she was still beautiful. thank you for all of your contributions over the years. you helped make her life that much more special. with love, the granddaughters reader update! in july of 2006, we received a letter from a 29-year old woman with a broken heart . and this wasn't the first time she had to pick up the pieces. she and her fiance were supposed to be married in 2005, but he called it off and they parted ways. 6 months later he found his way back to her, begged for forgiveness, re-proposed, and she accepted. a few months went by and he called off the wedding again. but of course he kept her dangling and her hopes for a third reunion remained high. when you hear a story like this, you want to yell from the rooftops, "forget him!" but as we all know, the heart can be hard-of-hearing sometimes. and this girl needed some advice. leave it to bubby to set things straight. bubby wasted no time referring to this man as an " immature fellow ." she wrote, " i recommend you forget him and if he calls, just tell him the party is over... there are many fish in the sea and i am sure there is one who is looking for you... life with this person will never happen. i wish you all the happiness in the world." even an anonymous commenter left a note saying: " bubby's quite right. if he breaks it off once, and comes back, and all's well, fine. we all make mistakes, and we all have doubts. if he breaks it off twice?! run, and never look back." there is nothing we love more at this website than an update letter with a happy ending. so we are pleased to report that nearly 3 years to the date of this original posting, we heard from this woman again. what do you think happened? did he finally grow a pair? did she learn her lesson? did she take bubby's advice?" read on to find out... dear bubby, i wanted to write to up-date you and to thank you for the very good advice you gave me some three years ago now. my then fiance had called off our wedding for the second time and i was so distressed. you said i should forget this immature person who had wasted so much of my time. i took your advice and it really really worked out! after deciding to end all contact with my ex-fiance, i worked hard on my career and found a fantastic new job. the very first month i met a colleague in another department and, in time, we fell in love. we married last year and are now expecting our first child. with my ex, everything was difficult. with my now husband, everything is easy - we can really talk and he is so kind, fun and gentle. and, he was, from the beginning, absolutely sure about me. he is also supportive of my career as we work in the same field, something my ex never was. really, he just cares deeply about my happiness and i couldn't imagine that i could ever love someone as much as i love him. i never would have found this wonderful man if i hadn't taken your advice. anyway, just to thank you. writing to you and receiving your sensible response was a great comfort to me then, and i am so grateful i listened to your wisdom. wishing you and your family every happiness, no longer 'heart-broken all over again.' thank you!! xo, the granddaughters and happy passover! searching for the afikomen can be quite a chore tipsy from the wine you drank glasses, 1 to 4. filling up on matzah brie children ask, "on this night, why...?" what better way to celebrate than to have bubby make your seder plate. april 17, 2005: a bubby's passover wish for everyone april 24, 2005: 32 people around the table! april 25, 2005: noodle yummy on passover? june 22, 2005: why 8 days? passover cartoons: here. love, the granddaughters happy birthday! no, not to bubby. one of her granddaughters is turning 31 this week! we'll be visiting bubby over the weekend to celebrate with her. plus, rumor is we're going to be baking hamentashins with her too. now that's what bubby calls a party. (by the way, if you need the recipe again, here it is . and here's the baking video we made last year.) but, back to the aging process. here are some great birthday-themed letters that have been sent to bubby over the years: is it approrpriate to have a jewish baby naming ceremony for a boy on his first birthday ? why did he act so distant at my birthday party even though he drove 2 hours to see me? bubby thinks you should take a cold shower and wait until your 16th birthday party. my husband forgot my birthday , what should i do? if i pretend you are my bubby, will you send me a birthday gift? why don't you buy him a nice broadcloth shirt or a slipover sweater for his birthday ? my boyfriend had fun on his 21st birthday , but i haven't yet. should i marry him? best to everyone! what an historic day! bubby couldn't be more pleased to see barack obama become our new president. she was glued to cnn just like the rest of the world. can you imagine how it must feel to be 93 and see such a pivotal moment in history?? to commemorate the day, we decided to remind you of some great letters bubby has responded to over the years that were related to politics. bubby reflects on bush bush talks to the cia how to become president of your company how to become vice president of your company reflections on reagan's funeral ceremony love, the granddaughters with the economy being what it is today, and stock markets holding your dreams at bay, your financial woes may make you shed a tear, and overdose on panic and fear. but bubby just smiles and to us she'll say, "don't forget. money is round... it can roll towards you, or away." here are some of the best "money questions" bubby has responded to over the years. how can i retire and still take care of everyone? i'm 13 and i really, really need a job if i stayed in india i would have no money problems! my husband is so stressed about our finances i want to make more money before i propose my best friend just won a million dollars i have 7 kids to support but i hate my job love, the granddaughters another year has gone by... another birthday is here to celebrate. happy 93 rd bubby! love, everyone post your birthday wishes to bubby in the comments below. happy rosh hashana! bubby and her granddaughters wish all of you a happy and healthy new year. over the years we have received so many (thousands!) of touching, endearing, tearful, hopeful, soulful letters from people around the world, asking bubby for life advice. we wish for all of you that your stories turn out happy and everyone sees all their dreams come true. and on that note, how 'bout a happy update letter ! on july 25, 2005 , we received a letter from a 25-year old woman living in belgium who told bubby she was planning to marry her boyfriend. she was looking for her first job after graduate school, but the only one available to her was far away in paris. she wasn't excited about the job and didn't feel like it matched her qualifications. but she was afraid her parents would be mad if she didn't accept it. bubby wrote her wisely, " it is a terrible feeling to get up in the morning and go to a job that you don't like or are not qualified for. just give yourself more time to find the job for which you are trained and you are qualified." and then she added, " don't worry about your boyfriend. if you really love one another distance will not make a difference." bubby knows what long-distance love is like ! and she knew there was a way to solve this problem if everyone sat down to talk about it. " put your thinking cap on!" bubby told her. a few years went by, and on march 8, 2006 , we received a great update letter. they were still happily in love and getting married! she did find another job that she was much happier with, even though it still meant geographical distance for the couple. but they visited each other every weekend, and spoke on the phone every day. she wrote, " this is working, because we made it work, with lots of patience and love. thanks for your nice advice to me when i asked for it... i'll send you another update for the wedding." well, we're happy to report that she kept her word. this week we received another great update letter. she wrote: dear bubby, i am very happy to tell you that, due to my good job and good fortune, he was able to come join me in paris to look for a job (which he found easily). we got married in april. we first met in 2003, and it was a difficult 5 years. we got through it, partly thanks to your advice. so thank you very much and take care. from, the old continent 
Male: 100%, Female,  happy new year everybody! what an incredible year 2009 was. it was such a great journey and i have met so many wonderful and talented people along the way. thank you to everyone who has participated in my portrait project here. it was such an honor to have spent time with you and to take your portrait. i am so lucky to have had the chance to meet people from all over. i know some of you thought i should make myself the last portrait but i had already shot myself earlier this year. take a scroll back and find me! but the main reason i chose not to make myself the last portrait was because i wanted to be surprised. i didn't want to plan or think about that too much. i also knew that it would be hard to choose one person so shooting a family seemed to be a great way to end the project. i have been going back and forth with whether or not i should continue the project in 2010 and i have also decided not to continue l'image quotidienne in this new year. i am sorry if i am disappointing anyone but this project was to be for one year and although it would be great to continue on, indefinitely for that matter, there are some other projects that i would like to work on. i know i won't be able to completely stop shooting portraits of random people i see on the street but please look for those posts on my m photo blog . thank you everyone for your kind comments and support. i am so grateful. but before i say goodbye i wanted to leave you all with two last portraits. they are the same ladies i shot at the beginning of this blog. what a difference a year makes! and please don't forget to check out what my december portraits are into. super cool stuff people! thanks again and all the best in 2010!! mercedes zen rock caraid o'brien delancy street foundation wooly hoodwinks scalabrini villa alan gallo photographer - artist- musician sean frechette take a portrait. every single day. for one year. december 31, 2009 #365 chris geison 36 years old hometown - baltimore, md 2009 was the best year of my life. #365 innbo shim 36 years old hometown - new york 2009 is the year kyuin came into my life. #365 sean frechette 36 years old hometown - toledo, oh 2009 is overwhelming #365 kyuin 5 months old hometown - brooklyn, ny 2009 is... take a portrait. every single day. for one year. december 30, 2009 #364 alan gallo 57 years old hometown - san francisco, ca 2009 is a year of promise and a year of fear. take a portrait. every single day. for one year. december 29, 2009 #363 jake malmberg 33 years old hometown - fargo, nd 2009 is just ok. take a portrait. every single day. for one year. december 28 2009 #362 natalia dugandzic 28 years old hometown - redwood city, ca 2009 is a year full of change. take a portrait. every single day. for one year. december 27, 2009 #361 rob ames 23 years old hometown - providence, ri 2009 is almost over. take a portrait. every single day. for one year. december 26, 2009 #360 chuck moran 27 years old hometown - foxboro, ma 2009 is over. #360 brittany albert 25 years old hometown - lincoln, ri 2009 was fantastic. take a portrait. every single day. for one year. december 25, 2009 - merry christmas! #359 lee ann potvin 43 years old hometown - coventry, ri 2009 had its challenges but 2010 brings new beginnings. 
Female: 100%, Female,  here are two things i never expected to happen: one, the most amazing, is to find my name on a forbes list . not the one headed by oprah, but deeply exciting all the same; i can now paraphrase all those oscar winners and say how honoured i am to be named alongside such talent, etc, etc. the second thing is that yesterday´s pressure cooker rice was excellent. call it risotto or call it arroz caldoso, it was just unbeleivable, as in, hard to beleive: creamy, perfectly cooked rice, full of flavour, in less than fifteen minutes from the minute i turned on the hob to sitting down? i was deeply sceptical, but figured it worth a try, and so it was. risotto, long banished from my kitchen except as an occasional treat, comes back as a weeknight dinner staple. the rice cooker reigns supreme for white rice and for truly hands off restful cooking, but for quick and incredibly delicious results, this is the one. here is what i did yesterday with what i had, but of course onions can take the place of leeks, chorizo for bacon if you´re so inclined, any other vetetable for the peas, and aromatics can vary: saffron, herbs, etc. pressure cooker arroz caldoso, or risotto adapted from lorna sass sautee two chopped leeks and bacon until the bacon releases its fat and the leeks begin to look floppy. deglaze with some white wine, let it bubble up and add 1 1/2 cups short grain rice. stir, add 3 1/2 cups of stock and cover the pressure cooker. let it come uo to high pressure and count five minutes (five!!! seriously, aren´t you in love already?). now release the pressure and have a look. you might want a bit more broth, or you might want to let some of it evaporate. i thought it was just fine with those meassures. add butter and parmesan and there you are, risotto for three hungry people or four staid ones. i´m a gadget-driven cook. it´s all very well to extoll the virtues of unplugged cooking, and wax lyrical about pesto lovingly made in a pestle and mortar, but for day to day food-on-the-table purposes, i´d be lost without a thermomix, a rice cooker, a blender and a radio.  i thought a slow cooker might be a good thing, since my favourite stews are off the radar. the idea of leaving an oven on for hours in the vicinity of a danger-seeking toddler makes me pale. plus, with two children in the world i´m beginning to feel guilty about our fuel consumption. but slow cookers are hard to come by in spain, and i have had a pressure cooker sitting in a cupboard since i got married almost six years ago, so yesterday i had my pressure baptism. chickpeas in minutes convinced me in seconds, and i´ve been playing with it ever since. my first solo flight was based on this rag ù . i did´t lock the pressure valve properly, and scorched the bottom, but all the same, i had a really tasty chunky sauce that´s made a great filling for empanada . so far, so good. the chicken stock is what has me lost in wonder. i was convinced it would come out cloudy, but tried it anyway, thinking p í a wouldn´t mind. but amazingly, in 45 minutes i had a pot of golden, beautiful, clear broth. i did skim it before locking the lid, mind you, but it didn´t take so long. so now, instead of making a giant 5 litre batch of stock every month or so, i´ll make a amaller 2 litre batch all the time. it´s magic! i have a chunk of pork shoulder marinating even as we speak, waiting to be turned into melt-in-the-mouth shreds of aromatic meat for tomorrow´s lunch. i´ve only been using the pressure cooking for 24 hours, so maybe it´s just a coup de foudre and i´ll drop it in a week. but i don´t think so. i think i´ll be making a lot more beans and curries and stews, and can´t wait for lorna sass´ book to arrive. in the meantime, it´s risotto tonigth with this morning´s chicken stock. and if that works, well, then i can see myself becoming the official pressure cooker bore, as well as the official rice cooker bore. after months of bot being allowed to eat rare red meat, i´m craving a burger bigtime. but i think burgers are best left to professionals, and are best had in greasy, smoky places, and i´m not about to take my precious new baby there, yet, lest he come back smeared with ketchup. a good home alternative? a pepito. ask for a pepito anywhere in spain and you will be given a steak sandwich. if you´re lucky, it will be a thin, juicy paillard type thing, and the oil and meat juices will soak into good, crunchy bread. if you´re not , which is more often the case, you will receive a slab of grey cardboard hunkering between two slabs of nothing bread. this is sad. this is not the sort of sandwich one wants as the namesake for a son and heir. it is a sad testament to the terrible lack of imagination most of spain gives it sandwiches. to my mind, a proper pepito should have something sharp, like mustard or horseradish. something crunchy, like cornichons. greens, like ruccola. butter, if j isn´t looking. and some slippery onions, either just made, or in the lovely form of onion jam . as for the meat, i favour a thick steak, salted, then marinated overnight in whatever´s around. this time it was olive oil, two smashed cloves of garlic, a sprinkling of thyme, a splash of sherry and some fish sauce, but anything goes. sear it so it´s black outside and pink within, let it rest while you assemble the sandwiches on a good fresh baguette, and open a couple of beers. slice the meat thin, and sneak a few slices as you put it inside the bread. you´ll have to agree that this is a beautiful thing, and i for one would be more than glad to share a name with it. here´s a very good reason to stop the rather infrequent postings on this blog: pepe, two weeks old today. he was born three weeks early and so overset all my plans to stock my freezer, get a haircut and write a few posts to have as backup. it´s a pretty blissful life; sure i don´t sleep much at night, but thanks to j and my family i´m allowed to take naps at odd times, eat all sorts of delicious things practically nonstop and enjoy my beautiful babies. my chicken guy at the market is a very sweet fellow who doesn´t mind selling me only half a chicken. free range chickens are so big that even half is over a kilo, and that´s a lot of chicken for me. not that i dislike chicken, but i do find it hard to be fascinated by it. however, stomach flu being what it is, and my baby being now in the grip of it, chicken breast must be gently poached . so my half of a big chicken gives me one big breast half, skin off, that the butcher cuts out. the thigh and the drumstick. a wing. a piece of backbone, and the neck. wing, neck and bone go into the freezer for the making of stock whenever my storage runs low. the other two pieces i roasted today following the method called by la lawson " one-pan chicken ". it results in roast chicken that is quite ok, but that i am happy to leave for a sandwich or pot pie some other day. the star of the show for me are the vegetables; potatoes, onions and carrots that soak up the chicken juices and the fat, char and burn and turn crispy or melting and are just the best thing ever. this time, i spooned yogurt over them and it was quite a revelation. i´ve been down a couple of days with the stomach flu that´s going around. whenever i´ve had stomach trouble, always the get-better food has been the same. the first day one is allowed nothing but lemon water, with sugar and maybe a little salt. then plain white rice, perhaps some dry toast, tea, if you´re looking good, and a little boiled chicken. next day you might progress to boiled ham, and chicken broth, or yogurt with a little stwed apple. you know that you´re definitely getting better when you´re allowed boiled potatoes, in their skins. these come with a thin trickle of olive oil and some crunchy salt, and they are the most delicious thing in the world. not just because you know that you will soon be back to normal, but because after some days of eating really dull stuff your palate is clean, your senses are sharp and you are reminded of just how great very simple things can taste. luckily for me, it´s come just in time to feel pleasantly detoxed and mammothly hungry for my mother´s birthday today. this is going to be a lazy post, by which i mean, i am not going to write up a recipe. the reason? ethnic. i don´t feel i can speak with any authority or knowledge about asian soups. i was born and have always lived in a country that used to have no immigrants, where all chinese restaurants were called "la gran muralla" . they served fried rice and gloopy lemon chicken and if anybody ever asked for a soup there i´ve never met them. now things have improved, and it´s possible to have pretty good stuff, at least in madrid. most importantly, it´s possible to buy lots of ingredients that allow you to replicate many of the lovely things found in books and around the internet. and that´s what the beauty of my lack of asian food education comes in; my standards are so low that i just looove what i make. the fun bit with all these things is stocking up the pantry. a trip to the mostenses market and its adjacent shops will have you coming back with bulging bags for very little money. i buy noodles, won ton wrappers, dried shiitakes, fish sauce, chili garlic sauce, hoisin sauce, big bottles of soy sauce, sesame oil, bean sprouts, good cheap chicken, massive ginger roots, even chinese chives and bok choi and pak choy. it´s a lot of fun. you can even brave the underworld and try to eat at the subterranean restaurant in the plaza de españa parking lot, which is always packed and so rather difficult. i hear it´s great, and hope some day to put it to the test. meanwhile, i´ll be trying to make won tons, and making lots and lots of soup. what kind? well, on lazy days it might be instant miso soup. on more energetic ones good chicken stock with fish sauce, a hint of chili and some mint or chives. and for true soul warming stuff, filling yet light, the full on chicken noodle treatment, or a version thereof with scraps of leftover roast meat. it´s a very accomodating patron, the noodle soup, and one that always hits the spot, so have a go. here´s gasparini , a blog i´ve been meaning to link to for ages. it has the most drop dead gourgeous meringues, and shares the recipes, which is lovely of course. not that i could ever make anything so pretty, ever, at any time, but isn´t it lovely to see it? i have contributed to the all around prettiness, i like to think, in the blog header and the logos, so go have a look. 
Male: 100%, Female, one of the fun things about preparing admission files for review is looking at the names of the recommenders. by this time i am familiar with the applicants' names, but now as i check to see if each student has three letters of recommendation, i am struck by the variety - and funny - names of the numerous recommenders.
Male: 100%, Male, okay, please stop laughing. there have been cases of upstarts beating well-established rivals. before microsoft word came along, many of us were using wordperfect and wordstar. before google came along, we used altavista and yahoo. before internet explorer came along, we used netscape, and now we're watching ie lose ground to firefox. trust me, crazy things happen in the technology space. so, it wouldn't be unthinkable for the zune to give the ipod touch a run for your money. 
Male: 100%, Female, once again, our band of "heroes," and i put that in quotes since the increasingly dislikable james remains part of the tribe, ran up against the dreaded "p-word" at this week's immunity challenge - puzzle. it's really no surprise the villain braintrust is dominating challenges when it comes to using the ole' noggin. what is alarming is heroes leader, j.t's decision to oust one of the tribe's most intelligent players, tom, in favor of james with his bad leg and equally bad mojo. clearly, our heroes are in bad shape, both physically and mentally. but a nasty storm is quickly moving in over at the villains camp, as russell prepares to rain down hell on rob.
Female: 100%, Male, i'm sitting at a conference and my phone does it's little vibraty thing. i pick it up because i'm in the midst of fighting fires at work and dreading the update from the product manager (or is it project manager... i always forget). but there is no email, there is a message from my wife - it's a picture message. i first read the caption and see "cheese dada" only to see the picture load to punch me in the emotional daddy face. there is my beautiful little girl with the cutest grin. my first reaction is "awwww", but immediately follows the, "holy crap i miss them." 
Female: 100%, Female, the first time i saw one night with the king was on january 1 2008 and i loved it. the movie is about the story of esther and how she became queen. the set, the actors, the actresses... everything was very beautiful and i couldn't wait for the dvd to come out so i could watch it again. and when the dvd came out, i did watch it. over and over and over again.

Male: 55%, Male, we all seem to divide our lives up into different sections. some go by relationships, some by children, some by jobs, debt, or even cars. today, i think the world is asking me to step into a new section of life and i'm not sure i want to listen to that call. i'm 25, 1/4 dead, old man river, years beyond my maturity, or whatever else you want to call it. however, i prefer to look at it a bit simplier. i now have a right to make people listen to me. i'm a true adult, no more funny talk, i'm all business now. 
Female: 98%, Female, things have been crazy. i've been of course working on my 365days project but a new distraction has come up. the sims 3. i'm re-addicted to this game. in fact right after i post this i'm going to play it. but it's fine because my homework is done, room semi-clean, and chores have been complete. now i'm off! goodbye for now! 
Female: 100%, Male, so now that i got you going about that hot teacher that you had the hots for, what if i kicked up the hotness factor of the story by mentioning to you, what if along with that first hot teacher was also a second hot teacher at the school! double the pleasure, double the fun! aren't you wishing you were back in high school now? how about we take these two teachers and put them together in an empty classroom? ooof, i can barely look straight now, forget about typing!
Female: 99%, Female, i've had a lot on my mind these past few days. and so i haven't spent much time actually blogging about my relationship with birdie and/or kelley. to be honest, it's all just a little bit confusing to me at the moment. i like what we've done so far, but for some reason i'm ambivalent about moving forward.
Female: 100%, Female, the townehouse was the most packed i'd ever seen. it's been a while since i stood in a crowd in front of a stage, pressed up against strangers, unable to even see the performers on stage.i never knew foosball was such fun and so hilarious. we were shrieking and laughing a lot. i like how when we get together the snacks are always amazing, and sometimes we inject each other with sterile water (some have obviously been acquiring new skills). we sure know how to have a good time.
Male: 68%, Male, we get back to the ship and find that dad is feeling somewhat better, and he joins us for dinner. our next stop will be cozumel, and felix, our waiter, recommended stopping off at carlos'n charlie's, the local party bar. he told us that generally, by 3:00 pm or so, the girls start losing their tops, and the party continues on. he told us that the free tequila flows most of the day. well, that was enough for us! we scatter, and meet again at dizzy's for a little more jazz, and a final nightcap. little did we know that the shit was once again going to hit the fan in the morning...
Male: 97%, Male, the pokéwalker is pokemon soul silver and heart gold's gimmick; a pedometer that records your steps and allows you to build up your pokémon, capture additional pokémon and find items.over at bulbapedia they've determined that to unlock everything the pokéwalker has to offer, it's going to take 1,000 miles of walking. who needs to do that, when you can flat out cheat instead?after some closed-laboratory experiments in my apartment and some field tests, we've determined some effective ways to trick the pokéwalker into thinking you've been walking:

Female: 100%, Female, i borrowed this dress from my roommate. it is typical american apparel, which means it is pretty comfortable and looks good. it's perfect for those mornings when i have to rush to my 8am class. i got this shirt about two years ago at a thrift store. it is the perfect shirt for spring. today was the first warm day since i've been back in vermont. spring is certainly on it's way. 
Female: 100%, Female, we've been on 2 disney cruises and going on our 3rd next month. they are just great. there is always so much to do or you can do nothing. i like the 'doing nothing' part. i go and sit at quiet cove pool-the adults only pool-with a drink with an umbrella in my hand and bask in the sun. there is nothing better than that. all the cast members are so great and helpful. room service is great too!!!! it's just so nice to sit in your room or on your verandah and eat while watching the ocean sail away. we always have a catagory 7 state room so we have a verandah.
Female: 100%, Female, n june my husband and i took a trip through the grand tetons national park and to yellowstone national park. my husband had always wanted to go there, and while i was fine with our destination, i wasn't necessarily all that excited about it. what a blessing it was to go there! i was absolutely amazed and awestruck by the beauty and grandeur of these parks. we stayed in west yellowstone montana at the holiday inn sunspree resort while we toured yellowstone. it was wonderful. 
Male: 99%, Male, "the mis-education of the negro", by carter g. woodson. this is going to be a great book and will make for a great topic of discussion in our next meeting. in my opinion this is a must read for all african americans. it will bring insight into a lot of issues that plight us as a people. and what you will find even more interesting is that this book was published in 1933 but still incredibly relevant to the problems we face today almost 80 years later. 
Female: 64%, Male, so shall i be river letting you flow through brook; like the lines of this poem, i let you paint the sky as blue or the streets of a certain town lazy while there in a brothel, a girl brothel, a girl without the keys of her self allows you the street you make a tone darker.
Female: 86%, Female, jet blue is by far the best airlines i have ever taken i have travel many other but with the rising cost of air-fair i traveled to fl from boston for only 100 and was hooked they even serve my favorite coffee dunk-ins while you kick back and watch tv or movies how much better can it get for 100 bucks please tell me if you can beat that lol thanks jeannie 
Male: 86%, Female, i love continental airlines! they never disappoint me and i am so thrilled with their service. i travel a lot and i just have thumbs up for this outstanding airline. i recommend all travelers to go through continental airlines. they have great employees that are so professional and so caring for us travelers. i feel special and great traveling all the time through them. if i would use another airline, it would be because i am forced to if continental airlines didn't take me to my destination. there are many different ways to earn mileage in this airlines.
Female: 100%, Male, we bought our lexus rx 300 here many years ago and then traded it in for the lexus rx 330 which i now drive. each and every time i have gone back to the dealership for service, they have been amazing. they are fast. they are efficient. they drive me to my office at no cost and then reimburse the cost of a cab when i come back. at the dealership they have a cafe with reading chairs, flat screens etc. and to top it all off, they give free car washes to their customers.
Female: 100%, Male, my wife and i were thrilled that a few friends recommended we try out coast. easily accessible from 90/94, there was no corkage fee for the bottle of wine we brought in and the sushi was excellent. highly recommend the sunshine and volcano rolls in addition to the hamachi/jalapeno. also a huge fan of their spicy miso soup and spinach appetizers. we're going to make this at least a biweekly outing. 
Female: 100%, Male, sebastian has down syndrome and requires more attention than most babies. among other things, he has to be fed every 1 1/2 to 2 hours, even through the night. mindy knew his parents could use a break. so she volunteered to hold him for a while. she sang him to sleep. mindy would be the first to tell you it's a god thing. yep! i think it's just beautiful! and so does little sebastian!
Female: 100%, Female, ginger, my daughter-in-law, just sent me this photo of my grandbabies...ben and charlie. ben is a bit over 3 years and charlie's 7 months old. my cousin saw this photo...wrote me telling me it would be a good advertisement for cosco! aren't they so cute and sweet...it's about time for me to go for another visit! 
Female: 100%, Male, am i the only one who finds atwood's writing the equivalent of a sunday roast? eagerly awaited and elegantly presented, you know that no matter which bit of the chicken you choose, you will always be satisfied. and any puns involving her novel 'the edible woman' are verboten. the roast potatoes will be crunchy, the greens will be soft and the yorkshire puddings will be well cooked. margaret is to me the epitome of a family gathering. i crave her writing style in the same way i crave my wife's roast dinners.
Male: 99%, Male, experience tells me we need to take this, hopefully temporary, yard art to an appropriate specialist. in this case, that would be an auto-electric shop. experience has also taught me the damn thing needs to be running for them to do a diagnosis on it. i’ve been down that particular primrose path before. without their equipment, they have to examine the entire electrical system, a very expensive process, and hope like hell they get lucky. if they don’t get lucky, repair by replacement goes into operation – another very expensive process. two expensive processes do not equal an affordable bill.
Male: 58%, Male, yet, after speaking of god’s intimate knowledge- he asks him to search him. he asks him to see things we normally want to hide from the almighty- anxious thoughts, offensive ways. yet, the psalmist knows what we all know- we cannot hide from god. so if we can’t hide from him, then we should ask his help to overcome our faults and weaknesses.
Female: 99%, Female, first off, dw went as part of a leadership team from our denomination to assess how exactly to plant an orphanage(s). he was told before he left, that they knew that dw's appointment was a divine assignment because of all the orphanages he has been part of, volunteered at, and supported. they also loved that we have adopted 7 kids ourselves. {i love that part too
Female: 100%, Female, sebryna has learned that when she does something naughty, my response is usually "noooo!". now i know when she has been naughty without even looking at her because she says it herself, "mommy, nooooooooo!." ....only it's much cuter because she makes her voice very dramatic with a nasally sound. (imagine someone yelling, "hellooooooo in therrrrre" like they're calling into a cave). so cute!!
Male: 100%, Male, at nearly 19 feet long and dripping with what seems like 500 pounds of chrome, the cadillac escalade esv platinum is the biggest, glitziest, most conspicuously consumptive vehicle in general motors’ lineup. the stretched esv variant is almost 20 inches longer than the regular escalade, with the range-topping platinum package (available on both lengths) adding a new cts-inspired grille and front fascia, along with super-bright led headlights and unique 22-inch wheels.
Male: 100%, Male, i am not the typical rpg gamer. i have never been a fan of the games where you pick your actions from a menu. this is a real-time rpg. it is wide open from the begining, although one might want to watch where they venture. high-level nasties, and locked doors may block your way. if you are a mage, dispatching the baddies will come easier. if you are a theif, you can take care of those pesky locks with ease. but, your class is not limited.
Male: 98%, Male, i used to watch dr. who on pbs with my dad in the eighties. i am not into sci-fi at all. my dad is a trekkie and into the who series deeply. out of all his interests, i shared in dr. who simply because it was a series i could follow because it centered around time travel. time involves most of what we do so it was practical in a sense. we have wondered about the validity of the past, the future and how we apply the present. dr. who's cast involved real people who were relatable. in the area i live now, i was quite disappointed to find the local pbs doesnt air dr. who.
Male: 99%, Female, this company is great. its a new company but its stock will truly show just how much. they have reached some high profit numbers. soon to be again, and steady! i look for metro to become more diverse and expect them to take on a nice share of the cellular market from the "big guys" and make it more affordable to all. 
Female: 92%, Female, i just found a beautiful little book of quotes called "words of the spirit, thoughts to live by" they are compiled from discourses from para pujya ma. i am here in kathmandu and have brought my camera, though unfortunately, i am unable to use my usb port and have no card reader, so i will have to paint the pictures with my words for now.
Female: 100%, Female, god spoke to my heart today. i have been in a season of change. it is much needed changed but it wasn't change i had control over which made me uncomfortable. so for the last 47 days of my life i have been seeking clarity and direction in my life. i have gone through so many different emotions and have questioned god over and over again. i prayed and prayed but weeks have gone by and nothing. nothing has changed in my situation. my days are long and unproductive. i have been completely unmotivated to do anything but the absolutely necessary. 
Female: 67%, Male, i paid 100 bucks for this shirt. however, i'm now able to wear this thing to formal functions, instead of a suit and a tie. can you believe it? i can wear this to the symphony. i can wear this to weddings-i did today. i have to say that i have procrastinated in making what has become an obligatory purchase.
Male: 56%, Male, we are still waiting to hear more details about the atm crooks. one thing that has the town abuzz is that the news reported on wednesday that they had confessions from four more guys, three of whom are 18. for some reason, the news has since blacked out and none of the three names have been made public.
Male: 100%, Male,  alex chilton died today from a heart attack. for those of you who don't know who he was, he was one of the primary members of big star, a band i fell in love with only fairly recently. he wrote some of the most modern-sounding music from the early 70's, unfortunately, big star wasn't as large a commercial success as they deserved to be, releasing only three albums before a long break from recording as a band. it didn't help that their recording company didn't give them a fair break either.
Male: 100%, Male, the big star of today's apple event in san francisco had to be the latest version of the ipod nano. chief amongst the music player's new features is a video camera placed on the bottom rear of the device.after the presentation, out editor-in-chief lance ulanoff managed to get some hands-on time with the new device on the show room floor. check out some more exclusive images of the new ipod nano after the jump. 
Female: 99%, Female, so this morning i came in early to try to get some work done. but some of my colleagues had the same thoughts and came in as soon as i got my door open. sigh. then my internet did not seem to want to work. sigh. and my email was not responding. sigh. but now, as you can see, everything is back to normal, including the time.
Male: 100%, Female, he mac mini has been a great replacement server for my old windows 2003 box. it performs like a champ and with little to no maintenance. i've had it running for over a year now (on 24/7 hosting several websites) and i have not had any problems. i upgraded the ram to 2 gig and other than that i haven't done a thing to it. i use a regular "pc" mouse, a mac wireless keyboard and a sony monitor. it is the only server on my network of 2 laptops and 2 pc's. i couldn't be happier with it and can't wait to upgrade to leopard! 
Male: 93%, Male, alright. in order to finally complete my application, i tried another photo on istockphoto.com. this time it's from the food and beverage category. which is a wanted category of photographs as described in their tutorial or photo training manual. if that pic doesn't fly, i guess i need new camera equipment. as you probably guessed by now, my approach to istockphoto is this. "dude, you take thousands and thousands of photos every year, there must be some stock-worthy stuff in there."
Male: 100%, Male, the is a reviewer favorite, and the iphone 3gs (the s stands for speed) receives accolades as well, although reviewers aren't quite as enthusiastic. available and 32 gb versions, the 3gs boasts an upgraded 600 mhz processor (up from 412 mhz) and 256 mb of ram, double that of the iphone 3g's 128 mb. testing by editors at mobiletechreview.com, pcmag.com and others shows that the 3gs is indeed noticeably faster in loading contacts, email, websites, games and various apps. other than circuitry upgrades, most of the improvements to the iphone 3gs are software-based, and many reviewers point out that current iphone 3g owners can simply download the iphone 3.0 software for free. nearly every reviewer recommends buying the new iphone only if you have the original iphone or haven't yet taken the iphone plunge. 
Male: 100%, Male, the lounge (left) gives your iphone 3gs or 3g a place to recline, whether on your desktop or on a dashboard, so you can easily view the screen. its main use is with gps applications, but it's also handy when you want to watch a video. it lists for $49.99. 
Male: 73%, Male, so, because of my last post, my wife finished both gary unmarried and the first season of frasier with me last night. enjoyed gary unmarried immensely. frasier is very on again/off again for me. some are hilarious, some are funny, and some are a waste of 22 minutes. the season ender for me was in the final category. it was nothing like the rest of the show, and for me was a failed experiment. 
Male: 100%, Male, the 2010 winter olympics games are about to begin in vancouver, canada, and while it isn't the first olympics since the app store launched (it was a month old for the 2008 summer games), it will be the first to receive massive support from the iphone community. from tracking the winners, to virtual recreations of the events to apps crafted just for the athletes, the app store has plenty to offer, and these are some of the best:
Male: 99%, Male, i am hoping against hope that president obama (i can't remember when i have to capitalize "president") can be successful, and not just because i'm a democrat. i am kind of tired to hear the same old opinions that the stimulus plan is too much spending, while at the same time not providing enough tax relief for the upper income brackets. can't anyone acknowledge that supply-side economics didn't work? 
Male: 82%, Female, out of all the contact lens solutions available, clear care by ciba vision does the best job at keeping my contact lenses clean and comfortable. it's a hydrogen peroxide solution and really helps to remove any debris or deposits on my lenses. because my contacts are the kind that are replaced quarterly, it definitely helps keep my lenses feeling fresh even towards the time when i need to replace them. you do have to be careful though. it's not for rinsing your contacts and you can't put it in your eyes or you'll burn them.
Female: 96%, Female, dr. mike examined me after i had been to 10 mds. these 10 others couldn't diagnose my illness and didn't seem to care. dr. mike could tell there was something really wrong and didn't want to treat me, but gave me some great advice as far as treatment i should receive. i followed that advice and am now being treated by a tremendous and brilliant md--one outside the system i had been in. i appreciate his care, concern, and professional advice. i'm doing much better now.

Female: 100%, Female, our family of 4 really enjoyed our cruise on disney cruise line's wonder ship. even though we went off-season and it rained almost every day, it was a vacation we'll never forget. the food was amazing and we felt like royalty every time we dined. the shows were awesome, especially for our kids who had never seen a live theatre production before. they also have very secure child care facilities that the kids just loved! they thought we were dropping them off to have some parent-free fun, not the other way around!

Male: 100%, Male, arrested development is undoubtedly the best sitcom of the 21st century, and it never even got a chance to win the hearts of america. this show had a wonderful blend of topical humor and dry wit. in its three seasons - from the pilot, which was extended and became the first episode, to the epilogue in the third season - arrested development delivered continuous laughs.

Female: 93%, Female, wasn't sure whether we'd have a good experience after all the things i'd read in reviews about enterprise, but we got to the small regional airport late in the day on a thursday afternoon. the compact we had reserved was gone and so we were upgraded to a nissan murano, a nice suv (horrible gas mileage, though).the manager (only one person doing all the tasks) didn't write down a large scratch on the left rear bumper, and i made my husband go back in and have her identify it on her copy. 
Male: 97%, Male, as days go, it doesn’t seem like a bad day. the sun is casting a golden glow on the branches of the cedar and spruce trees in the front yard. other than a couple of drifts created by shovel and blower, the snow has retreated to a few spots that will be shaded by trees for another few weeks. the temperature is balmy enough to make t-shirts a viable alternative to coats. like i said, as days go, it doesn’t seem bad.
Male: 93%, Female, i have flown jetblue many times and i have never had a bad experience. i am a very frequent flyer, taking 100 or more domestic and international airlines trip a year, and i have flown most of the world's airlines, and i have to give jetblue my personal award for being number one, the best. at least in coach. i'm not saying that another airline's first class or business class is not better (although i have flown afew where jetblue's is superior to their premium service. but in general i'm only comparing coach to coach, and the general day to day operations of the airline.
Male: 92%, Female, kathmandu, has changed very little since my last visit except that things are slightly more expensive and there is even less electricity and more garbage. people seem to have given up on the idea that government will be solving their problems any time soon. as a result, there are more electric generators at shops and restaurants.
Male: 100%, Male, from mtv.com: "twilight" stars robert pattinson and peter facinelli have told mtv news that their ideal director for "breaking dawn," the still-announced adaptation of the final volume in the vampire series, would be two-time oscar-nominated director gus van sant. an entertainment weekly report on tuesday suggested that van sant ("milk") is in fact one of three high-profile directors who have been approached to helm the film, along with sofia coppola ("lost in translation") and bill condon ("dreamgirls").
Female: 99%, Male, the way morgan searched for the right bmw was spiritual. finding a 2002 for two thousand two (hundred. it has connection to his mother's memory so when we drove to pick it up in monterey we also visited an artist friend of hers from high school (neutrer.) at the reunion julia reminded everyone (of how prolific jayne was) by the impressive style of dark outlines of playful imagry and we sat at the same table as josh reynolds so we could share trident stories . . in chicago!
Male: 100%, Male, the next optimization technique, i will be demonstrating is a predicate pushing problem. unbeknownst to most developers, sql server 2005 does have a problem with predicate pushing in views. a lot of these issues have been resolved in sql server 2008, but should be known. i will be demonstrating a very simple example, using a ranking function. ranking functions are relatively new to sql server and were introduced in 2005. i am sure there are other scenarios that cause predicate pushing problems, but i will only be addressing the ranking problem, in this post.s

Female: 97%, Female, when i travel, i always try to find a continental flight because i know that most of their flights are on-time and reliable. i also find their seats to be a little roomier. i recently flew american airlines because it was more convenient, but was surprised at how cramped the seats were! in an airplane, when traveling with a lap child (child under 2 traveling on my lap for free), every inch of space counts -- big time! we are very nearly always treated courtesly, although some of the flight attendants seem to be getting a little bit of an attitude, like "we're better and we know it". 
Male: 100%, Male, most of sunbelt software's business lies in supplying malware protection to its 25,000 enterprise customers. sunbelt also licenses its engine and sandbox analysis software to other vendors. but the people at sunbelt are just as passionate about their consumer product, vipre antivirus 4.0 ($29.95 direct). vipre did well in testing, and it offers some bonus features more often found in suites than in standalone antivirus utilities. 
Female: 70%, Male, this stuff is great; i found it through a friend and well never take aspirin again. not only is hyland a great company, the products that they offer are budget conscious and effective. it is not necessarily a great head ache cure but it does sooth my daily aches, when necessary. 
Female: 100%, Female, many people fear the holidays because they are afraid of putting on a few extra pounds. some even turn down party and dinner invitations in hopes of avoiding any new bulges or rolls. however, holidays are the perfect time to touch base with family members and friends that you don’t see regularly throughout the year, so it is important not to let fears of gaining weight prevent you from having some holiday fun.
Male: 96%, Male, in homo sapiens sapiens, that's certainly the case: men try to hoard women, preventing other men from getting access to them, and the morality of "rape" is more about keeping women secure and intact from other males than about respecting women's wishes or decisions. i've been annoyed, in the "evolutionary" discussions of rape i've seen so far, by their careful avoidance of the fact that in the real world, rape is not considered such a bad thing after all, that women are presumed be wanting it secretly, and that men are constantly trying to construct scenarios in which a woman forfeits her right to say no.
Male: 96%, Male, as one of the freshest and most interesting videogame franchises today, bioshock is 100% definitely going to get ruined by 2k. bioshock is loved for its amazing setting that will soon be stripped of all mystique and thought-provoking story and continually ret-conned into sterility. who can forget their first moment they ran into a big daddy, a videogame character who will be marketed until you can't remember why you liked him in the first place?soon bioshock will too join the ranks of innovative franchises such as splinter cell and guitar hero which are now unbearable to even look at. here's now:

Male: 94%, Male, to find classic car insurance quotes you should use the internet. this helps to speed things up quite a bit. in other words, you don't have to sit back and wait for an agent or broker to call you back. instead, you are in charge and taking the initiative. how does that sound to you?
Female: 60%, Male, way back in the 1990s i was at supercuts one day and the tweeker girl doing my buzz cut became fascinated with my irish heritage and how that related to my sparse-but-there body hair. are you irish? she asked. i'm not from ireland, i replied, but my ancestors were. 
Female: 99%, Female, it is progress! if possible, i would like to visit the school when i go to nepal in march and make a contribution to their operating expenses. i would also like to arrange a letter exchange with some of our local school students. but, i will have to wait and see how the plan unfolds. travel restrictions, strikes, and weather can make it difficult to get to rural areas of nepal, and someone would have to offer to host me in their home. with only a two week travel plan, i may not be able to get there and back. if i do get there, i'll bring you pictures and stories. in february, i will be giving a free lecture on 'life and work in nepal during difficult times.' i will discuss the effects of 911 on nepal, the murder of the entire nepalese royal family, endless annual strikes, and the maoist revolution. the lecture will be held at the plymouth ucc in shaker heights, oh. sunday february 14th, 9:30 - 10:20 am in room 102.

Male: 100%, Female, the mughals had a dress code and would not wear the pant/shirt cause mostly non-believers would wear them. however, now a days even our so-called islamically established states have the concept of the western pant/shirt deeply engraved in their societies. so what now? what do our youth do? a solution can be to take these western concepts and "islamisize" them. a good example would be clothing. take the western pant/shirt and make them longer, and looser. as muslims we should look decent and healthily smart, not overly dressed to the extreme. and muslims we should not lose our identity in the process. 
Female: 100%, Female, evlon challenges its customers to “get cheeky” with their new pinch me sheer gel blush. being the makeup junkie that i am, i rose to the challenge and decided to give this new product a try. i did hesitate for a brief minute since i’d never heard anything positive about blush gels, but ultimately i decided to jump on in. i’m glad that i did!
Female: 100%, Female, the husband finished his breakfast and refused to take mom to the bank or walk lucky when asked. mum won't drive with me and would rather cancel her plans instead, which she did. as i was beginning to log out, what a girl wants was playing on tv and it was too tempting to let pass but i had to. i had things to get done. the husband went to sleep and refused to move, no matter how many times i called him. annoyed and needing a break, i sat down to watch the movie.
Female: 100%, Male, not sure where to start on this one, it moved me and brought me to tears. this young girl, precious jones, it starts off with her a 16 year old girl. she has no education, and is very overweight. wannabe father molesting her, her mother is a worthless abusive figure in her life that resents her for the father molesting her, and her bearing children of his. precious is abused and discarded thru her life at home, brought me to tears the things her mother said to her. i can see why monique won the oscar, ( she played the mother) it had to been a hard role to act.
Female: 100%, Male, i spent a lot of time last week cogitating about the topic for my next blog. the ideas that crossed my mind ranged from the mirthful experiences in my college (in continuation of my first blog) to the heavy ones like ‘hindutva’. i also thought of writing about my blissful life in school but later decided against it. as i sat down to write about anything which inaugurates my thought process, a much uncomplicated idea came to my mind about the most cherubic and audacious (arguably) person on this heavenly planet. yes, i am going to write few things about my angelic mother (though in a slap-stick way!!). well i am not going to discourse the love that is shared in the mother-child relationship (for that you can always listen to the famous song from taare zameen par). what i am going to talk about here are rules that every mother sets in her house to keep a check on people living under her domain (well in my case, this kingdom consists of me, my brother and dad too!!). if you are a girl and are reading this, chances are you would not agree. but read on and i am sure you would be convinced.
Male: 63%, Female, it's our 20th episode and to help us celebrate, ugo's man about town, parker ward, dropped in to discuss the current holy tv trinity of idol, lost and the olympics. are simon and ellen really mortal enemies or is their "feud" just another lame publicity stunt? does survivor really suck? is hoarders the best thing since intervention? and when will claire quite yammering about her "bay-bay?" all this and more answered to the best our ability on this week's cast! let us know your thoughts on these matter in our facebook group and keep toob tied on constant rotation by subscribing to us on itunes!

Male: 67%, Male, lenovo has built a reputation for constructing quality laptop keyboards, as evidenced by those found in its thinkpad and ideapad lines. but a good keyboard has somehow eluded its 10-inch netbook line until now. in addition to getting new intel parts, the lenovo ideapad s10-3 ($370 direct) has received a full-size keyboard and the kind of typing experience that has garnered praise for netbooks like the editors' choice toshiba mini nb305-n410 ($400.00 direct, ) and the hp mini 5102 ($400 direct, ). unfortunately, while the toshiba nb305 and hp 5102, which have a roomy touchpad and soft mouse buttons to compliment the keyboards, the s10-3's one-piece touchpad does the opposite.
Male: 100%, Male, recently, i was frustrated while trying to package a java keystore file from my maven project to a project archive (tar or zip) using assembly.xml. somehow, when i used the command: keytool -keystore cacerts -list on the certificate keystore inside the tar/zip archive, it would just say that the keystore is invalid. after some search, i found that there is a little setting in the pom.xml which instructs maven not to do any filtering tasks on the files you specify when you execute a maven command.
Female: 100%, Female, and. my hair!? something really weird is happening to my hair! i can't seem to find a shampoo and conditioner that doesn't leave my hair grimy and gross. in the last couple of weeks every shampoo and conditioner i have used makes my hair feel like it has a terrible build up.

Male: 100%, Male,  1. no ice… if your ice maker has stopped making ice then you need to check these things. 1. the lever that controls the ice maker has been pushed up which turns it off. if you have a red lever, pull it down to the wire and if you just have a wire then just pull down the wire to start your ice maker up. 2. make sure the freezer temperature is below 10 degrees f if the freezer is too warm ice production will be poor because the ice maker will not cycle properly. 3. the ice maker fill tube may have ice formed in it, blocking it. use a hair dryer to melt the ice. watch out for the plastic parts, so that you do not melt the plastic. also check the water inlet valve and the shut off valve, to make sure it is not plugged with debris. the openings in those valves are very small. 4. check the gears in the ice makers to see if they are broken or stripped. also look to see if the ice rake is broken. all parts in the ice maker are replaceable individually, if you find broken parts replace them.
Female: 92%, Female, my last three flights booked on jetblue were all cancelled. without notice. without warning. no phone call. no email. it has been extremely frustrating. while i know flight cancellations happen, i do expect to be notified so i don't get all the way to the airport before i find out!

Female: 100%, Female, i use all of hylands products! i love the arnica and any time someone is hurt i give it to them. i also love the fact that it is safer than name brand products you see in the store. about four years ago my daughter fell and hit a sprinkler so hard that it snapped in half. my parents were going to give her tylenol and i said no!! the bruise was about four inches all the way around. i had my mom give her arnica tablets three times a day and then apply arnica cream to the bruise in the morning and then again at night.

Male: 100%, Male, i traded in my 2003 ultra classic (42,000 miles) in august on a new 2009 ultra classic. the dealership i bought from was making deals too good to refuse. they even beat a different dealers offer, on a 2008 model no less, by $3000 ! mine is the new for 2009 flame blue pearl color. it has turquoise pin-striping as well. so far, having ridden about 2,500 miles, and in 2 other states, i am loving it ! it rides smoother and firmer than the "03 did. i attribute this to the new,wider rear tire/wheel.
Female: 100%, Female, ve done a lot of research when it comes to dog food. i am not a dog owner that buys my dog cheap food that has potential to cause a lot of allergies. california natural is one of the best, top of the line dog food you can buy. my dogs have the softest coats. i am a doberman owner and i do not cheap out on my 'babies'. that being said, a large bag is close to $45-50 in michigan. furthermore, i have to drive about 25 miles to get a bag because the local pet stores (petsmart, petco) do not sell this line. 
Male: 100%, Male, it must have been torture for south park creators trey parker and matt stone, as all the tiger woods events unfolded while they were on hiatus.when you dangle raw meat above a cage of wolves (or tigers), they tend to get hungrier and a lot more rabid - and in trey and matt's case - a lot more creative.finally, we get to see what must have been brewing in their deeply disturbed minds all these months with the season fourteen premiere entitled "sexual healing."
Female: 100%, Female,  my uncle for one will vouch for banning me from almaghrib, yes, this isn't the first time sammo has decided she has has has to go to an almaghrib class and tell him that it would be advisable to come another weekend, that is if him and the family decide to pay us a visit (which they probably will). i love my family and relatives and they have and always will be priority, but almaghrib is my life now and sometimes its hard to decide between the two loves of my life.
Female: 100%, Female, wow, the us is gorgeous.....and big! i just got back from a five day trip to yellowstone national park and the grand tetons with my 13 year old nephew. what a fantastic trip! it is like bringing your 7th grade science class with you on tour.i generally knew what a geyser was, but, well not exactly. and the difference between a geyser and a hot spring or boiling mud pot? no, not at all. with land spontaneously spitting out steam and mud bubbles, you can see why a 13 year old boy had a fabulous time.
Male: 95%, Female, my husband and i love watching "arrested development" on dvd. we need to buy the series already!! we have rented the entire 3 seasons from netflix too many times to count. what i really want to know is who made the decision to take this series off the air? i mean seriously, are they still employed at fox or what? i would love to hear your comments if you know the answer or even want to rant.
Male: 100%, Male, sorry, schwim-fans, but ross gellar is off the market.as reported by us magazine, david schwimmer (43) will soon tie the knot with his girlfriend of three years, zoe buckman (24). and yes, your math is correct: daddy schwimmer took her to get her first legal drink.actually, that’s not entirely accurate, as the lucky couple (it’s the first marriage for both) met in england on the set of schwimmer’s successful comedy run fatboy run. and just to be clear, by “successful,” i mean, “only comedy that’s successfully made simon pegg not funny.” so that means buckman has possibly been drunk since she was eighteen, which may explain her taste in men.
Female: 100%, Female, his straightener is okay, when i first got it i was so excited, it worked great but i was noticing that after awhile it didn't work as good. it's been 5 months now and when i put it on a lower temperature it automatically turns off, and the plate covering is all chipped off. so basically i am going to have to buy another straightener due to i can't use this one anymore or it will chip even more. if you are planning on buying this product, i highly recommend you take extra good care of it or it will definitely break soon enough. i am going give the sedu a shot! 
Female: 100%, Female, although i should be doing 100 other things, i just want to write and say how happy i am and how blessed i feel. i think i have the greatest kids in the whole wide world. they are really great! they try so hard to be good. thobe had an assignment the other day to fill out a star that said,, "i am special because..." and thobe wrote, "i am special because i am good." i hung that next to my phone. whenever i see it i think, "he is good. all my boys are just so good." i love them so much. 
Female: 100%, Female, cargo plantlove eyeshadow ($20, sephora) is proof that “green” beauty is not merely eco-chic. it’s eco-fabulous.even if i didn’t know that this eyeshadow was organic, i really wouldn’t care. plantlove eyeshadow is, for the most part, silky, deeply pigmented and highly blendable.my top pick out of the collection is dove, a sexy and utterly wearable shade of neutral deep blue gray that performs beautifully as both an understated liner by day and a dramatic, lid-to-crease, smoked-out eyeshadow by night.

Female: 100%, Female, eating 5 fruit and vegetables a day. fortunately, the shops are helping us to achieve that goal. but don’t think just 5 fruit and no vegetables is enough; a new study by rush university medical center in chicago has concluded that eating 2+ vegetable a day can help slow down mental decline due to ageing. those people who ate 2.8 servings of vegetables almost halved their rate of memory decline compared to people who ate less than 1 serving a day. according to the study, it is not too late to start, as older people who started the 2+ veg a day still showed significant delay in mental decline.
Male: 100%, Male, i've always been a gadget fiend, having bought dozens of digital cameras, mp3 players, handheld gps devices, and cell phones .. now all in one. my favorite things * design - so clean, plus love the touch screen * google maps - more than a map, also shows you bus/train options and travel time * google voice search - much easier to say a few words than to type them * safari - full on web browser, fast when on wifi * mp3 player - love my 32gb and sync with itunes playlists * all the apps - games, productivity * and specific to 3gs - way faster than 2g, and compass makes some apps better, like google maps 
Male: 100%, Male, it's really difficult to settle on any one aspect of this episode that i'm the most excited about. i was serious when i noted two weeks ago that chuck offers more plot progression and character development than any 5 episodes of lost, and "chuck vs. the tic-tac" offered that, and so much more.it takes guts to remove the fangs of any series' most bad-ass character, but all our base are belong to adam baldwin for handling the birth of, defection and (figurative) death of john casey with such believable dramatic weight. 
Male: 95%, Male, in case you don't already know, last night i won "puckett's rising star" competition. this was a contest held at puckett's grocery in franklin among nashville songwriters judging on song quality and performance. the contest had three rounds; 8 seperate opening rounds, a semifinal round of sixteen, and a final round of four writers. (about 120 writers total)
Male: 100%, Female, "i often compare backbreaker, weirdly, not to other football games, because we feel it's so different. the game that comes to mind for me is burnout. burnout's a driving game, but you don't need to be an expert driver to have fun with that. because even if you fail in burnout, you fail spectacularly and it looks cool and it feels good. even when you've just smashed your car up, it looks really cool.
Female: 100%, Male, i was born in 1946 and lived outside of mitchell, south dakota by the james river i did a lot of hunting, fishing and trapping. there was a rock dam on the river where at one time stood a flour mill. i would spear carp and sell them to a nearby mink farm where they where used as mink food. i went to riverside grade school, a one-roomed country school house ….then i went to mitchell senior high. 
Female: 78%, Female, last saturday we went to a so called gypsy fair, which was more market for weird stuff then actual fair. but the “house trucks” were interesting to look at. if you imagine an old gypsy wagon then transpose it onto an older style truck you kind of can imagine what they were like. but overall it was rather disappointing, as much is becoming here. like greg’s aspirations for work. for weeks he diligently prepped his resume, reviewed immigration information and made profiles on various job search websites. but often when he went back to those websites he couldn’t use his log in information and so emailed the websites for assistance. 
Female: 92%, Male, try as i might i just cant seem to get you off my mind. you’re so much better than any other i could hope to find. no need to be kind i can see you’ve made up your mind. you’ve been nothing but an absentee to me, but i know i don’t want to be free from your grasp. slippery as it may be.
Female: 97%, Male, my across the street neighbor has a two-year old chocolate lab, which turns out to have had serious knee problems in her back legs. (actually, they are called hocks, but the right word only gets in the way here.) 
Male: 100%, Male, as much as i liked - but didn't necessarily love - avatar, i absolutely got that it was a big-screen, 3d, imax experience, meant to be enjoyed in an immense theater, filled with the latest in cinematic technology and surrounded by fans as emotionally connected to the material as yourself. it was the kind of movie that simply wouldn't be as engaging at home, no matter how high the definition in which you watched it...or how large your television...or how great your sound system... 
Female: 100%, Female, his is the only food i have purchased for my bully since he was ten months old. it was highly recommended in my online bully groups; so thought i would try it. and i have never been disappointed for a minute! i have noticed how much easier it is for my dog to eat this than the puppy food he was on; as well as the fact that his flatulence is now virtually non-existant. i can't vouch for the flavor as my dog will eat anything; but i do believe in this product! i buy mine at petco; and a bag at a cost of approximately $35 will last me about a month; and every tenth bag is free! 
Male: 84%, Male, rather than a straight adaptation of carroll’s stories, woolverton has chosen to stage her story 13 years after the events in the books, which essentially makes this film a sequel of sorts; its closest cousin in this arena is another disney-sanctioned reworking of classic children’s literature, walter murch’s return to oz (1985), an extremely dark and violent product of the reagan era that has virtually nothing to do with victor fleming’s candy-colored musical. as dorothy did in that film, alice returns to wonderland years later, only to find it enmeshed in conflict and alarm. both films reunite their young heroines with an array of weird and endearing characters, and interestingly both also feature queens who are obsessed with decapitation (in return to oz, the evil queen keeps a closet of assorted heads to “wear,” whereas in alice in wonderland helena bonham carter’s red queen just likes to cut them off). 
Male: 99%, Male, the turning point of the game came in the fourth quarter when clint sessions picked off joe flacco and returned it for a touchdown. and if that wasn't enough, robert mathis stripped flacco on the next play and the colts recovered.
Female: 100%, Female, i've made my very first mosaic picture, and it's all thanks to mary over at little red house and the tutorial that she made! i do also want to thank brenda over cozy little house for giving me that info! thank you both so much! seeing how much i loveeee pictures i know what i'm going to be doing alot of. please don't forget to stop in at mary's blog little red house, she's the hostess of mosaic monday and there you'll be able to view every ones beautiful mosaic pictures, maybe even enter yourself! so until the next time...bead happy! hugs and happy beading...
Female: 63%, Female, my charts are becoming real pieces of art these days. my most recent work is the gumball chart, inspired by chase's deep desire for a gumball machine in the house. my kids don't chew gum at this point in their lives unless it's a special treat from gramma, but i'm liking the idea of having one in the house for the sole purpose of rewarding super excellent behavior. so, once all three of the gumball charts are filled, we'll head to the store to find a real life gumball machine of our own. 
Female: 100%, Male, as i drift in and out, i can only hope that you are doing the same. somewhere else wherever you may lay i hope you dream of delightful days with you and i. dream of me as i dream of you, dream of me as only you can see. dream of me as i dream of me. dream, just let yourself go ahead and dream...your all i really care about. and there is no doubt that i'd wait forever and a day until your ready to be with me…
Female: 100%, Female, i have been flying for over 50 years domesticly and internationally. during that time, i have flown a lot of different airlines.several years ago, i flew jet blue airways with my daughter and grand-daughter and we absolutely loved it.jet blue airways was clean and looked new. there was actual enough leg room so you didn't feel like you were sitting in the other passenger's lap.jet blue provided me with many choices of delicious snacks.
Male: 100%, Male, have you ever craved an ever-evolving, dynamic music library within the confines of your portable music player? did you ever hear a song on the radio...and then wish you could record it on the spot...even if the song was almost finished? do you ever get bored with choices of your stale music collection on your ipod...and wish you had a better source for finding new music, that just isn't being played on the fm dial?
Male: 100%, Male, guinness is another beer with a pseudo cult following.  there are people that love the stuff so much they buy hats and shirts to let you know they like guinness.  guinness represent something of a different take on beer than most people are use to. it is dark and looks different. i guess people respond to that sort of anti-yellow beer sort of thing. i remember in my younger light beer drinking days i pretty much thought guinness was a horrible joke. why would anyone drink something that dark and heavy?
Female: 100%, Female, what is my end goal? to change something, somehow. or, at least, to understand better, mejor, and in a way that can contribute to some change being made. because if nothing gets done... so what? i don't want to have just gotten paid to write a big extra-curricular research paper that will do nothing for anybody. i write, this summer, to help myself next spring. i write, next spring, to help us understand. i write, now, for the joy of it, because i am in love with the process. because this is part of how i process, how i think, how i act. 
Female: 100%, Female, i thought the snitching phase had died down, but apparently not. because recently i've been hearing it all over again. and to be honest, i get sick to my stomach when i hear people say that! why would someone want to save or protect a criminal who has harmed or killed someone!? why should a murderer or someone who will harm again be allowed to? i mean someone help me out here! lets say the victim was your best friend, mother or your child. would'nt you want someone to come forward?
Male: 84%, Male, i have just finished reading no exit by william garvin, out now from harry godwin's arthur shilling press. garvin's poems are 'science fiction', but more than that they feel as though they're constellated from the debris or rather the 'glitter trails' of 'science fiction'. so the first poem begins 'strugatsky sequence. diary]' and there's a beautiful short poem called 'tarkovsky', in which the words are printed so close to the edge of the page it's tempting to believe in something missing, some clue that makes the poem less strange and haunting.
Female: 100%, Male, where am i? middle of no where? where is coffee shop? oh... no gps… first day, we spent all the day in a 15 passenger van. second day, we only prepare things, such as we went to wal-mart for foods, pray and get some tools ready for the school. we brought 363 dollars food. thanks for the campus ministry taxes free sponsor. i was impressed how abbey novak got everything ready by her own, especially meals for all of us and for all the kids who are invited to come.
Female: 100%, Female, some years ago before my mother had passed away she loved to bead and boy did she ever bead the most beautiful of pieces! i thought that today i would show you what she had made for me one st. patrick's day that i really treasure now.
Female: 100%, Female, jaden and i usually have our date night on fridays, so we just had one a few hours ago. as usually, it was a hit. jaden got to pick the date night agenda and he picked books and two pokemon movies. he asked if we could read three books together and he wanted me to watch two pokemon movies with him. well, he fell asleep halfway through the first movie. i ended up taking all 65lbs of him upstairs to his bed, but it was still such a success! he had the biggest smile on his face as he was giving me the 411 on charizard and pikachu.
Male: 100%, Male, las vegas—polaroid fans will be pleased with the company's new product line-up announced wednesday at ces, which marks the long-awaited return of classic polaroid instant film, along with a modern version of the onestep instant film camera. in addition, the company launched new instant zink ("zero-ink") digital products, including a camera and a printer. the company also showed off its new photo-sharing site, the polaroid gallery.polaroid will offer a modern version of the polaroid onestep camera, the pic 1000, available in a range of colors and based on the classic polaroid color 600 instant film to produce the iconic instant pictures with white borders. 
Male: 68%, Male, i guess there's not too much to say. there never really is. i'm stuck in an odd "other" realm where i have no time to invest in things that would further my own personal happiness but i have all the time in the world to sit and wish i was doing something else. i guess i'm spoiled, at least a little. after looking at my last credit card bill, yikes, i picked up freelance writing to fill the cracks my paycheck doesn't want to cover and, for the most part, it's working well. 
Female: 100%, Female, baby has officially graduated from embryo to fetus and has grown to about 1 inch in length. about the size of a medium green olive. his or her head is continuing to develop and take on more baby-like proportions. this week, tiny muscles are starting to form. this will allow her to move her arms and legs. it will still be awhile before i can feel it though!
Female: 100%, Female, this morning, i prayed the "prayer of faith" and i heard the lord's gentle voice said , "let it be so." and it was so . all day, i felt jesus touching me and to me i had felt a big difference in me. i felt the holy spirit all over me and it was so amazing. i kept on thinking jesus all morning and into the evening. the definition of faith is in hebrews 11:1. what made thought of jesus was this song "i could only imagine"
Male: 93%, Female, looking to add to your classical music collection? amazon.com is offering a free sampler of five chopin songs performed by vitaly marguilis and jura margulis. the sampler comes from the x5 music group, and was released on march 1, 2010. 
Male: 96%, Male,  gutter is a new magazine of 'new scottish writing.' i am delighted that i have a poem in their first issue. there are lots and lots of good things in the beautifully designed magazine, so go and subscribe please, here. it is very reasonably priced. 
Male: 100%, Male, sony announced the release date today for modnation racers: may 25. if you're wondering whether that goes for the playstation 3 or playstation portable version, the answer is "both." as previously reported, the title is set to launch on both platforms, simultaneously, and with similar feature sets. the title is carrying the torch of little big planet's "play, create, share" model, with the ability to create and share custom tracks.the blog also outlined the pre-order incentives for the game, which vary according to retailer. each of the "modded," mighty-mugg-style racers hails from a well-known sony franchise (above). gamestop pre-orders will receive kratos and his "kart of chaos." 
Female: 92%, Female, remember all those "annoying" things that women do? yeah, it occurs to me, as a woman who does precisely none of those things, that guys actually like that. but check it out, ladies: they're sneaky about it. they give it different names. 
Female: 99%, Female, i always thought that having a dream is stupid… because people always say, instead of keep dreaming, why can't you be practical?? stop dreaming and come back to reality! this is life!! well, what's life without a dream, eh? now i know it's ok to have a dream, no matter how unreachable or ridiculous it is :) even though i know some dreams are hard to reach, i'll still try my best to chase that dreams of mine. sure, maybe i might not be able to reach that dream. but hey, when i look back in my life, at least there won't be any regrets! because i'm a dream-chaser instead of a dream-crusher.
Male: 100%, Male, i have been toying over the idea of creating a separate blog for my technical wanderings for some time now. earlier, i had posted some technical posts on my main blog - www.abhishekontheweb.com, but, now, those seem out of place in a blog, which deals with more general stuff, like events, photography, articles (and whatever random thought comes in my mind). as, in the last few years, i have been working on various technologies, especially java based, i thought of writing about some of the technical ideas that i have been influenced by, technical issues i have been intrigued by, and the upcoming technologies that i am working on. and what better place than to have a new blog just for that. i would like to put in as much details as possible in my post, else this blog would defeat its purpose.
Female: 100%, Female, ugh! i cannot believe how late i am with this! we had such a busy week last week! we had something going everyday! needless to say i didn't spend much time on the computer. (that might be a good thing!) since we have already finished our first week of our 2 week menu i am just going to post this week's menu. i will do better next time! i promise!
Male: 99%, Female, when searching for a car seat, saftey was our number one priority. comfort was our second. the britax line of car seats delivers both. yes, they are more expensive than most of the car seats on the market, but once you experience them you will know why. they have the highest saftey rating in the industry, are built crazy strong, and are so comfy for your little ones. they are easy to clean as all of the covers come off and can be washed as well. 
Female: 99%, Female, after upgrading from my old manual toothbrush to a sonicare electric toothbrush i would never even consider going back to using my old and outdated toothbrush again. i actually enjoy brushing my teeth now and it does not feel like a chore to do. my teeth feel a completely new level of clean since the switch and i know it is working better when i go to floss and there is barely any food left behind after brushing between my teeth unlike before, although yes flossing is still necessary. 
Male: 81%, Male, ok fellas, hopefully all the stragglers have caught up and finished the first book by now! we have confirmed that we will have our first meeting saturday 12/12/09. do us all a favor and don't show up not knowing what the whole book is about because you didn't finish it. you might get voted off the island... our new book for december will be "holy lockdown", by jeremiah camara http://www.africanbookstore.net/proddetail.asp?prod=nf1401 http://www.amazon.com/holy-lockdown-church-limit-progress/dp/0974796700 the first link is from a black bookstore. support black business!! if that's not your thing their is also amazon. (don't worry, no one will know!)
Male: 100%, Male, the most hyped game of the year. the rivalry of the decade. two of the all time best quarterbacks. home field advantage on the line. there was no way the game could live up to the hype surrounding it leading up to sunday night. they didn't hype it enough. in what will go down as an instant classic in this now historic rivalry, the indianapolis colts came from 17 down in the fourth quarter to steal a win from the new england patriots, 35-34.
Female: 100%, Female, what have you been cooking and eating lately? it's been a while since i shared with you what i've been making so i thought it might be fun to share my latest adventure. first of all, i took a pasta making class a couple weeks ago at a place in waco called gourmet gallery. it's a cute little kitchen store and they also hold lots of classes where they teach you how to make things such as pasta, tamales, bread, mediterranean food, easter desserts...i mean it's quite the range of classes. it's amazing. the only negative thing is that it costs money to take these classes. (shocking, i know!) and often more money than i have.
Female: 100%, Male, i'm a sucker for bowling alleys. maybe because bowling alone is one my favorite books. maybe because ed (wikipedia entry or imdb) is one of my favorite tv shows of all time. maybe because i love the independence square. or maybe because michelle, the manager is awesome. maybe because the great paula sorensen works there when she isn't at the main street coffee shop and/or singing great songs.
Female: 75%, Male, 52 photowalks - i read about this project idea over here. the goal is to get out of the house once a week and walk around snapping photos. i'm hoping to do "themes" or "areas" for these walks and i have a list of ideas that i'm excited about - the difficulty will be finding time. my goal is to do almost all of these walks in the philadelphia area so at the end of the year, i'll have covered a decent amount of the city and surrounding area. i've posted my first one over here although i haven't decided on a format for these yet. more to come later.
Female: 100%, Male, i never really did fit into the italian schedule of things here. i usually did my sightseeing during chuisora, italian siesta time. i headed to the beach typically when everyone else was leaving. i went out to dinner generally hours before everyone else. i visited cagliari when it was literally empty. what can i say? i had to plan much of my biking around the heat of the day. the sun was too strong for me to sit exposed on the beach in the afternoon. and, i'm not italian.
Male: 54%, Male, the nfl hall of famer was one of the greatest defensive linesmen of our time when he played for the los angeles rams as part of the 'fearsome foursome,' and then embarked on a successful television career.
Male: 100%, Male, here's one comic-book adaptation i would dearly like to see - wes anderson's take on spider-man. it is a tale of love and photography, of responsibility and revenge; a film so arch it's practically humpbacked. for all that, the amazing spider-man is not as much of a stretch as it first appears. downplay those distracting crime-fighting elements and peter parker could easily take his place amid the ensemble cast of the royal tenenbaums and the darjeeling limited. he is, in short, a very andersonian antihero.
Male: 100%, Female, now that the zune hd is on sale, and the and the latest zune 4.0 software is live, we can definitively answer the big question: has microsoft finally caught up to apple in the realm of portable digital music players?after a full, hands-on, lab-tested zune hd review, we can safely say that the ipod touch is still the king of the hill when it comes to high-end touch-screen devices. even so, the zune hd is very impressive and goes a long way to redeem the zune name. besides the touch, it's easily the next-best mp3 player you can buy. if you want to live outside the itunes ecosystem, it should be at the top of your list.
Female: 100%, Female, i have flown with thai air several times and each time it has been fabulous. i always choose to fly with them even if they are more expensive than other airlines. they have great food, and a lot of it....be prepared for a minimum of 5 to 6 meals on your trans-pacific flight. stewardess's uniforms are always colorful and very beautiful.
Female: 100%, Female, so i've come to the dark side. well not really but i've bought my first dc comic. and anyone who knows me will tell you that i'm a marvel girl all the way. well i have gone and bought power girl. and i must say that i love it! it's really well written. the only thing i don't like is that they draw her with really big boobs. i mean really big boobs. but other then that, i really like the comic. it is on it's 10th issue this month and i would really suggest everyone to go out and read it. for once there's a good female comic. they give her attitude and don't make her this dumb blonde. she can defend herself and she has some spunk to her. she looks good but man she has some punch behind her. so i guess i'm kicked out of the marvel club house (i have borrowed that statement from the nerdy bird) but i'm ok with that. power girl is a good read. 
Female: 100%, Female, paula begoun is the creator and innovative force behind paula's choice skin care and cosmetics. she is the author of 18 best-selling books including don't go to the cosmetics counter without me, blue eyeshadow should be illegal, the original beauty bible, and don't go shopping for hair-care products without me. paula’s books have sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide.
Female: 76%, Male, i took my spare dab radio into work to listen to whilst i sort the stores out. and i had the misfortune to tune into planet rock. but, initially, i gave the station a chance to enlighten me for once. true to its' output, planet rock disappointed me immensely. 
Male: 100%, Male, i can still remember hearing about terrorist attacks against westerners in saudi arabia while i was in boarding school and wondering if my parents and brother and sister were alright. both my parents seemed to be vulnerable at different times to being in the wrong place at the wrong time. it was always such a relief to hear their voice after one of the attacks that got close.
Male: 100%, Female, in honor of fringe's april 1st return, it appears walter bishop is celebrating the day of fools by donning a ridiculous wig. or maybe it's just that walter's 'do is from 1985. yes, we will be having some bad 80's hair flashbacks in the upcoming mythology heavy episode "peter," as walter devles into his son's "otherworldly origins" with olivia. we'll also finally meet peter's mother (played by irish actress orla brady). for those fringe fans jonesing for a mythos fix, the spring return sounds like a first class ticket on a walter bishop acid trip. read on for more head-spinning spoilers.
Male: 100%, Male, wii sports resort is the follow-up game to wii sports - the original game that came with the wii console. the main differnece besides there are new games / activities is the fact that it incorporates the wii motion plus adapter. the adapter connects onto the bottom of the wii mote where the nunchuk would plug into. the new adapter allows for greater sensitivity of the wii mote, allowing the sensor bar and wii to pick up more of the actual movoements of the person playing the game.
Male: 100%, Male, so, one weekend we were sitting on top of the jungle gym when roger reached into his backpack and unveiled his most recent acquisition, the price tagger gun from his parents’ store. “this is the coolest thing in the world. i can stick a price on anything now,” he said, fiddling with the dial for a bit, then promptly tagging the jungle gym at 88 cents per can. “see? now if anyone wants to buy this jungle gym, they have to pay us 88 cents!”
Male: 100%, Male, that is showing tremendous relative strength, as well as there is a buy signal with our two other indicators. we use stochastic and on balance volume to confirm a move, and they both show buy signals. place a stop loss order under $16.00 and our target for this company is $25.00
Male: 100%, Male, i really think the show would be better if they kept the boys and girls separate until the top two. a two-hour show at this point is impossible to sit through, even with the help of tivo. tonight's comments from the judges were pretty good for the most part. my comments, in order of appearance:michael lynch is by far the best of the guys and will make it to the top few (although dialidol.com disagrees).didi was better than expected again. she's not my choice by a long shot, but is safe for at least another 3 weeks.casey was better this week, but i'm not sure how long he will last. his song choice was not right for him
Female: 100%, Female, in a medium saucepan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. stir in the turkey and flour. add the milk, and heat through. stir the turkey mixture into the vegetable mixture, and cook until thickened. cool slightly, then pour mixture into the unbaked pie shell. roll out the top crust, and place on top of filling. flute edges, and make 4 slits in the top crust to let out steam. 
Female: 100%, Female, over the past few years it seems like cosmetic companies come out with some new life-altering mascara every other week. i'm never the girl who's quick to run out and buy a new tube of mascara because i've found that plenty of them don't work at all or that they just don't give me the look i'm going for. even though i was blessed with a head full of thick hair, my eye lashes, it seems weren't so lucky. they are thin and they're barely noticeable without mascara. they also have a natural curl which is good because i don't have to use an eye lash curler, but it's also bad since the curl causes my eye lashes to look short and stumpy.the maybelline define a lash mascara has been on the market for a year or so and it's gotten great reviews in magazines and adriana lima endorses it. 
Female: 100%, Male, ok here we go. i am off the pip next friday. that is if i am still there. i found out in my 1:1 today that in addition to no more sick time, i have 7 hours personal time and 4 hours of vacation time. i am screwed!!! per my manager i wrote to hr to see what happens should i get sick. i think i already know corporate americas answer but i will let them humor me. there has to be a law against this but il being an at will state. so now i am not sure how much longer i will be working there. sad part i actually liked this job. starting to look now to leave on my own terms. insurance is going to be fun as usual but we shall see and we will survive.
Female: 100%, Female, i am swooning over this dresses on the newly discovered eve gravel shop. the shop is canadian based and sells the most wonderful items. the dresses are all i ever wanted for spring (and all year long). and the model photos are gorgeous! oh pretty dresses, how i pine for you! 
Female: 95%, Male, did not win on friday. in fact, only got one digit right. and another work week starts and it still counts what i do at work. as you can see i didn't "open the box" by playing those numbers. i guess i'm lucky! let's see if 2010 brings some surprises. not much news. did not get struck by lightning (yay), did not win the lottery (yay, not). anyway...we'll try again 
Female: 100%, Female, ever wonder how celebrities get such beautiful, glowing healthy skin? if they're not lucky enough to be born with it, like this hollywood mother-daughter duo, they must have some tricks up their sleeves … right? yup. and though we don't claim to be geniuses or anything, from what we've seen on the red carpet (and learned from the many skin care experts, celebrity makeup artists and top dermatologists we've chatted with), we know that healthy-looking skin starts before you ever pick up your foundation brush. before you ever try to cover up those dark circles and red or brown spots (aka sun damage and acne). you must first nip imperfect skin in the bud by first addressing something else: your uneven skin tone.
Male: 100%, Male, most photographers would balk at spending $2k for a fixed-lens digital camera, but leica has a large following, and the leica x1 ($1,995 list) will find a happy home with many of the company's devotees. like the leica m8 ($5,995 list), the x1 features an aps-c image sensor—the same size sensor found in much larger digital slr cameras, such as the editors' choice canon eos rebel t1i ($899.99, )—capable of producing d-slr-quality images. though leica priced the x1 at a fraction of the m8, image quality is still top notch. but when you compare it to cameras from other manufacturers, such as the lumix dmc-gf1 ($899.99, ) from panasonic, the x1 becomes much less attractive. though you won't find a camera as small as the x1 with comparable image quality, you can spend far less on larger cameras that offer more features, comparable image quality, faster autofocus, no shutter lag, interchangeable lenses, higher resolution lcds and hd video capture. 
Female: 77%, Male, our local public high school is pretty good. nice facilities, gang & drug problems that are either non-existent or invisible, and motivated teachers. my wife and i stay pretty involved in our kids educations. one of the things we do, when able and required, is to go over their tests with them to see where things went astray.
Female: 100%, Female, maybe it's because we've had a few warm days after an extremely hard winter, but i just feel so blessed and so happy. i know that god lives and that he loves me and my family. i'm so grateful that he blessed me with michael and my boys and also incredible parents, siblings, in-laws and friends. i love this beautiful earth and am so grateful that i know where all these blessings originate. i truly am grateful for all god does for me.
Male: 100%, Male, if arsenal get inter in the next round expect 180 minutes of squeaky bum time with little action. my flat mate (the united fan) reckons arsenal'll get bordeaux or cska moscow. obviously i won't complain if we do but one thing's for sure: if chelsea got through tonight they'd definitely have gotten one of those 2 in the quarters so let's all be grateful for that and keep our fingers crossed for a united-barca match up. if we can avoid them enroute we can make the final. since bendtner's late winner on saturday against hull the stat men have said that arsenal officially score the most late goals (after 75 mins) in the premier league. i think any arsenal fan would probably know that to be true too. i was stood watching the hull game in the pub and my girlfriend came in after work with about 10 minutes to go and asked if i'd be grumpy if we drew. we both knew the real answer but i said i wouldn't be. i was surrounded by grumpy gooners. that was until bendtner scored and the place went absolutely ballistic and it felt fantastic. dan, my other flatmate (the one without a club), was watching with us and as i looked around for him i noticed, what at first glance, appeared to be scuffle. in actual fact dan had been mobbed in his celebrations by two arsenal fans in their fifties. it was such a relief and the grin on dan's face as we left the pub was amazing. he said he was thinking about supporting arsenal and i told him that if he wanted to he was more than welcome but that disappointment is as much a necessity of being a gooner as faith in arsene wenger is. in truth i was dead chuffed. 
Male: 100%, Female, ....i'm going on a rant for a few minutes....here's my issue.... i understand that there are a lot of dead beats out there who don't pay child support after their divorce. but when someone is actually trying.........and not just saying that they are.......then should they really get a lot of crap of not being able to pay it? they may be making a truck payment......just barely by the hair of their chinny chin chin.......but if they don't make the truck payment they can't work, and if they can't work there's no possible way of them ever getting caught up on child support. it's not like they're taking the meager amount of money they are getting an blowing it on anything meaningless. they're actually trying to pay bills and do the right thing. besides being 400 behind isn't nearly as bad as being 1300 or more behind....like other people. the way i see it.....yes, child support is supposed to be paid...of course no one is arguing that....and there is no excuse for those who aren't even putting out the slightest bit of effort...but if someone is having a hard time...like the loss of a job and not getting anything in between but a few crap opportunities that wind up going nowhere....then shouldn't they be cut just a little slack? it's not like they lost their job because they stayed out all night drinking and couldn't wake up for work.....or decided to go to a bar instead of earning money.....maybe the company they worked for shit on them and they've had a hard time finding anything since. i think people should stop being so vindictive and appreciate the fact that their child actually has someone who is really trying to help support them and is busting their ass to try and make sure they will be able to catch up as soon as possible. and if people are going to throw "i need to buy groceries for your kid," or "i can't pay bills because you don't pay me," please be sure and leave out the part about trying to make it a point to go the movies, or out to eat, or any other outing at least once a week. if you're blowing your money doing those things, you can't be hurting that bad. you most certainly shouldn't threaten the other parent with loss of visitation to their child! yes the judge may have given you custody......but they're still the parent as well. you're not only hurting them but you will tear your child apart by using them as a weapon against the other parent!! the only reason that sort of threat should come about is if the child is not being taken care of or is in some sort of dangerous situation while under the supervision of the other parent......and never at any other time. i really hate hearing people do these things to other people. and for no other reason besides the fact they think it's a way to keep them under their thumb. some people think they have to have control of everything..........they need to grow up and realize that nobody ever has full control of anything. once they do that, they may be capable of being half way decent people.
Female: 100%, Female, ok so maybe my once a week isn't turning out the way i had hoped....but it's not like i haven't thought about blogging! i have. in fact! i kept a pink post it note going on what i needed to blog about. it's full. so this will probably be pretty long. first on the list: i don't have enough guy friends. i don't necessarily have a lot of friends. (real friends anyway). but i definitely think i need more male friends. less drama. more laughs. and they generally don't get upset when you haven't hung out "in forever". second: i got netflix!! i loooooove it!! seeing a bunch of movies i've wanted to see but haven't. and it's cheaper. plus i can watch stuff online (too bad i don't have internet....). which brings me to point 3. dexter. best tv show ever!!! omg. it's disturbing and intriguing all at the same time. brilliant. i'm obsessed. finished season 1 and am on episode 6 of season 2. i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes suspenseful dramas. but if you don't like the f word...maybe steer clear. it's shown on showtime and not cable so....but it's great!! fourth: have you ever felt like telling someone to suck it??? cause i have. a lot lately. i truly want to look at someone i can't stand and forcefully say "suck it." maybe throw in a bitch at the end too if i'm feeling really vengeful. i'm sick of the hypocrisy and dumb assed-ness. (<-totally made up that awesome word just now). but in all seriousness....i want a lot of people to pull their heads out their asses. fifth: i live next door to danville. it's a place for old people. it helps them find affordable housing and care and what not. but i think a lot of old/homeless people live in the building as well. anyway....either someone is about to croak, or they did b/c for the past week the fire dept has been there every night. i stand on the balcony and watch them. which brings me to point 6. wouldn't it be great if a firefighter looked up and saw someone watching them and decided to introduce them self and they fell in love and what not??? not saying me of course. it was just a crazy thought i had. then my next thought was, what a great novel! someone should get on writing that. stat.
Female: 100%, Female, my heart broke once i made a decision. i knew i could second guess my decision forever, so i promised myself not to dwell on it. we bought pikachu and brought her home. just like with the stuffed dogs, i wish i could have brought all the guinea pigs home and spoiled them like i am and will do to pikachu. it's only been two days since we brought her home, and i already can't imagine what it would have been like if i'd chosen the other guinea pig. guinea pigs are more like cats than dogs, in the sense that you have to earn their love. they're also prey animals so they're skittish and wary of humans. but pikachu is adjusting to her new life. she wouldn't eat the first day when we were in the room, but overnight she ate a little. now she's drinking water and eating lettuce and squeaking happily when we pet her behind her ears. when i was researching guinea pigs online, everyone who owned them and talked about them on forums and websites were really.. i don't know how to put it, but attached i guess? you can tell they think of them like family. just like people think of dogs like family, but maybe a little more obsessed. some people give their guinea pigs entire rooms instead of cages. but now i can see where they're coming from because i do love pikachu like she's family already. i doubt i'd ever have a room for guinea pigs, but i'm totally creepy guinea pig lady over pikachu ;) posted by caitlyndelaney at 12:34 am 0 comments tuesday, july 28, 2009 i'm going to get a guinea pig. one night, i randomly looked into getting some dwarf hamsters because i remember going to pet co. last year and thinking they were cute. i just want a small pet because i can't have a dog and i miss having a pet. the more research i did about dwarf hamsters, though, the less appealing they became. they're appartently not very tame and have only been domesticated for about a decade. they also are cannibalistic toward their young. however, i never wanted or looked into a guinea pig because i thought they were too big but i had heard great things about them. then i went to visit mike's sister nicki and she has one named yoshime. i'd never really paid much attention to her before, but i really fell in love with her. nicki let her out and let her run around and she was adorable. so then i started researching and mike even said he'd be interested in getting one now. i got really excited like a little kid and i got my hopes up. then we started talking about how our apartment building wouldn't allow pets. we thought about hiding it from them, but the landlords and maintenance burst into our apartments all the time unannounced so it would basically be impossible. i lost all hope, but decided to call anyway and check, even though our lease says "no pets at all. any pets found will result in an immediate fine of $1,500 and the pet must be removed." i called our apartment the next day, completely prepared. i had my confident voice and i had all my rebuttals ready. once they said no, i was going to tell them that i could certainly understand, but that i was willing to pay a pet deposit and that i would let them check up on the guinea pig at any time. however, i never had to use any of those rebuttals. the lady answered the phone and i asked if guinea pigs were allowed. she asked, "will it be in a cage?" and i said, "of course." and then she said it would be allowed. so then i decided that i'm definitely going to get a guinea pig. i'm going to wait until we move into our new apartment on the 21st. hopefully this isn't just a phase for me and a guinea pig will be a wonderful and friendly addition to the new apartment.
Female: 100%, Male, in the spirit of newborns arrivals life has been a little less planned and a little more hectic. one might say we have currently it all under control, but those changes day-to-day or night-to-night. however, on the average we all are currently above water. alex has been doing well though; gaining weight, growing, eating, and sleeping. nathan is a sponge. he is learning everything and anything. the explosion of words, sentences and thoughts has really begun in full force. his imagination really has kicked in and he trains, planes, and cars have places to go. as a parent, the little things are really the highlights: a middle of the night kiss on the forehead from nathan while snuggling him back to sleep, a toothless grin from alex while singing to him, measuring tape races with nathan on the kitchen floor, alex sleeping on your chest. 
Female: 100%, Female, today has gone well. i decided i can't just cold turkey quit smoking, so i've cut down a lot. i use to smoke a pack a day, but today i only smoked 3. so i'm hoping cutting down slowly will help me quit. i've had the taste of alcohol in the back of my throat all day but i've been fighting the urge to drink. it also helps that i moved into my mom and her boyfriend's house yesterday. they don't keep alcohol in the house. so that is helping a lot with the situation. i also moved to a new town which will be very helpful with my change. it will allow me to concentrate on it alot more. also i can make new friends that support my decisions. apparently there is a really good church here with a good youth group so i'll have to check that out soon. i'm hopefully going to be finding a job soon and getting my own car. this will help a lot with finding new friends.
Female: 100%, Female, the 4 stages of converse shoes i've been through a lot with my onverse shoes. i've warn them throught my liffe so i know what it is like and i know the features of when you get new ones. i recently got new ones and i just want to tell you the 4 stages from when you first buy the shoes and when you just cant where them anymore. haha 1. this is the first stage of your new converse shoes. when you first try them one they are like totally cool and new but they havent really fit in with the size of your feet. they can feel hard and very new. 2. the second stage is when the converse fit in with your feet. but they just start to squeak. i was walking bye in the hallways of my school one day and it startd to squeak, and i noticed that all my converse shoes have done that. i didnt like it. its kinda embarrassing. 3. this is probab;y my favorite stage. the squeak just gos away and it fits within my foot. 4.the last stage. i'ts wearing out and the the word all star has just disappeared. time to get new ones. those were all the stages. but theres one thing about converse shoes that i hate. every time i put them on i have to stick my finger in the shoe to get my foot in and my finger is like rubbing against the shoes and it hurts like really bad. well not that bad. hehe thanks 4 reading this.
Female: 100%, Female, so today, was long. i woke up early and finished an essay went to class not too lively of a day. but as i was walking home i heard a strange noise and as i walked closer to this man i noticed he was playing bagpipes. it was pretty interesting, i can say i have ever really seen someone play bagpipes in person before. now back to homework.so i have started classes again and to my amazement the three of my five classes all require course work to be done and turned in online. i am ok with this but the think that really irritates me is that each class uses a different website. one has motif one turnitin one d2l whatever that is. (desire to learn). and it doesn't stop there i need an iclicker. what the f*%k is an iclicker. incase you were wondering like i was an iclicker is a device used to participate in class. what happen to the good old-fashioned hand-raising, or class discussion. well thats it for now. i have to go register on my class websites. 
Female: 100%, Male, i enjoy occasionally going lingerie shopping with my lady, initially out of curiosity about why the heck they cost so much more than men's undergarments, but i soon developed a keen interest in finding the right lingerie for my wife, as a way to spice up my sex life. finding the right lingerie can be tricky; one person's cosmetic lift may be another person's dysfigurement. it is therefore helpful that a married man should occasionally take time out to go shopping for lingerie with wife, for her comfort, his libido (and money), their bond. the first step is to determine what shape her body is. is she a pear, a ruler or an apple? a pear is a figure that is curvy. it's larger in the hips than in the tummy and has a smaller top than bottom. "pears" generally have large thighs and rears as well. a ruler is a figure that is fairly balanced with little curve. most "rulers" are very slim women. an apple figure is one that is much larger in the chest than in the hips and thighs. a woman who is apple shaped usually has a bit thicker middle but slim, toned legs. so figure out which figure she has first in order to determine which lingerie style will flatter her body the most. once you've determined her shape, the next step is to explore the different styles of lingerie that work with it. you should have a good idea of what styles of lingerie you (you and your other half) are looking for before you go shopping with her. also be sure to shop at a nice lingerie boutique for the greatest selection and quality. 
Male: 71%, Male, and then they’d hang up on me all frustrated. like i was the idiot. like i’m running around town scratching the last digit off the phone number on the printed materials of hotels through the phoenix metropolitan area. some nerve i had, not taking their reservation over the phone for the hotel they didn’t call that i don’t work at. it started happening so frequently that i thought about actually just taking the reservations and letting them fend for themselves. hey, it’s not my fault they screwed up. but by the time i came to that resolution they stopped calling. i also used to get calls for somebody whose nickname was “golden boy.” this would not have been nearly as confusing had his real first name not been rich. hello? what’s up golden boy? what? is this golden boy? i don’t think so? is this rich? yes. rich gulden? oh. no. my dad’s cell phone number used to be 1 off from the towel department at bed bath and beyond. people called him on more than one occasion to get a conversation that went like this. 
Female: 100%, Female, everyone forgets that icarus also flew. it's the same when love comes to an end, or the marriage fails and people say they knew it was a mistake, that everybody said it would never work. that she was old enough to know better. but anything worth doing is worth doing badly. like being there by that summer ocean on the other side of the island while love was fading out of her, the stars burning so extravagantly those nights that anyone could tell you they would never last. every morning she was asleep in my bed like a visitation, the gentleness in her like antelope standing in the dawn mist. each afternoon i watched her coming back through the hot stony field after swimming, the sea light behind her and the huge sky on the other side of that. listened to her while we ate lunch. how can they say the marriage failed? like the people who came back from provence (when it was provence) and said it was pretty but the food was greasy. i believe icarus was not failing as he fell, but just coming to the end of his triumph. 
Male: 100%, Male, all of us have probably gone to school, or work with someone who is gay. we probably all got along well and probably still do. no harm came to us or anyone else around them due to their sexual preferences. we are fellow humans after all. the dislike that many exhibit towards them only starts once they make their sexual preferences public and for no good reason other than the fact that society, with its prejudices and ignorance teaches you to despise people inclined towards homosexuality
Female: 57%, Male, 4:04 am, los angeles. i was just shaken awake by what i thought was someone grabbing the bottom of my bed and shaking it up and down. i went down the hall to the reception desk at the comfort inn in monterey park and i looked at the night clerk who is usually asleep and said, did something just happen? yes, he replied. that was an earthquake. i went back to my room and called braff zackton who was already at work in chicago. braff ran his earthquake search that he does every 30 minutes and informed me that i just rode a 4.4 in the greater los angeles area at 4:04am. it seems no one else is alarmed but me! that is completely whack and a first for me. 
Female: 98%, Male, the optimistic meaning of life is what we all search for. isn't it? always the beauty of something so complicated, is put into such simple words, soul, love, life, understanding, acceptance. everything is so much more, you cannot express it in such simple words. everyday people die, and no one really recognizes, everyday people form and no one really recognizes it, and why? because were to busy searching for happiness, were all working, to get somewhere, where we think success is. people strive off of happiness, or the idea of it. its so hard to find, and often times people think they need to be rich and be very successful to be happy. that is completely irrelevant, happiness is inside of you, within you. when you are completely accepting of yourself, its when you can be happy by yourself, no help from others, to know that if everyone you know left you, you could still be happy at least a little, by yourself. i'm becoming happy again. katie day has helped me become happy again & i want to thank her for that. i just hope it last! i have learned that the people in your life the just wakes up one day and just leaves you behind and act like you dont mean anything to them and it really does make you feel so down in the dumbs you dont want to do anything! eat, can't sleep or even get to the point where you dont even dream good, thats when you just get up and learn to face the fact that they never have two shits about you. don't do what i have been doing, dont not eat, sleep, or even get to the point when you dont even want to do what you really enjoy. i ask you please! dont do this! just live you life like im learning to do again.
Female: 99%, Male, so this is it for another year - december 31st 2009. i don't want to spend for ever ranting on about how my year went....just a brief look back on some of the highs and lows. 2008 was a rough year. 2009 wasn't a whole lot better....but, it was better. i encountered similar problems in 2009 as i did in 2008, but felt that i dealt with them better. kept some of the demons at bay. this is partly due to the medication i had been on, effexor xr (antidepressant). after being depressed on and off since high school, i finally gave in and tried it. it helped a lot. i hope the black dog never returns but one must always remain cautious. sadly, 2009 was a year of confrontation. i don't consider myself to be a confrontational person but 2009 unfortunately had several war moments. confrontation with hannah, former student, confrontation with elsa, my ex girlfriend and confrontation with maree, my ex friend. i had made attempts to resolve these issues with scattered and limited success. no point going into them now, let god be the judge. 
Male: 100%, Male, so, over the thanksgiving holiday, when number one son was home from jhu for the break -- and after we dragged him (and number two son) to the mall -- and got number one a haircut (actually a trim) -- we wandered the mall as post-20th century consumer zombies are programmed to do. hell, somebody has got to keep the economy going. compulsively, i used the opportunity to inquire about my sons' ideas for christmas and birthday presents. number one son is transitioning into real manhood and after mentioning guitar legend (a campus rage), asked for a folding chair for his room, new pillows (as the university linens package ones suck), and a vacuum cleaner. number two mentioned various wii videogames that come out in february (sigh). my number one wife tried to get some group enthusiasm for zipping off to the movie theatre to see beowulf -- but despite the attraction of angelina jolie's frontal nudity (albeit "animated") -- we decided against what seemed to be an old english pre-quel to texas chainsaw massacre (well, not in texas and without chainsaws). so, upon passing by the saturday night matinee store, we wandered in to seek out some dvds to buy and watch at home. this is exactly the behavior that consumer market researchers adore -- "the impulse buy." number one son found "enemy at the gates" -- a film about the confrontation of a german and russian sniper during the battle of stalingrad in 1942. 
Female: 100%, Male, after a couple weeks on the job i had become like my 60-68 year old parents, waking up at 5:45 am and going to bed before 9 pm. my social life had been condensed to a quick after work joint with a buddy followed quickly by bed time. this is how i know that life isn't too short. when your doing stuff like this, you often think it couldn't be any longer. one weekend i had decided that it was time for max to play. i had been working my butt of and i wanted to party. so, i left work early one friday in order to catch a good nap before the evening in order to wrangle the necessary energy for later that night. when i got home everything seemed normal and i was able to quickly fall asleep on the sofa in front of the tv. i was awoken later that evening by my dad. he asked me if i wanted to go for dinner with him because my mom wasn't feeling up to it due to some nausea and she had suggested we just go alone. by the time i had showered and gotten ready my mom's condition had taken a severe turn for the worse. she was lying in bed sweating profusely and complaining of pain in her stomach and back. ten minutes later she was having trouble breathing and was very weak. needless to say, we canceled our dinner and took her to the hospital. by the time we got to emergency with her she was mumbling, sweating, and could not walk, let alone later hold herself upright on a chair. i had to carry her through the emergency doors, too weak to even hold her arms by her side, allowing them to hang down toward the floor.

Male: 82%, Male, i was watching a show on plane crashes. they were saying it's not one event that causes a crash but a series of events that leads to the crater. damn that sounds like my life! yah there's a lot of things we can do to hedge our peace of mind but what's the bottom line? our happiness or peace of mind because they're not the same. yah i could have got an mba bought a tire store in some corner of the world and lived out my life golfing raising five kids with the wife and making a difference in kawanis. if this is you god bless you. i've lived my life listening to that subtle whisper in me "keep asking more of yourself keep growing!" my art is humor my canvas my life. there isn't a single time i haven't been on stage that i haven't learnt something. i have chosen a life of pressure: corporate comic, comedy clubs, teacher, key note speaker but there are things i can do to guarantee results: keep finding ways to reinvent myself, keep looking at my goals and make sure my habits grow with them, keep re discovering ways to grow in my industry. i thought about the events that lead to a wreck. i can use this same criteria to examine my personal program. when i first began stand up my inner thought was panic. all my results came from that. panic was what i sent out and what i got back. my thought now is " let's explore follow me." my results are discovery and growth. if single events lead to result make sure your core thought is attracting the results you want. our core thought determine whether we fly or crash achieve our destination or stay stuck.
Male: 79%, Female, and when i speak german, i have to express myself in exactly the same way. i can't convey the dark subtleties of my inner-being to the person in front of me. i ask. i get. simple as. so naturally, my personality and view of the world, how others percieve me and how i percieve myself, changes automatically. when i visit a restaurant and my meal isn't quite right, i have to tell the staff, as clear as day, what's wrong with it. straight off. if i were in england, given the nature of our language, i would be ridiculously apologetic for any inconvenience i may have caused them. if i said roughly the same thing in german, the waiter would look at me quizzically and ask what i'd done to it. in english i "remember"; in german i "remind myself". in english, i am the height of politeness. in german, i am constantly apologising for things i haven't done - and therefore just a bit weird. and in french? i am a german - over-rolling my "r"s and sticking verbs at the end of sentences. the languages i speak: as much as i may try to contort the words into something understandable to a native, you can guarantee that the words are contorting me twice as much. foreign languages - the best and quickest way to contract multiple personality disorder, what say you? 
Female: 100%, Female, it has been more than one year from when i wrote my last blog. i require a lot of motivation to do this and of course a good reason as well. today i've got both to do this again. it's my 23th birthday, which is so specially to be cherished for the rest of my life. i had it in gottingen. although far away from family, i've got all the friends celebrated with me at the same time. messages from friends all over the world--- swiss, america, belgium, and france and for certain home. what's so surprising is the email from michiru who is a friend of mine in japan. despite the fact that she's been very busy with becoming a mother, she still remembers to send her best wishes just in time!! 
Male: 100%, Male, politics on tuesday? easy: repubs are the danger at this point, who on the right is still kidding themselves: republicans are not for actual medical reformation. they never have been. they want to keep their corporate medical sponsors (granted, it's been hard for the dems with their corp med sponsors too). but the 'pubs haven't put effort into anything except not putting effort into the reform americans are desperately in need of. wait, that's not true. repubs are putting a great deal of effort into scaring the hell out of the ignorant american populace that the (obama v. 2.1) usa is going to take over their health care. and kill us all! it's true. ask beck or limbaugh or any of those other conservative ass-clowns who claim an allegiance to a more pure form of american government than the republicans. and everything obama does is bad and wrong and is deliberately so. obama hates america! so the democrats have to go and the republicans who don't get the am radio stamp of whateverthefuck (most of them) all need to go. and by fostering that level of ignorant voting rampage, and ignorant tea party education, you foster a frenzy-dom of stupidity, a madness of idiocy, all of them suckling on the teat of talk radio like a crack baby on its amphetamine-laced lactation. right wing radio: you're right. america is in danger. america is in danger from you. you are fostering not an educated populace, but an ignorant one. you are fostering your dream of an oligarchy ruled by madness that fits your version of reality. you are the danger. and as disconcerting as it is, i say: bring it on. usher palin into 2012. kill reform without solutions. we'll be waiting. with facts. and you will lose. 
Female: 100%, Male, windy here this afternoon; gusts up around thirty-five mph. sitting here a bit back staring out my window, sipping a taste of wild turkey when i saw a cloud of newspapers sailing by. i ain't talking here about a few, but a goddam blizzard of them. i had a flashback to a year or so ago when i looked out there and saw a few thousand plastic grocery store bags flying around, most of which got hung up in my pine trees. remnants of some of them bags are still hanging around. carrying my glass of wild turkey, i strolled down to the road to see what i could see. what i saw was a vortex of newspaper raising from ms. graham's backyard and heading my way. i also saw ms. graham running around in the road trying to snatch her runaway newspapers out of the air. she wasn't having much luck. i like ms. graham, seventy-two year old retired school teacher, and subscriber to about nine newspapers, which, after reading, she piles in a stack on her back patio for a year or two. i walked on down to her. she was sort of shook up that her stash of newsprint was blowing off in a n/e direction and getting hung up on mailboxes, power lines, trees and such. i suggested to her it was not that big a deal; that newspaper would rot right into the ground pretty soon. "besides," i told her, "if i run out of toilet paper any time soon, i'll just go out and pluck some off my trees." you might think a seventy-two year retired school teacher wouldn't find that funny. you'd be wrong. 
Female: 63%, Female, ....nothing much to write about today. nothing has pissed me off, nothing making me feel like turning cartwheels. although, if i turned a cartwheel right now, it would probably end up in a trip to the emergency room and that would piss me off. i just felt like typing so random stuff floating around in my head is ending up here. is that how you spell babbling? for some reason it doesn't look correct, but spell check says it is right. hmmm? oh well. why is it the games dare likes the most are the ones with the most annoying sounds? why is he soooo good at them? i kinda miss the simple games i used to play. especially the one where you shoot at the gopher stealing carrots out of your garden. if you hit him he would say "ugh, i'm hit. going down." if you only came close he would jump up and down saying "what was that for you idiot?" and then flip you off. i missed on purpose often. drove my mom insane. 
Male: 100%, Male, you hear many vhristians claiming that their god is the absence of evil. they usually start their conversation with things like "dark is the absence of light" and "heat is the absence of cold". there is even the hoax letter that has been going around for years now about the student who supposedly one up's his mean evil atheist professor, using the very things said above. in some versions it is said that einstein did it, either way not only is it a fake and one of the worst christian arguments, it also provides one of the best counter arguments against such a god. i go over this in the form of a reductio ad absurdum in a previous blog, "a different look at the problem of evil", but lets form it into a direct argument against the god presented above. 1) god is pure good, the absence of evil. (matthew 19:17). 2) if god is the absence of evil, then evil exists only where god is not. 3) god is omnipresent, he is everywhere.(psalm 139:8, jeremiah 23:23,24) 4) evil exists. 5) therefore god does not exist so, either: 1. god does not exist or 2. god is not the absence of evil or 3. god is not omnipresent your thoughts? please be respectful in your debate. 
Female: 82%, Male, i always joked around whenever i heard roy orbison sing his "you got it" song that he would have to spend a lot of money. he says that anything his girl wants, needs, or anything, he would give it to her. i knew that he was just speaking metaphorically, but it was still a little humorous to think that she could sit there and go: "okay...i want a car, a yacht, a pony, etc." so, if roy was truthful, he would spend a mass of money on his girl. this song is dedicated to that mindset, and to all those guys in those types of relationships. let me just clarify: this, thank god, is not how my relationship is with my fiance. it is just the stereotypical relationship with girls.
Female: 100%, Male, sometimes things are perfect. when you find something perfect you then realize the other experiences you might compare to, you thought were perfect, weren’t. they might have been really good or above expectation, but not perfect. at 37 and a lover of food and restaurants i can count on one hand the number of perfect dining experiences. it takes a lot to pull it all together; location, atmosphere, food, drink, numerous employees that all have to be on target and in tune with you and your party. so here is the place i now get to add to my perfect spots: canoe. here are the moments i want to capture (and i will not go through all of them as there many more highlights): the grounds were beautiful. i know, grounds. i come from southern cal where grounds are the parking lot and the shrubs in front. canoe is on the chattahoochee river in atlanta georgia, nestled in a community of incredible estate homes. there is a walking path that winds through lawns with lovely flowers and plants all under the shade of mature trees. they even had set some tables out on the lawn for a small party of 4 couples. they were right next to the water front a good 50 feet from the back porch of the building. while i was there they set up the tables and seated the 8. they seemed to really enjoy themselves and it was hard not to be impressed with this extra effort of having the wait staff travel the distance. 
Female: 100%, Female, for example, there was a friend who was committed to some guy. and then we happened to ask this girl whether she was sure that this was the guy she wished to be with even after say, 10 years. the answer was 'no'. then, why? the question is why? why do people stick with people, get into a relation, have fun, and then break up? i don't say that all people are the same, and many of them are faithful, but there are many who are not. and even if we recognize the true colours of people, why do we keep passing on time in futile? time pass? is that the motive of all this? love is so fuckin' blind? are we stupid? yes. amen. there was another guy who claims that he had a break up with his girl because that girl hated his doggy and hence, she dumped him. now. where is co-operation? adjustment? what is love? 0_o people might ask me to ease down a bit, and take things a bit lightly. they might tell me that i am too serious about life. but hell, atleast i think a couple of times before wasting my time on something or someone. why holler around with something or someone with no purpose what-so-ever? another example: friend showing all the smses of a drunk lover: "ohh maan...your hazel eyes...and your lips...blu blu..bli bli bli...bla bla..." she laughed at him. and i laughed back loud like an immature oaf. and it seems to be a claimed fact that at the peak of teenage, you are supposed to take the opposite sex a bit lightly. every romeo, every cribbing lover happens to be a bastard within with verses of satan running through his blood. ahan. we girls(i mean, my species of girls) don't like it when a guy just uses the ladies and we love the 'one man for a life time'-and-the-blah-blah philosophy. but there are girls who can bet on their life to claim that we have to be treated the way we are being treated right now. a girl herself told a guy, that this is the age where we are supposed to know how the opposite sex is, and just hang out with her, and do 'time pass', and not to get too serious about her(say, expert guidance in misguiding the people trudging on right paths). alright, everyone seems to be stuffed up with the same shit. not cool. this seems so correct to most of the people, surprisingly. but for me, it seems so utter rubbish. seems like some unwritten law. not cool. it's crappy and unnerving.
Male: 96%, Male, early 20's and just moved from the small town to the big city. i have two jobs working in sports radio as well as at a college sports tv station in the greatest city of all, chicago. college graduate of north central college, class of 2008. high school graduate of coal city high school, class of 2004. not a whole lot else to know about me. although i no longer play any actual sports i do enjoy pick up games of basketball and 7 on 7 football as well as being the best 16" softball player in all of chicago. any other questions, ask me. 
Male: 100%, Male, have you ever wondered what is your purpose, beyond "what god has in store for you" or whatever your religion says. some people would say to make better in the world, but others really don't believe they have much of a purpose. my thought is that its genetically ingrained into us to drive on to do whatever is in our power to keep the race alive. in essence we're clinging to life like some sort of single-celled life form, such as a disease. all that disease does is travel from host to host until it dies. our "hosts" are what drives us to strive onward, for example: money, drugs, sex, the people we love, whatever you want. with that comes darwin's theory of evolution. if we just keep reproducing, theoretically after maybe millions of years we'd evolve to adapt to what would be essential for survival. that leaves the question... is there a 'perfect specimen? could we attain a level of never needing anything to survive and if so, would that mean immortality? it's an interesting question, something to ponder upon. once immortality is achieved, the primal need to survive will have been fulfilled. and we are still left to wonder, what is our purpose? 
Female: 100%, Male, well, here i am, back at home sitting in my favourite chair. back to normality, whatever that may be. the good news is that i did manage to drag myself out of bed at a sensible time, and even had enough time for some breakfast before we left the flat for the last time. we did go for one last look at the beach before we jumped in the car and began the long journey home. i drove for the first hour and a half! as far as scotch corner services in fact. this is, i think, the longest i have ever driven in one go, my previous longest being the hour from our house to derby. i thought i did pretty well, and i only managed to scare sally once - well, the bloke in front shouldn't have braked while i was checking the mirror should he?! saly drove the rest of the way home, and we got home around 2pm, which was earlier than we expected to - 4 and a half hours in total - a good 30 or so minutes less than we thought it would take - mind you, in the 90 minutes i spent driving we shifted a bit!! ;-)
Female: 100%, Female, i don't wanna get hung up on details, or this thing could get long and complicated, so i'll start with some highlights. christmas morning was lovely and peaceful. the boy is sweet and gracious, and he was so good all day that i'm still not sure it wasn't a coma dream. or that ward drugged him... i know for sure though, that drugged is the way to celebrate, as a started getting hit with a cold on wednesday night, and dosed myself with dayquil all day yesterday. it slowed my mind just enough that it was like i was watching a home movie. it was marvelous, really. 
Male: 96%, Male, i think that the book of job was written for this very reason. here we have a man who is deeply blessed of god. things have gone so very well for him. and suddenly it all goes wrong. not just slightly but deeply and in every way. has he done wrong? has he been spurned by god? no! job is never able to see the heavenly things. he is never shown the events of satan's desire to tempt, and test job. he is not shown god's pleasure in job's upright living. he is never shown any of these things. but he is called to trust that god is in control no matter what. he is in control and powerfully good even if our feelings are wrong. it is a beautiful test to be given the opportunity to have faith even in the depths of this dark night of the soul. we are called to yell out like job from the ashes. "he said, “naked i came from my mother’s womb, and naked i will return there. the lord gives, and the lord takes away. may the name of the lord be blessed!” in all this job did not sin, nor did he charge god with moral impropriety." (job 1:21-22) why do we think that just because he doesn't feel close that he is not close? why do we place so much emphasis on feeling? as if it was the deciding factor in our salvation, or god's relationship to us. 
Female: 100%, Female, sometimes i feel like willie lohman, only i'm much happier. i've been on the road since the end of february. i flew to bwi (baltimore international airport), spent a night or two with friends in dc, and then began my journey down to south florida. after an 8 hour drive i spent the night in st. george, sc. after a morning of not taking advantage of the free processed food , but loving the free treadmill, i ventured on down to daytona, where bike week was in full swing. friends had rented a gorgeous house in an old neighborhood, with huge oaks and pines and imaginary bobcats. the minute i entered florida on hwy 95 i was engulfed in nostalgia. i remembered walking hand in hand with paul on the mayport beach at the intersection of canal and atlantic. we later took the same walk when i was pregnant and we conversed about how excited i was to be introducing a soul to our wayfarer lifestyle with all it's beauty and spontaneity. in daytona, my girlfriend & i visited the legendary iron horse saloon, it is what i refer to as "thunder dome". again, i was taken back to another year, another time, pre- adrian. it was the year 1999 when i first entered this bar with it's multi level swing bridges and burn out pits and i knew for sure that tina turner would come swinging down any minute. my next stop took me to one of the equestrian capitols of the world. it was great seeing old friends and catching up. my greatest fun, was visiting nicky. i trained nicky to take over my job as a shore excursion tour director for the cruise ships in st. thomas in 1999. she was then my boss as the atlantis submarine, a real submarine that took 54 people down 90 feet to a fed coral reef. nicky now works as a director for a privately owned cruise ship for the elite billionaires of the world. we had a blast. she's from whales and we are comfortable enjoying a good cuppa. i'm staying in florida longer than expected. weather and expectations may be better. traveling for hours at a time with no dial on the radio worthwhile, with lots to ponder and a journal for contemplating. when the day is done it is satisfying and rewarding. good friends, good memories, lots of self exploration. 
Female: 100%, Female, what else? hmmmmm....oh, i had an interesting string of conversations with alyssa recently. apparently my aunt snapped a couple weeks ago and sent aly the longest email ever as an attempt to make amends with her. they haven't gotten along for years and years. alyssa was so upset by the email that she sent it to me for some advice. it was such a slap in the face. i talked on the phone with her for over an hour, two different days. actually, both days i ended up sitting out in my car in the driveway. that is my weird solution to preventing myself from pacing when i'm on the phone for a long time. eventually our conversation got away from the bullshit with her mom and we caught up about everything else. alyssa is yet another person that i can talk to about anything. i guess i'm really lucky in that way. why is it that so many great conversations take place while in the car? maybe it's just me, but i've had some friendship-changing conversations on a late-night drive on a long road. i have a really fun week ahead of me. i'm seeing my very first broadway show, and i'm taking a roadtrip to a place i've never been before. hopefully some of the things that i've ordered as christmas and birthday (and baby shower) gifts will start showing up in the mail. i want a better idea of the dent i've made in my holiday shopping. ok, soooooo, yeah. i guess that's all for now. 
Female: 100%, Female, even when i first started, the lunches were much better than your average school lunch. the kitchen exclusively served organic milk and yogurt, and the salad bar always had lettuce, tomatoes, and other fresh vegetables. even with a few great items in the cafeteria, it still has a long way to go. the majority of students and staff eat food from the main meal line, and the food is just a small step up from an average school lunch. hot dogs, hamburgers, nuggets, and pizza are monthly mainstays. yes, the hot dogs might be lower sodium and the buns are made with whole wheat, but healthy and nutritious, they are not. before taking this job, i worked in a few upscale restaurant kitchens as a cook, pastry chef, and sous chef. i rarely cooked at home, and i ate pretty poorly during those years. it made me wonder why i was cooking in the first place. i would never have guessed i would end up working in a school cafeteria five years ago. new york city was just beginning to revamp its school lunch program when i was finishing up culinary school. they were hiring at my culinary school’s career fair. i was interested, but i didn’t linger at their booth too long. why would i spend two years of my life learning to cook and then work for a school, where little cooking is done on premises? several years later and exhausted from twelve hour days feeding a select few restaurant-goers, i began to think about school food. i heard more and more about people like alice waters and ann cooper. i taught a free cooking class for high school students and their stories reminded me how bad school lunch can be. at some point, tackling a stagnant school food system seemed much more interesting than making truffle risotto day in and day out.
Female: 100%, Female, this morning i gave someone a gift which spread a smile across their face. that was the best feeling ever, to know that making a small amount of effort would improve their day dramatically! i am of course talking about mother's day. today i gave my mum a 2ft card and a small teddy bear (which she's now called aristotle..!), and the smile that came on her face was brilliant :) i'm really glad she likes it, and today things seem to be a lot more on the up for her, which is a relief considering last week. as for myself, well today is another day of normality. i'm dying for a week saturday to come, when unbelievably huge deadlines are out of the way. every night of this week is going to be dedicated to making some form of draft of my dissertation. i know fully well it won't be anywhere near the standard my final draft will be, but heck, why not make the effort and get some useful feedback. i got a 2.2 for the dissertation report that i did, which was 20% of my overall dissertation grade. granted, it was a low 2.2, but heck, it could've been a 3rd! so that's given me a bit of a boost. i know fully well my stress levels will go through the roof this week because of my work, but i'll manage hopefully :) and the weekend will bring some much needed relaxation and giggles! 
Female: 100%, Female, recently, spm resultt released. those people around me, have a great result. this make me stress. i stress, not because i scared and hate the feeling of lose. i stress as i don't want to disappoint my parents. they have been putting a lots of hope on me, since i get i a great result at kinder garden. it also mean, my childhood is in stress. though, i appreciate what they have done. thanks mum, dad. although stress, i suppose i will go through it by myself. i will try my best to not disappoint u all. bro, thanks for your support. you are the best brother in the world. spm,me, rainie, never scare of you. as what asson say, angel is always by my side. 
Female: 100%, Female, i've been running this off and on cold for three days now. it started with immense fatigue and soreness, so i thought it was the flu, but then it never digressed into upper-respiratory torture? then on saturday it was nonexistent, then today i feel sick again (but still no nose slobber). maybe it's some order of slow burning swine flu that in a week or two will finally come around to making me do my sickness hibernation techniques. so i have my very own apartment now and all of you should be fucking proud of me, because other than that one time in asheville (some of you may affectionately remember the hemp-hill home) i have never done this all on my own before. and i do mean all on my own, down-posits, rent, contracts. talking to them. you know, stuff adults do. i'm going to paint the walls purple and put those glow in the dark stars on my ceiling. christmas lights will be a-plenty. i already have some dank smelling candles from ikea that stank up the apartment like crisp cinnamon apple (and now it smells like a thousand cinnamon orgasms). i live in nw balls deep in the city and i wouldn't have it any other way. 
Female: 100%, Male, this concludes that the most caring doctor in town is one suffering from multiple problems him/herself; it doens't make the doctor the most capable, but certainly most empathetic. i am one. eeerrughhhhhh! *retches* oh thats my breakfast looking blended!last night hanging out with friends was awesome! derek and i cruised through our alma mater, went to the mall, cruised back through, told stories, laughed, had genuine great conversation, and then met friends for pizza. it was awesome. i saw people i hadn't seen in years. my abs hurt this morning because i laughed so much yesterday. i think derek is the funniest person i know. and that was amazing. and then today i get a letter in the mail from unemployment. i've been denied benefits. fml. and tonight we're getting together for an "i have too much alcohol in my house and you all should come drink it" party at my friend katie's house. so...it's perfect timing.
Female: 100%, Female, i am honored that my painting “the divine mother” (4' x 8', acrylics) has caused such controversy. the theme of the 2007 artery exhibit in eureka springs, ar was icons, and i chose to paint what i believe to be one of the most beautiful and inspirational iconographic themes that transcends the world of art to include the history of mankind— the simple and beautiful image of a woman breastfeeding her child. the judges at the portfolios.com creative awards, an international competition, also found this to be beautiful and gave me an award for this painting (illustration '08). since ancient times, people have been so inspired by the beauty of this image that incredible myths and religious stories and artwork have been created, even worshipped. this includes depictions of the egyptian goddess isis breastfeeding baby horus, an ancient myth which bears striking similarity to and which many scholars say inspired the madonna del latte or maria lactans imagery of europe, which reached the height of its popularity in the middle ages. i title my painting “the divine mother,” though it is not a depiction of the virgin mary, as many people erroneously believe. the virgin mary is just one divine mother icon of many; my divine mother is one of unity, love, gentleness, compassion—and so she combines world traditions and religions, transcending time and space, melding pre-christian religions with christianity to be an icon we can all identify with and find peace and beauty with. look closely at her face—it is half-blue (many egyptian statues of isis are blue) , and she is wearing egyptian makeup. as many people have noticed, i put a new twist on this subject by adding the text “does this halo make my face look fat?” to the painting. the madonna lactans and isis imagery began as a way to show the compassion of the divine mother and therefore to make her more real, human, and accessible to us. adding the text was my attempt to refresh and modernize this theme—to make her accessible, relevant, and real to a modern audience. the divine mother, in all her forms, is undeniably the greatest supermodel of the art world since the beginning of mankind—so i believe that like you, she worries about how she looks in a painting, photograph, or sculpture!
Female: 100%, Female, a question for god looms in my mind like water rolling and spinning; chortling into an abyss of time. when i was nineteen i was dying so that i could live. i survived this challenge to come through this lifetime with the knowledge that god is within. i was a college student, home for the summer and had gone to a party. at that party there was drinking and pot smoking. a good friend’s boy friend had come on to me and i was tempted to flirt back. in fact, i did flirt back. i was young. i was beautiful and i was an atheist. a year earlier my longest childhood friend had a swimming pool accident which left her a paraplegic. my friend, the athlete was changed forever and i felt guilty. it was the unreasonable kind of guilt that summons over the young just because it can and it did. my friend was changed and i too changed. i grew angry, and in a way i became uncaring about life itself. i learned years later that often when we have profound thoughts they can manifest into reality. my thoughts at that time were, “why didn’t it happen to me?” that night of drunken partying with a cute boy who was supposedly attached to a good friend i got into my car to drive home and through no fault of my own was hit. suddenly my car flew out of control spinning around and around in the darkened summer night. i sat in the driver’s seat with voices going through my mind of my father and my brother, “don’t do this....do that!” paralyzed i began to pray, “dear god! i don’t know what to do! help me!” in that moment i gave up my arrogance and went into complete surrender and when i did that an extreme and blinding white shield of light came directly out of my chest surrounding me like an egg shell. the car continued to spin and finally slammed into an apartment building narrowly missing a telephone pole. i jumped out of the car mainly to see if i could still walk. my car was totaled, but i was okay. the man who had hit me had been “joy racing” with another driver going over 90 miles per hour and i had inadvertently gotten into his way. 
Female: 100%, Female, being that my school is on a year round schedule, there is always one "track" of kids not at the school for a few weeks at a time. though i like the sporadic breaks here and there, a small void is always felt for those fellow teachers you work with that are gone for a few weeks. so a few times this school year, a group of my work friends have met up at the cheesecake factory for random visits with friends that we have been missing at work. last week, a cheesecake factory trip was planned for this week to play catch up with some of our dear track 4 (off track) teachers. . . or so i thought. . . i should have been a little suspicious when one teacher wished me a happy birthday today at work. . .." uhhh thanks. . . but a few weeks late! where are you getting this information?" well. . . my brain got a thinking, and sure enough. . . i found myself at cheesecake factory dinner not in honor of missing our friends (though i think that is still a big part of it), but rather for a happy birthday shawna dinner! the food was good, the dessert was even better, but the company was by far the best! these ladies have truly become some of my favorite people that i can go to for a laugh or a cry during a time in my life where i have no super close friends in proximity. today was by far a rather crappy day at work, but who can understand what im going through better than this group of people? they really know how to make a person feel much better about themselves. who would've guessed that a two week late birthday dinner could be such perfect timing?? by the end of the night i even got one of them to agree to become a garbage man with me as long as i drive and let her ride the back! awww. . . now that's what friends are for! 
Female: 100%, Female, having mono during school has been really difficult for me. i am constantly tired. not only is it hard for me to wake up in the morning, it's hard for me to find the motivation to go to class, study and get work done. the doctor said the fatigue could go away in 2 weeks and it could last for 3 months. it's been almost 3 weeks and i feel just as tired as before. i can already tell that this is not going to be a dean's list semester. i'm disappointed with myself, but i feel so helpless. i can't even ask my teachers for a break because uhs won't give me permission to miss any classes. not only is my academic life suffering, but so is my social life and my emotional well-being. i don't have the energy to straighten my hair any more and my self-esteem takes a hit every time i look in the mirror. i think the huge bags underneath my eyes are permanent. the apartment is a mess too, which i can't live with. cluttered house, cluttered mind. you're supposed to lose weight with mono, but all i can do is sit on the couch and i'm not allowed to exercise, so i fear i'm gaining weight. i need to turn this around. this is a challenge. if i got dean's list this semester, i would be incredibly proud of myself. i know i shouldn't be straining myself, but i need to push myself because right now, i'm not really pushing myself at all. 
Male: 100%, Male, i understand that while the first few days might be typical for a class, it shortly becomes their hardest and most grueling block with the pure mass of data they require you to learn. this weeds out anyone that can't handle the workload right off, and anyone who is not serious about animation. it also gives student a good strong base to start with the 2nd block, which i understand to be mostly animation and mocap. i think 3rd block covers the more advanced features, like visual effects and green screen. and finally, 4th block is one big long class project. students have very limited creativity in the class assignments. while they are encouraged to come in before or after class, and on weekends, to work on their own projects, so they can build their demo reel up and their skills, the class itself acts more like an actual animation studio, where the directors call the shots, and the animators have to make it happen. therefore, we have to act like animators to make their vision come true. students will have some limited creativity within each shot, but the majority of it is just to make the scene work the way it should. 
Female: 60%, Female, as i've been gleefully exclaiming to all and sundry on my youtube channel, yesterday i went for some afternoon tea (the very phrase conjures pomposity unlimited and therefore regally requires capital letters) at a very posh hotel in london with an intimidating dress code and a price list even more so. so finally, after a lot of to-ing and fro-ing and wandering about the flat in semi-constructed and poorly-considered outfit choices, we finally managed to mobilise our troops and begin our expedition to somewhere a little different. i held kiwi's hand as we nervously shuffled past the doormen of the connaught hotel and crossed the threshold, half expecting to be rebuffed by a cross-looking moustache in a top hat and tails, or for the unsmiling host blocking our entry to our desired destination to tell us that we were unsuitably attired, or our reservation could not be located. feeling none of the bravado of red riding hood, i felt a little lost in the woods as we were ushered to a seat and sat down before my seat was pushed in. luckily there was no slapstick tumble to the floor, rather an awkward pause as i calculated the distance between myself and the table, and the danger of dropping one of those so-carefully prepared pastries into that unavoidable gap. i stood up awkwardly and let the nice lady with the grey suit push my chair in a little further.
Female: 100%, Female, there's so much to say. every little nuance of life becomes exaggerated when you're in the hospital. every interaction becomes multiplied in meaning. every small exchange between me and the saviors-in-scrubs became a desperate reliance on their expertise and kindness. i feel like the hospital is the gateway from death into brith and life into death. i was born in one and i've been near death in many. my hospital visits for my various illnesses and surgeries are like the punctuations in my rambling life. yesterday's surgery went well and by well i mean my knee should be improving and i didn't die. my surgeon explained the "mess" my knee was in. there was the "fracture" in the cartilage, fairly new (happened 11 months ago) that needed to be cleaned up. then there was the bone-on-bone arthritis that had to be dealt with. meniscus shavings were all over the place causing pain and inflammation. he cleaned up what best he could. we'll be doing protein injections in about a month to ease the arthritis. i'm optimistic. the pain is pretty bad but i have plenty of pain killers. i was urged to take them and to get rest. no need to be the tough-guy by not taking the meds. see, pain is a signal to the body that something is wrong. pain puts the body in crisis mode. fight or flight crisis responses do not facilitate healing. taking the pain killers and resting tells the body that it's time to heal. now if only i would stop fussing around the house and get some rest!! 
Female: 100%, Female, the second man fumbled with his hands as he stood behind his friend. i realized the second man was mentally challenged and the blue-eyed gentleman was his salvation. i held my tears as i stood there with them. the young lady at the counter asked him what they wanted. he said, 'coffee is all miss' because that was all they could afford. (if they wanted to sit in the restaurant and warm up, they had to buy something. he just wanted to be warm). then i really felt it - the compulsion was so great i almost reached out and embraced the little man with the blue eyes. that is when i noticed all eyes in the restaurant were set on me, judging my every action. i smiled and asked the young lady behind the counter to give me two more breakfast meals on a separate tray. i then walked around the corner to the table that the men had chosen as a resting spot. i put the tray on the table and laid my hand on the blue-eyed gentleman's cold hand. he looked up at me, with tears in his eyes, and said, 'thank you.' i leaned over, began to pat his hand and said, 'i did not do this for you. god is here working through me to give you hope. i started to cry as i walked away to join my husband and son. when i sat down my husband smiled at me and said, 'that is why god gave you to me, honey, to give me hope..' we held hands for a moment and at that time, we knew that only because of the grace that we had been given were we able to give. in my own way i had touched the people at mcdonald's, my son,the instructor, and every soul that shared the classroom on the last night i spent as a college student. 
Male: 100%, Male, for those of you who thought luke harangody was bound for nba greatness and never going to play a game for the fighting irish again, you were wrong. after testing out the nba routine, working out for a few different teams, harangody has decided that staying in college is not such a bad idea after all. i'm not going to say that this is a great move either way for #44. what i do know is that his lack of defensive ability would have severely hurt his potential minutes on an nba court next winter. he has proved that he can score in the big east and grab absurd amounts of rebounds. however, he needs to be more of a defensive threat if he hopes to play in "the league" for any extended amount of time. i'm not bashing luke harangody, the kid is one helluva college basketball player who has been as good as any in the big east over the past two seasons. his body size puts him at an extreme disadvantage for a big man in the nba in terms of being able to back down opponents and score the same way he does so often in big east play. the good news for fighting irish fans is that in the big east even you are able to get away more with some of the flaws that nba souts see in harangody's game and that next year should be another outstanding offensive campaign for the fighting irish forward. 
Male: 100%, Male, i figured while i was unemployed, i would try to do something useful. one thing i thought somebody might benefit from was a facebook page that gives advice on finding a job. (here's the link) then i thought about the things going through my mind these days as i struggle to stay positive and engaged in the face of a job market that isn't exactly smiling upon those over 40. finding a job in this economy is tough for anybody, but being over 40, you might start asking yourself things like, "do they think i'm too old to do this?" well, listen, now you have a chance to prove to them that you are capable, talented, and right for the job. some people develop a lot of negative self-talk and that negative attitude begins to show through on the surface. not many employers can afford to hire someone who is late to work, can't spell, doesn't produce results, has so much drama in their life they aren't present at work, etc. so you're still in the game, old-timer! i created the over 40 unemployed facebook fan page as a place where people (you don't have to be over 40 and unemployed) can share their experience, their strategies, their job search tips, and their success stories. i believe that in this economy, if you're over 40 and unemployed then all the more reason to work harder and work smarter. it's a chance to show how all those years of "experience" can benefit a potential employer. and here's the logo i created for the over forty and unemployed facebook page:
Female: 99%, Female, well i was just sitting here wondering what the next step is. anybody that knows me will tell you that i'm a person who likes things planned out. but at this time in my life i am not the one in charge of making the plans. i have met a wonderful guy who treats me like gold. but when will he ask me to be his wife? i have gotten my diabetes under control. but when will god make me a mother? i have worked so hard on getting to this point in my life i just wonder what's the next step?
Female: 99%, Male, today was an absolutely gorgeous day... i aerated much of the lawns and over-seeded them as well... i will finish in the morning. i wanted it completed before saturday as we will go from 60's back into the 30's with rain and a possible snow storm. there is way too much to water in the seeds and i will have to leave that to spring rains. i'm not particularly concerned about the cold, as magnolia buds don't appear to be swelling... at least not yet. i thought i'd talk a bit today about fall planting....why plant in the fall? the answer is a simple one... deals, deals, and more deals!! ... and when the deal isn't to my liking, i simply say... 'let’s make a deal'... and frequently they do. let's discuss this past fall for instance. below is a whole lot of plants that i got for 50-75% off. this particular nursery was having a sale and not discussing lowering the prices any further.... but they were cheap enough to spur me into the purchase. the downside is that there was no warranty... then again, i seldom lose a plant that has been carefully chosen. a good shot of rooting hormone and they seem to take right off! 
Female: 100%, Male, bella is over the chicken pox. she returned to school today. all said, it was a very manageable case. not super-mild, but not super-bad either. perhaps it took having the chicken pox to nudge bella over the edge of readiness to ride a bike without training wheels. in the midst of the pox, she asked me to take the training wheels off. she practiced coasting in the driveway. the next day, she was getting the start-off and some wobbly pedaling down. yesterday, she had nailed it. she's still perfecting the brakes, but she has completely mastered the start-off, pedaling, and steering. now it's time to get her a bigger bike. as you can see in this video, hers is too small. i'm not sure if she'll get one for ayyam-i-ha, which is less than 2 weeks away. it might wait till her birthday in june. although with us packing up to move, she might get a "bike coupon" for her birthday, redeemable in whatever city we move to. 
Female: 100%, Female, i want this on my body, i want a tattoo, i want a lot of tattoos. first of them has to be a simple heart on my right foot to carry on a simple tradition. ya see my best friend from the age of about three is going to carry on the tradition of the "foot heart tattoo" or whatever it is and i have agreed to embark on this with her. so i cant start my ink filled journey without her.. the journey should start soon... hopefully. so with no direction and the never ending search for a career path growing more and more difficult i have decided to vent.. to blog. a bit about myself i am a student, studying who knows what at this moment. transcript says in store for my next semester is french, sign language, english 300 and 302 magic, witchcraft and religion, and fitness. we'll see how that goes. i have a strong passion for languages, and culture. i would love to be a reporter, or a medic, a translator, a psychiatrist, i'd love to do it all. first i have to settle on a major, at the moment i am thinking a double major in communications and international relations. or linguistics. this is going to be harder than i thought.. well i that's it for now i have to call it a day i have a job interview tomorrow. wish me luck. 
Female: 100%, Male, one of the reasons is that we are all different. when we hear someone telling us something difficult they are going through, we usually think, "well, i would do this, and things would be fine," but we aren't the other person. it happens alot with disagreements, too. we think to ourselves, "i would never do that to someone else." true, you wouldn't but they might. empathy is moving our "self" filter that we see life through aside, and trying to understand where the other person may be coming from. i admit, i am the worst person when it comes to putting my emotional response on hold, and trying to understand where the other person is coming from. did i grow up with them? did i have their parents? their family? did they have any issues along the way that may effect the way they deal with difficulties? my wife got exasperated with my male, "fix the problem" response to her issue, and told me to, "just listen". i'm better than i used to, but i still react in my male dna way. however, empathy is more than listening - it is taking a step or two to understand where someone is coming from. do you have a friend/family/co-worker that seems to be constantly involved in the same issue or situation. it seems like they are on a racetrack life path that takes them around and around through the same situation. to me, you have two ways to deal with it; 
Male: 100%, Male, i follow a lot about politics and i despise, yet appreciate the strategy behind the rhetoric. however, i don't know if i've ever been more disgusted by a blatant attempt to mislead followers into a false sense of appreciation than what metallica is now attempting to do on youtube. after having spent years suing any fan or distribution outlet they could find who mentioned their work online, they have now taken the obvious plunge into the realm of "if can't beat 'em, join 'em" with the hopes that fans won't realize their record. watch lars choke back his resentment of his publicist in the video below. seems genuine enough, don't you think? please, stop spending money supporting this band. they are the epitome of why the recording industry is missing the point and destroying itself by mistreating fans. they are now embracing tools they have fought against not because they believe in them or appreciate what they facilitate, but because they see the possibility of the revenue it will bring them. makes my skin crawl a bit. 
Female: 100%, Female, last night i was overjoyed to see that the snowpeas that i’ve been cultivating for about 4 months now are finally bearing fruit. like me, they’ve had to show a lot of determination in a place with so little arable land! boxed in next to my window in a little window-size container they are now happily producing. i can’t wait to taste them. to celebrate the occasion, i’ve asked two friends for dinner next week. i’ve already tried the lettuce i’ve been growing, and to be honest, it didn’t seem like anything special, but my friends pronounced it very “fresh!” it seems like things might be turning a corner for me as well. for most of this month i’ve been able to come home before the sky turned black, my email inbox has never gone over 101 unopened messages, i’ve finally gotten most of my address changes done and my christmas decorations are finally down! i’m hopeful that my growing understanding of school life and the reduction of my weekly hours will enable me to have something left to give or do after the day’s work is over. thank you, lord! 
Female: 99%, Female, i'm not exactly sure what to feel at this point. as a little girl you grow up believing your father is like superman and nothing can hurt him except for kryptonite. as you get older of course, that belief fades and you realize that he is human just like everyone else. but a part of you still wants to hold on to it. watching my father in that hospital bed made me truly understand how fragile life truly is..........i'm going to miss my daddy.........i hope he found a happier place to be.
Male: 73%, Male, this is purely an opportunity for me to stand up and admit i was wrong. a couple of seasons ago i would watch arsenal play and spend a good 80 minutes of the game going: 'we need to get rid of denilson, eboue and song they're absolutely awful. why can't wenger see that?!' now i only spend 20 minutes of the game complaining, and that's only when denilson's on the pitch. since song has been suspended we've looked decidedly dodgy in the middle of the park. yes of course that also has to do with the absence of fabregas (and to some degree ramsey), but song has grown over the last 2 seasons to become a talented rock of a midfielder and he has finally come into his own. he's taken on the role left by the ridiculous departure of flamini (who?) and we are a weaker unit without him. yes he has his shaky moments where you're left asking why he made a forward run leaving a gap at the back, or when he puts the ball out for a stoke throw when he could have passed it back to almunia. all in all though my faith has been restored in all things wenger. he is with the players day in day out on the training field and i am not. everybody was questioning his re-signing of sol campbell. it's now officially the best signing of a quiet january transfer window. without sol we probably would have lost at stoke.
Male: 100%, Male, in the fitness and nutrition field it's vital that you continue to educate so science doesn't pass you by. new research is reviewed and released almost every day that can have a lasting effect on your programming, so where do you go to keep up? i link to many of my favorite sources on the sidebar, but there are a few that haven't made it up yet. here's a short list of some that i've found educational: the fitcast : http://thefitcast.com/ i've been able to listen to snippets of their podcasts on my short drive to work, and the knowledge that kevin, leigh, dr. fass, and sometimes tony bring to the table is wonderful. weekly interviews with top industry professionals brings the listener several different views on varying topics. it's also great that, should i feel the need, i can just drop them a few questions to answer on the next episode. go ahead and subscribe to the podcast through itunes and see what it's all about. they each have their own blogs that i've found to be very informative. 
Female: 100%, Female, sometimes we wonder, 'what did i do to deserve this?' or 'why did god have to do this to me?' here is a wonderful explanation! a daughter is telling her mother how everything is going wrong, she's failing algebra, her boyfriend broke up with her and her best friend is moving away. meanwhile, her mother is baking a cake and asks her daughter if she would like a snack, and the daughter says, 'absolutely mom, i love your cake.' 'here, have some cooking oil,' her mother offers. 'yuck' says her daughter. 'how about a couple raw eggs?' 'gross, mom!' 'would you like some flour then? or maybe baking soda?' 'mom, those are all yucky!' to which the mother replies: 'yes , all those things seem bad all by themselves.. but when they are put together in the right way, they make a wonderfully delicious cake! ' god works the same way. many times we wonder why he would let us go through such bad and difficult times. but god knows that when he puts these things all in his order, they always work for good! we just have to trust him and, eventually, they will all make something wonderful! god is crazy about you. he sends you flowers every spring and a sunrise every morning. whenever you want to talk, he'll listen. he can live anywhere in the universe, and he chose your heart. i don't know who wrote this, it was sent to me and i wanted to share .. cute! i just wanted to remind you all that if you need prayer or just someone to talk to just send me a message! i'm here for you! alrighty tell me what you thought of this! tell me about your ingredients!! 
Female: 99%, Male, a few days ago i showed ronald and cale...two eight year olds that are rapidly becoming a pain in the ass...how to make tin can telephones. they come around often now wanting to know about more 'new' and 'neat' things. today they discovered my bomb shelter...yeah, i got a bomb shelter here; a real built in maybe the early fifties bomb shelter. underground over there to the north thirty-six steps away from the house; just a big concrete box in the ground with a steel door, concrete steps leading down, air pipes and such sticking out of the top. ronald and cale were tagging along behind me this afternoon and fate led me over that way. "what"s that?" hollered cale, staring down the shelter steps. if i had been hooked up to a lie detector, i'd have said the same thing: "that's where my vampire lives," i said. there is no electronic instrument on the market today that could have measured the speed with which two young set of eyebrows shot up at that news, and i swear the temperture dropped a few degrees from the cold chills running up and down a couple of small backs. my offer of letting them go down there and peep in at my vampire was flatly refused. ronald and cale are of the modern world; they know not to screw around with vampires. but if the cops show up here any time soon inquiring about vampires, i'm gonna know right off the bat who ratted me out. 
Male: 100%, Female, i recently received an email regarding being catholic and boycotting the latest instalment of the series that sent many a devout catholic seething into pits of rage (one of the 7 deadly sins, ironically). funny though, in a related link, the vatican doesn't seem to care too much. is this a case of a different kind of crucifixion in today's age of finding an identity? 
Female: 99%, Female, the person that shares my life and space on occasion, just happens to be named on deed and possession, as i am on theirs. a protection thing for both of us, assuring that the other will oversee all, if one of us cannot. we share the space of the abode, bedroom each (though somehow i got the small one without the walkin closet.) and we share the computer/office room and the other open spaces of the house. but, it seems i type too loud, and so the other must move office and their computer to another space, and i can keep the old. but, though the big bedroom is twice the size of mine, there seems not enough room for all the office equipment. so, additional space is claimed for that purpose, half the sunporch/entertainment room. the rational being, "it's half my house and you have your room, the computer room, the living room, the kitchen, and i need more space for meetings and connsultations, etc . ." . . .but . . .seems to me some of that "my" space is joint, enjoyed by both. i do not want the sunroom halved, for the purpose of providing more office space, when there was already room enough in the computer room. and, i do not type too loud . .not always. the sunroom is a many-windowed and sunny room with views in three directions, also giving access to the yard and pool. the best room in the house (not counting the other bedroom with walkin closet) i am impossible. i am selfish. it is not about me. i fear i shall soon be part owner of a duplex. 
Male: 100%, Male, most everyone around the world is prejudice in different ways, some more extreme than others; but no matter how extreme the prejudice is it will always have a negative effect. people have always had and will always have their differences, but we do not have to be so ignorant and discriminate against different ideas, races, sexual orientation, or religions;(even though most denominations cause discrimination themselves.)though i also don't agree with people slapping other people in the face with their life styles. whether it be a racist not treating one person as fairly as the other for obvious reasons of being a racist, or a very religious person telling you what their beliefs are for the consequences of your actions while trying to convince you that they are right about what they are telling you.
Male: 63%, Male, roger conway i have taught language, writing, literature and media studies from the ninth grade through graduate school. the greatest amount of my publishing has been online. i'm currently listed as associate prof. emeritus at southern connecticut state university. 
Female: 100%, Male, now i know why cats kill birds... current mood: unwanted i don’t know what it is about the birds but it seems like there's not enough room in their nest for me. not only that but in their eyes the old wise owl is losing her wisdom and had led a cat into their tree. that’s not the worst part though... mother hen speaks of me as the creature. she speaks to me of me and see's me as no more than a nucience. i feel so ashamed and poorly of myself for i do not want to disturb the nest. all i want is to find a home. not only a place to live, but a place i prefer to spend my free time instead of trying to find ways to stay out. a place where i am appreciated and loved for who i am, what i did, and what i am going to do. instead, i am swarmed by birds who claim that the cat is untidy and do nothing but stay around and eat. to me, their harsh continuous churpping hurts me more than a step on the tail. all i want is to forget the past and work for my future, but it seems even birds can’t do that... 
Female: 100%, Male, like i used to disgard people coming back complaining of pain after a hernia op, asking for lots of painkillers, until i had it done myself and geee, i started to appreciate the real pain; since then i always believed in people, apart from the occasionals who are blatently whingers. i have thought nothing of the nausea of mefloquine as an anti-malarial until ... about now. i have just taken one tablet 2 wks before flying away to kenya and already i am feeling.... soooo sick, not yet a vomit, but sick. im feeling the tablet blubbling up and burning in my stomach and i keep on burping. may be i shouldn't have taken it with an empty stomach. this concludes that the most caring doctor in town is one suffering from multiple problems him/herself; it doens't make the doctor the most capable, but certainly most empathetic. i am one. eeerrughhhhhh! *retches* oh thats my breakfast looking blended! 
Female: 100%, Male, come, stain my skin. splash the puke you waddle in on my bare back and burn its stench on the parchment with the glowing cigar with smell of steak, drawing smoldering pictures of broken chains and fucked up dreams burnt with jagged edges on the skin and when you burn out the cigar stub it out and flip me over and bite my nipple to suck up the red ink and write more, write bold with your tongue till i drag your head up and kiss you hard claiming the blood that is mine. back.
Female: 100%, Male, a couple of weeks ago, i was waiting at a traffic light, when a frantic woman came to my window saying she and her family had broken down on the highway; could i help? she needed money. i dipped into my pocket and found a $20 bill and handed it to her and moved on, leaving her behind. did she break down? i don't know. am i a wuss for giving her the cash? probably. but, something has happened to me over the past few years. i've learned from my failures that my successes are not that important, that it's important to stay in the mindset of failure, to be empathetic of those who are not as fortunate and to remember that success is often lucky. so, as i looked at this, i wasn't going to judge. i was going to help. 
Female: 54%, Male, i loved reading about vijendra singh - the boxer who became popular after winning an olympic medal this year. here is very good write up on his life done by indrani rajkhowa banerjee from times of india. here we go! a rugged village boy who rubs shoulders with the swish set and flirts with bipasha basu, olympiad boxer vijender singh is aware he is an outsider. he is proud of his rustic roots and fights prejudices with charming confidence and a quiet dignity. first things first. what do you look forward to when you set out to interview a hot-blooded jat boxer? you would expect him to look you over and size you up mentally or probably greet you with a few colourful expletives... especially when the guy is a 24-year-old basking in newfound glory. but this one is different. he throws a disarming smile as his eyes meet your eyes and stay right there! that’s vijender singh beniwal for you, india’s lone boxer to have won an olympic medal. 
Female: 66%, Male, i am becoming intense. it isn't a goal. i don't have a plan toward achieving intensity. it's an observation. i didn't start out this way. i was laid back and relaxed for what i think was most of my life. in fact, there was the time my golf coach encouraged me to develop a temper and some intensity. a sr. minister with whom i worked said i didn't take my mistakes seriously. a lot has changed. i've changed. i am becoming intense. so, i am looking for peace this coming week. i am intentionally seeking silence and peace. i will listen more and speak less. i will think before i react. i will be less intense. i will practice the divine hours. i will remember serenity. i will look to be more at peace. i make a promise to myself.i seem to march into quandaries. i don't think i do it consciously, but the result is the same as if i willfully looked for trouble. it worries me.tomorrow is the primary here in ky. it's irrelevant at this point it seems. the dnc has really messed this whole process up to the point to where a stalemate was bound to occur. still, i am going to the poll tomorrow and i will cast a ballot. i can't bring myself to believe that any vote is irrelevant in a nation that depends on participation.
Male: 100%, Male, so, by now, i would imagine that if you are reading this, you've probably heard that i am no longer in the kendalville-based metal band, forthcoming. well the rumors are true. i made the decision about a week ago to part from the guys, and get my life on track. there’s still some uncertainty in my head as to how i stand in the eyes of everyone else in the band. here is how i see the situation: i am a devout christian, and everything forthcoming stands for is based around christ, and i love that aspect of the band. second, i couldn't have asked for a greater group of guy to perform with for the year i was in the band. i learned a lot from all of them, and looked to all of them like family. being the youngest in the band by quite a few years, i got to pretty much experience having 3 older brothers that i didn't get to have growing up. joe, jeremy, and jake, no matter what, i'm always going to love you guys. i want you to know that. 
Female: 100%, Female, friends? i'm the chewing gum stuck to your sole. i'm the rain that soaks your trousers. i'm the crumbs in your bed. i'm the shoelace that breaks when you're in a hurry. i'm the rubbish you forgot to put in the bin. i'm the person who forgets to listen when you talk. i'm the glob of toothpaste on your newly-washed sweater. i'm the song you can't get out of your head. i'm the monotonous sound that wakes you up when you've taken the morning off. i'm the clothes you've become tired of. i'm the shoe that chafes your foot. i'm the food with too many calories. i'm the wind that wrecks your hairdo. i'm all the people who stare when you're feeling sad. i'm the headache the day after. i'm the telephone that rings when you've just fallen asleep. will you still be my friend? 
Female: 100%, Female, eugh. the past two days, ive seen you twice. you know what, it still kills me. i attempt to talk to you now, and its like nothing. it's like we've never met. i can't believe it all stilled happened. i can't believe i fell for you. what an idiot ay ? we used to be so close. you'd lend me your jacket, walk me home, make sure i gave you a hug and you ran after me when i was upset and we sat and talked for hours. you made me feel so amazing. a feeling ive never felt before. you knew my family, maaaaan didn't they fucking love you. you made sure i was always safe, you took care of me when we out that night in that club, even after what happened at that party. don't tell me you never felt anything for me, cus we both know that's a lie. i just can't believe after everything, our friendship means nothing to you anymore. i miss you. i need to get over you. in my own way i have. i've had to. i just can't believe you were to fucking scared to get it a chance. just remember, if you're ever reading this, you told me once, you couldnt lose anymore people in your life, i understood you, you used to try so hard to make sure we never lost contact. you'd even make the time in your "busy" life to see me after school, and we'd sit in subway chatting about your hard times :/ i can't believe it came to this, we were so close, still could've been, probably would have made my life so much fucking easier. but no, you took the coward's way out, becus you were "too scared" well from now on. i'm never letting you in my life again. you had your chance. i love you. end of. 
Female: 100%, Male, i'm getting older every day and i am trying to photograph as many of those days as possible. i am husband to 1, daddyo to 5, grand (poppy) to another 5 (so far). i use nikon cameras and lenses ... but i really believe that anyone can be a great photographer with any kind of camera. photography has been great therapy for me throughout my life. it has allowed me to get away on my own and with close friends to see the wonders of creation. i am trying to record something in photography that will live longer than myself. i think it would be really fantastic if my great-great grand-children could see the photos i capture and in effect "see through my eyes" but for a moment. thank you so much for your kind words of support and encouragement. i hope you enjoy what you see and are challenged in new ways to improve your own skills. all of your photos help me learn and improve in that same way. god bless you all.nikonsniper steve 
Female: 100%, Male, after weeks of planning the day is finally here. yesterday we hung the decorations and started getting everything ready. the party starts tonight at 7pm. you can grab some food at the grilled cheese truck which will be parked outside. inside japan la will be lots of mr toast products to check out, including a new black shaky bacon shirt which was printed up at the last minute by monkey in a dryer! next door to japan la is the mr toast party space, a whole empty store to hang out in. we will have a dj, free pabst blue ribbon beer and even mr toast hanging out so you can take you picture with him. it should be a fun, wonderful, silly event. 
Female: 100%, Female, ok, how many of you like to receive a nice letter in the mail from a friend? i know i do. even though most of the time i get the mail from the mailbox it is junk mail, i still enjoy the wonder of "will there be a letter?" on small occasions there is a letter that you open and savor. a nice card from a friend far away with actual hand written words, possibly in a colorful pen. you read it once, you read it twice, you may read it everyday for a week or longer. it inspires you to write one back and maybe even write a letter to a different friend. in this technological world we all email, face book, blog, etc..... and don't get me wrong i love them all, but what has happening to letter writing. we say we have no time, but really how many hours do we spend on the computer blogging or facebooking. so why has this art form lost its value? it has lost its value so much that post offices are closing. mail delivery may be shortened by a day. i had the wonderful opportunity to live on martha's vineyard for a period of my life . during that time i was an avid letter writer. nothing like living on a new england island in winter to motivate letter writing. there was this wonderful little store in vineyard haven, called paper tiger. it was filled with uniques cards, papers,pens, stamps and stationary sets. i would walk into town and peruse the store for hours picking out just the right cards for people and write letters. i think i will make someone happy this week and write them a letter and in the mean time support the postal service. just think what would happen if it closed. many books and history have been written and recorded through letters. let's keep our history going! happy writing.
Female: 100%, Female, i had all these ideas for blog posts about decorating my new house... err, i mean the house we want and are currently in escrow for. you see, this house is thirty years old and absolutely begging for cosmetic work, all in time of course ($$$!). however admist my day dreaming i realized that this house could very well not go through for lord knows what reason. and here i am, planning my life away like i always do. let's focus on the present, april. so ladies and gents, i present you with my new blog layout. i made about five other collages for the header that i may take a vote on, or ask the hubs since my friends on here are quite lacking. yes yes, i know i just renovated this place not too long ago, but i needed something to take my mind off of possibility. i am in control of this layout, you see, and it just feels right. thoughts? i am feeling irritated. perturbed. surrounded by crazy folks (family, patients) and people who want my money (tax time and despicable landlords). so this morning as a means to debrief i turned to a picture of my own version of walden pond, which led me to thoreau; walden and civil disobedience: 
Female: 100%, Female, now i think about the lives and trials of these women, and then my own. will there be a reward for me, here on this earth? i don't know. there may not be. but i can't live my sick life waiting for it. it's difficult, more difficult than many can imagine. having epilepsy, crohn's, depression, anxiety attacks [which are the worst things on the face of the earth], nightmares, and now back pain and some kind of cold virus. i'm literally *never* healthy. but i take comfort in the fact, the knowledge i am certain of, that one day, i will be completely healed of all my ailments. and i will see regina, and betsy, and little layla grace, and they will all be healthy too, celebrating god's greatness. i look forward to that day. until then, i wait. something i don't like doing, but maybe i'll do some good while i'm at it. it helps, to write my thoughts as i'm going through them. instead of thinking about it all beforehand, just starting and writing, continuing as i realize new things. so, really, this is more for me than anyone else...
Female: 100%, Female, shopping that is environmentally friendly and easy on the pocket?? why that would be a clothes swap party my friend! yes as the fashion society at uni we decided to host one this week. basically you brings some of your clothes that you no longer wear along and then swap them for somebodys else's castaways et voila you have new gear that didn't cost you a penny! you know what they say one man's rubbish is another's riches...(that is what they say, right?). well anyway it was very successful, i got myself a lovely new bag and jumper out of the deal. i would highly recommend you all try it. i also booked my flights to london with my girls yesterday! we are heading for a short break in the easter hols to treat ourselves to plenty of shopping, sight seeing and show stopping adventures. camden market is on my list of top 5 places in the entire world, so i am very excited to be going back! it's such a mesmerising place, so diverse and exciting. and they have the best doughnut stand i have ever seen. i'm tres excited!
Female: 100%, Male, i admit that i fall for girls pretty easily. and that has been the cause of many of my relationship downfalls. i think that many women believe that when i open up my feelings that strongly to them that such things aren’t sincere, that this is a product of loneliness. i can’t really blame them. i too have been skeptical of such things when directed at me. and a look at the myriad of different personalities of significant others of my past and i begin to even doubt my own sincerity. but i believe what it really is about me is that i have a tendency to look deeper into the person, to sympathize with their shortcomings, and to fall for the person that i know is in there. i feel that with an open-mind, i can grow to like or love anybody with time. maybe that's my inner counter-culture flower child speaking. it doesn’t help my situation though. i easily make friends and lovers but i can’t keep an intimate companion for the life of me. 
Female: 100%, Female, ok, so i know that the blog is supposed to be about psychology, but i have another passion, photography. and sometimes the tog in me has to come out and play. like one night last week, when cas came home from school demanding to go out, and gaz suggested we go for a walk. there's a resovoir not too far from us called entwhistle, which is really pretty. so we decided to go there. i grabbed my camera bag with a "i'll only kick myself if i see a shot and haven't got my camera" and off we went. i was soooooo glad i'd grabbed my camera when we got there! the sun was setting and the lake was partly frozen. the light was amazing, the colours were incredible. it was a very slow walk, with my boys sighing every time i lifted the camera again. but i think it was worth it! judge for yourself......
Male: 100%, Male, i have the idea in my head of what i want the completed piece to look like. however, as this is my first attempt at such an endeavor, it is, as might be expected, taking an inordinate amount of time. at this point though, i'm comfortable enough with my rate of progress to post up the original and declare that soon, the finalized or near-finalized version should be up as well. i hope you enjoy looking at my art, and if you'd like to see more of my abstract designs or rough sketches, please let me know! anything box i collect things that i think are neat or interesting, and i place them in an empty harmonica box in a drawer. recently i was talking to somebody who wanted to see them so i subsequently took this photograph of all the bits in there. i think it looks pretty neat. photobucket i will explain what all the items are starting from the top. the four steel towers at the top are tapered roller bearings from a wheel bearing of a truck. they're made of extremely hard steel which is one reason i kept them. as an experiment, i placed these four in alternate directions between two hard drive magnets. after several months, when i removed them, the atoms had been realigned and the bearings are now notably magnetized. 
Female: 95%, Female, how was everyone's weekend? well last week i did promise i would 'do' a post (is that proper blog-inology?) about my television work in australia and the us over the past 6 years, so here goes! at the ripe age of 20, fresh out of griffith university where i studied film and media (there you go simon cowell, i am well educated :), i landed my first major gig hosting a daily kids show on the nine network aust. called 'hot source'. this was my training ground for hosting, editing, segment producing, and script writing.my next major move was hosting the daily show 'studio disney' on the disney channel. i loved loved loved this job so much! i was lucky enough to travel around the world and australia, and work with the most amazing team. disney really taught me a lot about the international tv industry, and the work ethics and brand values they hold are second to none.
Female: 100%, Male, so yesterday was my first weekend shift. it was from 12pm-11pm, but i didn't show up until 3pm. lol, it had completely slipped my mind. i had woken up around 1pm and made breakfast and stuff. as i got out of the shower, i was like, "holy shit, i was supposed to be at work right now". needless to say, i got dressed and drove to work. i was assigned to a new trainer named lauren. i think she mentioned that she trained katherine, not entirely too sure on that. anyhoo, saturday was a pretty lax day comparatively. i had begun to practice documenting on a notepad and then entering in the computer system. i'm getting the hang of it, but there's still so much to learn about the whole thing. i met a lot of new people on saturday. i guess it was because that's when most people worked, considering they are around my age but a little older. 
Female: 93%, Female, hippocrates is known for the hippocratic oath that medical doctors are sworn by. hippocrates was the first known physician. his name is also where the word hypocrite originates from. i’m not sure how it correlates with medicine but i’ve come to know plenty of hypocrites. some believe being hypocritical is sometimes in others best interest. me? i disagree. if people ask questions they can’t handle the answer to..why ask? i’m a rather sensitive soul yet i can appreciate brute honesty any day...over simple hypocritical bullshit! don’t keep it real. keep it sincere...your reality may be askew from mine......
Female: 100%, Female, when i was younger, i loved stuffed animals. i had so many stuffed animals in my room and even more beanie babies. whenever i did get a new stuffed animal, i would always pick one out and then second guess my choice. i would worry about not "saving" the other animals from the store. i vividly remember being in a gift shop of a hotel and picking out a new stuffed animal. there were essentially two different choices. i could get the dog with the brown spots or the dog with the black spots. but it was so much more complicated than that with me. i chose the dog with the brown spots and then i wondered which of the brown-spotted dogs to choose. i closed my eyes quickly picked one up. when i opened my eyes, i looked at all the dogs still on display that i hadn't chosen. i promised myself that when i came back to the hotel, i'd "save" the rest of them. so you can only imagine my struggle in picking out a guinea pig to save at the pet store. the poor little furballs had probably never been touched since they'd arrived at pet co. and they're all in the clear plexi-glass boxes, which are horrible for them to begin with, with crappy bedding (litterally) and such little space to move. thank god we had to get a girl (since mike's sister has a girl guinea pig and we want them to play together without having to worry about little baby guinea pigs), or else the decision would have taken hours. there were four female guinea pigs available at pet co. the day we went in to get our guinea pig. there were two white ones which i quickly eliminated, sadly, completely based on the color of their skin. they had the red eyes and just didn't look like guinea pigs really. i felt so bad for them because they would probably not be adopted for a while.. maybe not ever. just thinking about them now is making me sad. i should have been less appearance-focused and maybe got one of them, but i didn't. it was incredibly hard to decide between the other two. i had liked the one's that fur looked like a calico cat's. mike liked the brown one with the white stripe. the guinea pig would be mine, but i wanted mike to love her too. it was all my decision and i was bringing her into our apartment and he promised he would help financially and with feeding and cleaning her cage. i knew i would love which ever guinea pig we chose. the calico one was especially cute because her nose was even spotted-- half was white and half was black. but the one with the white stripe was a lot more active. we had actually came to pet co. three times in the week and she was always awake and jumping around the cage. the calico one was always asleep. also, mike and i had decided on a name beforehand, pikachu, and the brown one looked more like a "pikachu" to me. so based on her personality, the name we chose and mike's previous opinion that he liked the brown one more, i chose the brown one. 
Female: 100%, Female, ow do you deal with grief? i found myself crying last night as i watched a tv show and one of the main characters painfully re-entered the same location where her daughter was suddenly taken from her. it reminded me of the night my puppy chucky was taken. now i know an animal can't really be compared to a human loss but my little puppy was my angel, my shadow and my baby. i still grieve over the loss and i still see the accident in my head on a regular basis. so this wont get me any fans but i am a self proclaimed high school bully, i am not ashamed of it because it is how i survived high school. i didn't bully every one i just picked on certain people and most of the time it was retaliation for shit they had already done to me. but since school has finished i left my bullying days behind me, i left every one alone. so my question tonight is how do you deal with people who you cant really get rid of? the current pain in my ass happens to be my boyfriends best friends partner so i cant really stomp on her and then scrape her off the bottom of my shoe. i want to know how you would deal with a person you cant quite get rid of... 
Female: 100%, Male, the honorable mention of the day was a girl who came in complaining about abdominal pains. the killer here is that she said she was mainly having cold symptoms like runny nose and congestion, but nonchalantly mentions the fact that she hasn't pooped in a week. she also said that was normal for her. o_o didn't poop for an entire week! wouldn't you be a little freaked out by that?! i just about lost it. i couldn't get over it...i still can't. i also think i had drank the most coffee in one day than i ever had in my life. it was three cups. it wasn't because i was tired or anything. caffeine has minimal effect of me. the coffee just tasted sooo good. in the physician's lounge, scribes are allowed to go in on the weekends because it's not as busy i guess. anyway, they have coffee machines that have these little one-cup packet thingies that you insert into the machine. i forget the brand name of them, but they taste amazing. that's pretty much i had to say about saturday i guess. it's harder to blog about it the day after, i suppose. anyhoo, until next time. 
Male: 100%, Male, first group of onions planted... sudarshan suryawanshi - ide india - drip irrigation expert - visited our farm yesterday... sudarshan said we are doing better with the ide drip irrigation systems than the two major agri universities in honduras... we held our first meeting of honduran campesino farmers at our center of operations... we are receiving reports of how there are those who hold top positions as agri directors for major honduran ngo´s... who do not want the ide systems at our farm... hah! you will not stop our work... i have said for years... the help must go directly to the organized honduran campesinos... most of the agricultural ngo´s in hondurans are dinosaur institutions... who only promote sustainable famine projects... 
Female: 100%, Male, six years later i lay at night and think about love and i have moved on to find happiness cause that's what she would have wanted. there is some one that i do love now, and would give her my heart. i know i'm not handsome or the man that i was 6 yrs ago with my looks. but my heart is big and kind. i would never be mean to her nor make her feel sad or down. i would give her the world and so much happiness if she would be mine. i know she's been hurt and afraid but with me i would protect her and be there every day. i lay awake and count the stars wondering why i've been alone for so long. i would give her my heart cause its who she is that i care so much about. for my heart beats for her. i just wonder if her heart will beat next to mine.
Female: 100%, Female, well for those that don't know i am taking 10 freshman kids from school to the grand canyon over spring break! yes i have lost my mind.... no i really am excited... i think! we leave early monday morning for the airport to fly to las vegas. then we fly out the red eye friday night! so yes i am spending my spring break with kids what am i thinking? i am sure it will be a vacation i will never forget! 
Male: 96%, Male, what can you say about a fertility doctor who detonated a twenty-ton hydrogen bomb? quite a bit, actually, and most of it good. juliet is one of the more accomplished characters in the lost universe, male or female, and a lot of what she did doesn’t seem to have any significant connection to her gender, unlike being a love interest (like kate), a mother (like claire), a dedicated wife (like sun), or a bullet-riddled corpse that men can shed tears over (like shannon, ana-lucia and libby). before i get into it, however, i’ll point out to anyone reading this series for the first time that i was inspired to look at how gender works on lost and whether the show’s female characters seem to suffer especially dreadful hardships in comparison to the men. i was motivated to consider this after reading and the a.v. club’s review of the “dr. linus” episode. the article suggested that women on the show do get screwed over, and i’m starting to think that it may be true. here are the previous posts that focused on lost’s ladies, with a quick summary of whether the character in question got put through the ringer:
Male: 100%, Male, as an undeniable wasp whose north american ancestry goes back to the colonial period, i usually keep my opinions of israel’s behavior to myself. such is my concern for the typical whiplash from many of my fellow citizens who remain ensconced in a sort of israel-right-or-wrong mindset. but in the current israeli issue before the us—israel’s continual building program’s encroachment on palestinian land—while we are sacrificing treasure and lives in the middle east and continue to suffer financial stress at home, i am unable to keep my mouth shut. israel’s recalcitrance mit gewalt, so to speak, is insane. 
Male: 93%, Male, falling awake between the vastness of time and space burning alive surrounded by boiling skin perpetual nosebleeds pouring blood out the rim mentally wiped out from the world's rat race. lingering in limbo between insomnia and hibernation from this place i need liberation for sleep is where i begin thought cultivation germination of motivation for my imagination. without sleep our minds are more open to be manufactured the elite lulling you into the facade of the rapture the brain stuck inside a cell, captured while our ability to learn the truth has been fractured. but i digress from this stress before creating a mess. if i could i would regress to words previously at my access. but as for now i'll express myself to excess. the living game of chess to which we obsess will diminish your finesse and halt life's progress. yes i transgress, to which i confess with true success. nevertheless, the human race is a damsel in distress held steady by the "freedom" of the press. once this is posted, i'm sure they'll already have my address.
Female: 100%, Male, i only have to be in a sunny beach side resort for a few days and i start to believe that i understand the local culture, respect the traditions and customs – 8 days into a holiday and i’m looking at property prices, wondering how i can give up the rat race to rent deck chairs out on the nearest beach – oblivious of course to any hidden social, political or environmental considerations that disappear under the protected and surreal atmosphere of sunbathing, swimming, restaurants on the beach, and wearing shorts and open toe sandals. so given this, i am normally very patient with this kind of conversation from ‘newbies’. after meeting your 10,000th person who knows all about the country you live in you adopt a skill i refer to as “hearing without listening”. so i was surprised when something really upset me during the conversation i was having with this particular women. i wont embarrass her or me in releasing her name, but this was the anchor lady from a uk tv news program, a very famous, well educated, well dressed, well travelled, porsche driving (that may give the game away to people who know her) alpha female – the type that would eat you alive, and leave most men in a jelly like state after her whip lashing tongue had finished destroying any male ego you had the audacity to possess. she was like a chinese moon cake (i will explain in a later blog) tempting and attractive on the outside, only to find a strong, spicy, and pungent filling on the inside.
Male: 100%, Female, i dont know why its taken me so long to realize most people don’t live with principles in their lives? i guess since i was raised to carry myself with some integrity...i figured others did the same. no good deed goes unpunished. this i learned the hard way. humans do not realize they are the very cause of their own demise. in this myriad of complexities we call the matrix or cyber world. people become lost. hiding behind their pc or phone screen. playing dress-up for their webcam or camphone. no real friends or relationships. nothing tangible. me? i like to be able to reach out n touch someone. whether it be to show love or put tips on em. old skool stilo. just know in my life..integrity exists. dignity is honored. principles matter. when i leave gods green earth i can take those with me. the matrix is all an illusion so doesn’t be mislead.
Female: 100%, Male, i am honored to be here today and to have the opportunity to share this time with you. when judge mordue asked me to speak, i was delighted to accept. this venue combines two of my favorite groups; students and veterans. i am a history teacher at cazenovia high school and truly believe helping and nurturing young scholars to be my reason for being. young people like you are near and dear to my heart. with regard to veterans, i happen to be one, but that is secondary. for me, veterans are the embodiment of our nation’s virtues. they are also living repositories of history. you’re probably tired of hearing your teachers tell you that we need to learn from history, so let me phrase it differently – we can and should learn from those who have made history. each year, i require my students to seek out and learn from veterans of our nation’s wars. how blessed you are to have veterans in your own family – i hope you will never stop learning from them. 
Female: 95%, Male, a word to the wise, if your look in for love and havint found it, the only advice i can give you lady’s and guys is maybe you are look in all the wrong places. maybe you need to just set back and enjoy life and they well come find you. trust me i have looked and looked and about the time i was about to give up and just set back and live life to the fullest she found me, i could be wrong but hey what’s life you can't have someone to enjoy it with right. keep your heads up and you well find that speacle someone!!!!
Female: 100%, Female, it started raining friday morning. and it rained. and then it rained. and then it really rained. in the wee early hours of saturday morning the wind became frenzied. an endless whistle punctuated by roaring gusts. the kind of wind that either mutes all other sounds or distorts them into something ominous. is that the trees moving? or is there an army of ninjas crawling on the roof? our backyard and the suburban crap sprawl beyond it inclines toward the house. not the smartest groundbreaking move but it’s really fine as long as you have a french drain around the foundation. we do not have a french drain. we do however have a lovely lakeside view. 
Female: 100%, Male, it's 2010, a whole new year full of possibilities has begun. for so many people, it's seen as a clean slate to mark a starting point. for others, a desperate hope for a terminus of a crap-filled past. for the rest, it's just a date on the calendar that reminds them to do something trivial yet important, like changing the batteries in their smoke detectors. for me, i suppose it's all three. first, i find the old soldiers, scattered around but within reach. in the glove box, in the travel case, in the overnight bag, in the dresser. it was time to say goodbye to my old pals, sad they couldn't see any action on the front lines, rotated out, having served their vigilant duty. it was time to bring in the new recruits. then off to the local recruitment office (aka abu's gas-n-sip) to find the replacements. i stood there surveying the troops at abu's. twisted pleasure, her pleasure, shared pleasure, intense ribbed... they've all had their time on the front lines. magnum xl? i knew there was a magnum, but an xl??? damn, i feel sorry for that guy. i finally settle on the 3-pack "ultra thin" variety. good, i could never feel anything with these before, maybe this version will make me feel like i'm actually a part of the process for once. only a 3-pack because i've thrown more away for being too old and unreliable than i've made use of in my life. plus, i was a bit jaded after tossing out 2 unopened family packs the day before. which really brings up the question: big boxes of twelve are called "family packs". isn't that a bit counter-intuitive, considering their intended function? maybe that's what my subconscious was thinking at the time i bought the last few boxes. if i get a family pack, i can make a family. huh. so anyway, i got the ultra-thin... not because it was ultra-thin (although that might be a bonus) but because it was the box with the furthest-off expiration date: 06-2014. maybe if the stars align just right, this box will be opened before then. oh, i bought a mega-millions lottery ticket too while i was at the gas-n-sip. i figured i'd have better chances with that than with my other purchase. come on, 32!!! win for me, sweetheart! 
Female: 100%, Male, life sucks! i hate it. not even a new camera makes it any better. i know now that my whole life has been a fucking waste. i have accomplished nothing. i'm an unemployed looser that has made nothing for himself. life is nothing more than a cruel joke. hiv sure is taking it's sweet time with me and i don't expect the fucking heart attack to kick in fast enough. only death will be the cure for this incurable infection. i am sure i lost a lot of friends over this and well, sorry to say but i honestly don't care. for most of you i'm just another coin in your collection and not one of the more valuable ones either. if you want to delete me, you go right ahead. the last fucking thing i need right now is someone telling me i got so much to fucking live for. i'm sorry but you don't know me that well, i would actually prefer that you did delete me if this blog is too much of a downer for you. there's nothing left to say....... 
Female: 98%, Male, every day or so i shall give insight upon what i brandon rogers am thinking. i will not as most state what i am doing or feeling but the thoughts and stories of my mind. all things may not be as they seem. i may stray from the truth and bring out my most creative muse to entertain you. if this however comes to be please be aware that i will eventually tell you.one hand shake is a simple greating. two is still okay if they are at the begining and end of a meeting of some sort. three is awkward but aceptable. my only issue is when people are so nervus that they keep shakeing your hand throught out the meeting or what not. i have no problem with shakeing someones hand but i have noticed something odd. most of my friends are female and most of there boy friends when they meet me they get nervous and so on to actualy shaking hands seven or eight times with me. are they looking for my approval? are they treating me like there only chance to get layed? just an odd thing in life that i noticed. ohh well. 
Female: 100%, Female, i'm sitting at my computer on this chilly autumn morning with a gentle breeze floating through my very open window. i can see tall trees and a families backyard and i hear men's voices as they walk around preparing to demolish the house located just behind mine. i hear trucks, cars and buses on the road, the occasional horn and birds singing their cares away and chattering among themselves. today i'm more expressing a thought then a questions, will the world really change so severely in the next couple of years that if i were doing this in ten years i wouldn't hear the noises or see the trees? well i know that by next week i wont see the trees, the block of land they are located on is being flattened so that contractors can build housing commission flats on it. the whether has gotten a lot chillier since autumn began a few weeks ago, i wrap a blanket around myself every time i leave my bed in the morning. i like the mornings that i look back at my bed after leaving it and i see my partner still laying there sleeping peacefully with his head now laying on the very same pillow mine just left. its lonely mornings like this one that i dislike. on days like this i wonder about my future, will i achieve all the goals i want to achieve, will i help, will i still be with him? then i casually shake my head and forget about them, its no use worrying over what is going to happen in a few years when you don't even know what might be happening that very day.... 
Male: 66%, Male, 1. avoid them, or 2. do the harder thing (which, in my opinion is always the best), and empathize with them and their issue. you can't change anyone, but i think if you empathize, that builds trust, and you could possibly have the opportunity to offer some steps to correct the looping path away from the issue. i'm not a professional counselor (i'm think you might not be either), but caring for someone and their issue can open up your heart and mind to offer caring advice from time to time. love and empathy can help you help others. all this is hard. life itself is hard, but sometimes the hardest lessons are the most rewarding. practice empathy. do your best to set aside the instant platitude, listen and be empathetic. the world is full of people going through difficult times, and if you take some times to start to practice empathy, you could have the opportunity to release the pain of one person, and that could have a positive ripple effect. i'll leave you with this. this has happened to me. sometimes the people that you help with empathy, can turn around and help you in a future time. we are not on this planet to be on our own, we need each other. have a great week. another little distraction coming next monday. tell a friend. :) 
Male: 63%, Male, every piece of advice a father can impart on his son can make all the difference in the world. sometimes it doesn’t even involve words… my father came from a family where the word “love” was scarcely shared. my dad was never the one for words. he always worked long hours or terrible shifts as a coal miner in west virginia when i was young. when the coal mines shutdown, we moved to florida where the cost of living was higher and the wages lower. my dad worked…that’s what he did. 
Female: 70%, Female, i am getting increasingly irritated by the minute. i wish people around me could get over their own inconsequential lives and stop bringing their negativity into the lives of others. i am beyond the point where i can offer empty consolation and sugar-coated words just to seem 'nice'. i am tired of people who sulk around all day thinking about their own humongous huge issues and 'problems' and spoil life for every body. just suck it in and continue to do what you have to do; that is where the strength lies, not in pretending defiance at the mere hint of another trying to make light the situation, which they probably are doing to make you feel better and realize how infinitesimal and pointless your gargantuan 'issues' are.
Male: 100%, Male, in his book in search of the ivory-billed woodpecker, jerome a. jackson relates that a fossil species was described as campephilus dalquesti by pierce brodkorb, an american ornithologist and paleontologist. this fossil species was discovered in scurry county in central texas, and dated to the late pliocene epoch. i wonder what c. dalquesti looked like. maybe a bit like this dino-bird!? at least the colors look right. the dino-bird portrayed below is anchiornis huxleyi - you can find more info here. check out this amazing video on finding dino color in fossil feathers. 
Female: 98%, Female, the weather's turned, and the old neighbors creep out from their crammed rooms to blink in the sun, as if surprised to find they've lived through another winter. though steam heat's left them pale and shrunken like old root vegetables, mr. and mrs. tozzi are already hard at work on their front-yard mini-sicily: a virgin mary birdbath, a thicket of roses, and the only outdoor aloes in manhattan. it's the old immigrant story, the beautiful babies grown up into foreigners. nothing's turned out the way they planned as sweethearts in the sinks of palermo. still, each waves a dirt-caked hand in geriatric fellowship with stanley, the former tattoo king of the merchant marine, turning the corner with his shaggy collie, who's hardly three but trots arthritically in sympathy. it's only the young who ask if life's worth living, notmrs. sansanowitz, who for the last hour has been inching her way down the sidewalk, lifting and placing her new aluminum walker as carefully as a spider testing its web. on days like these, i stand for a long time under the wild gnarled root of the ancient wisteria, dry twigs that in a week will manage a feeble shower of purple blossom, and i believe it: this is all there is, all history's brought us here to our only life to find, if anywhere, our hanging gardens and our street of gold: cracked stoops, geraniums, fire escapes, these old stragglers basking in their bit of sun. 
Female: 100%, Female, wow...has three years already passed?? neither of us can believe it. it seems like yesterday that we just met. it's unimaginable the love we share. regardless of our past and present we look on to the future as a family. i admit, we didn't know each other for too long until we just clicked. we saw each other's pain and mended it. we are each other's missing piece in the most uncomprehensible jigsaw puzzle fitting right into place. we've had our fights, but we learn from them and grow stronger. we have our special moments and grow stronger. we discuss everything and hide nothing and grow stronger. everyone tells him how lucky he is to have me at his side, but yet they don't understand that i am incredibly lucky to have him at my side. alex is the type of guy that every guy wishes they could be and that every girl would want. sure he has his downfalls, but if you don't accept them and help your love up, that is your downfall. we have shared our past to each other and our ex's, but together we laugh and say how far we've come to finally meet the right person to wake up to and enjoy life with. there is no better way to grow but through experience and communication with no restraints. no lies, no hidden messages. just straight forward truth and compassion. we are always supportive of each other through whatever endeavor. if we disagree, we discuss; and from that we understand each others points and come to conclusion. i'm not materialistic like his past relations and that's what he loves. i keep him happy as any woman should to his man. we are our own person and there is no better way to be expressed. i'm quite a goofy one so it always makes him smile. seeing him smile is such a joy it makes me smile. now we have sasha as well and she just helps us grow even more closer. his mother and i adore each other and confide in each other so dearly. we are the best of friends. our small family may be small, but in our hearts we are as big and robust as the night time sky if not more. three years have just gone by so fast.....we all await for what the future holds for us as our love grows stronger.
Female: 100%, Male, he cannot speak english, and makes no bones about it. can we talk in hindi?, he asks coolly as we settle down with meethi chai in an air-conditioned hostel room, which he shares with fellow boxers vijay and ram singh at patiala’s national sports institute. why stay in a hostel, now? “as a child i shared a room with my brother and five cousins. we were seven in a tiny room, and now we are just three!” uncluttered and uncomplicated. maybe, that’s what makes him a darling of the press. or is it his rakish, rugged charm? “don’t know. people say i am more popular than abhinav bindra. it’s destiny that i was born into a humble bus driver’s family. had i been pampered with trainers and dieticians, i wouldn’t be what i am today. i am an athlete of the soil, fed on a solid diet of bajre ki roti and bhains ka doodh . “ vijender’s roots are rock solid. his father still works for haryana roadways as a bus driver. “i’ve told him to take it easy, now that we have the money. but he says the day he stops working he’ll stop living. i remember when my father used to farm a small piece of land. i helped him by watering the crops. those were memorable days. tilling the soil with bare hands is joy in its purest form. i think that’s why farmers have a quiet dignity about them. “ this boy from a nondescript up village called kaluwas, along the meham-bhiwani road, hadn’t seen much of life or money till destiny catapulted him to overnight stardom. today, his days are full. he jet-sets to delhi and mumbai every week for photo ops, endorsement deals and p3 parties, where he rubs shoulders with bollywood stars and society babes. this six-feet-tall charmer has also walked the ramp for rohit bal. 
Female: 100%, Female, after college and getting settled in a new job i decided that it was time for a new chapter in life. so i moved into my very own place. yes 23 and just moving out. i knew this would be a very difficult move because i had never even stayed overnight away from home but maybe 3 times. boy was i right! so i called in for reinforcements. jodi and kristy to save the day. we all needed to get away for our own reasons so this was the perfect time. we would watch tom cruise movies and eat popcorn until we got sick. painting the house was a damn good time considering that none of us was 100% sure of what was going on. thank god for family. who knows what that place would have looked like. after the newest wore off and everybody got into something else, there i was all alone again. i still had family but i needed someone. so i had lost some weight and was feeling pretty good about myself so i called up jodi and told her we needed to get together. she had been through a divorce recently so she was ready.
Female: 100%, Female, i do not seem to be able to stay current with anything lately and blogging has been the worst. i am trying to keep up with assignments in my web design class, keep my lia sophia business afloat, which means calls and organization and keeping up with paper work, trying to keep my house clean and attempting to get some long overdue redecorating done. which brings me to this picture? remember when my son moved home for 6 months and we repainted his room in the color of his choice? well this room is now my office (with another cardboard creation homework assignment from sadie's art teacher stored here). it is bright! not in a good way. 
Male: 95%, Female, i don't want to admit how long it took me to figure out what these are called. as soon as i figured it out i said, "duh, i knew that." sea urchins, or echinoids (dead), in case you were wondering. i'm glad i saved some poor soul the time searching on google for "round, hollow sea creature", or "spherical sea creature" or "circular coral reef animal", because i certainly did not spend a lot of time doing the same thing, nope, not me. and now that i am done wasting time on the internet looking up round sea animals i will now go waste more time on the internet stalking people on facebook. this has been a public service announcement brought to you by a procrastinating graduate student that just wants to go home right now. have a nice day :) 
Female: 100%, Male, my name is ryan. i like snowboarding, hiking, hunting, fishing... well anything that is outdoors. i am pretty straight forward. if i am thinking something i am going to tell you. i joined the military back in march and currently doing job training for the next year. i love what my job is in the military. thats all i can say about that. if there is anything else you want to know about me just ask. who i'd like to meet: i have all the people in my life now that i want. i just wish i could be closer to all of them. 
Female: 100%, Female, then there was my life, which had fallen apart. all i was left with was the thought that i has tried, really tried and nothing in my life worked and my psychic pain was worse. god, i thought was either ignoring me or he just did not think i had prayed the right prayers, thought the right thoughts, gone to church enough, repented enough, suffered enough, believed enough, done enough, or was just not good enough. and i was very, very angry at him. after awhile i gave up and recently decided that i would try to fix me, to save me myself. then i gave up on god again. and it has been wonderful. my therapist is helping me find hope in, to accept, to connect with, to believe in, myself. i have reached points where i just want to crawl out of my hole and join a wonderful world. when i have those moments where i can't take 'it,' where my childhood demons overwhelm me and i want to get away, i retreat into my room, but i don't want to crawl in a hole anymore. i am open to the ideal that there is indeed something 'else.' something nurturing, kind, loving, in this universe but i am looking for that within myself. 
Female: 100%, Male, i truly miss "love". young love was a beautiful thing. it was the most comforting thing i have ever felt. i was never the relationship type of guy. i didn't even romantically or sexually care for females. but, after experiencing so-called, "love". i don't want to be without it. i do wish, that i had found love with someone smarter. someone who had a brighter thought pattern. and what upsets me the most is that i had worked hard. but, it all went to waste. and now, i have to rebuild it with someone new someday. i have no patience for that. i just want to skip to a time when i have it next. i don't want some gross ass bitch. i don't want some dumbass slutty-type little girl. i want a beautiful, intelligent, mellow, logical, selfless, understanding, ladie-like female. someone who doesn't involve herself with a grimey crowed. and does not use drugs or alcohol. someone, i can respect. who stays covered up. and makes logical decisions and considers most to all factors in a situation. someone who can appreciate all things and keep me happy as well as me keep her happy. i am afraid that i will never find that. i hate that i want to find love again. but, the truth is, love is a wonderful thing. i don't know what else to say. i'm sure that 'god' has someone in mind for me. and has had someone in mind for me in a while. the only problem i have is that i have become very impatient and depressed. time has become my enemy. and that is causing me issues. i have writer's block. goodbye for now. 
Female: 100%, Female, she loves to wear dresses while she plays trains and cars. she tromps through the mud in her pink tights. rarely leaves the house without a necklace or bracelet, but runs faster than the boys and hasn't met a jungle gym she can't conquer, even at 2 3/4. the day i snapped this shot with my phone, we spent quite a bit of time shoe shopping, just for fun. she loves red heels, just like i do. (i would have bought these, but they were too big for both of us.) we giggled and pranced in the isles of ross, trying on silly shoes we didn't need just because it was fun and they were really inexpensive, anyway. i am so proud of my little girl. she is her grandma judeen's granddaughter. i have no doubt that she, too, will be bailing hay in a miniskirt or stomping across the cow pasture without looking down, perfectly accessorized. 
Male: 90%, Male, i was at the public library last friday. i was working on a sermon. in a carrel across from me was a man with his back to me. i first noticed him because he was a loud typer. every keystroke echoed through the library. i couldn't have been the only to notice. i tried my best to keep my mind on what i was doing but every once in a while his fingers would whirl across the keyboard and the noise would echo out. so, i would look over at him and then i noticed; he was surfing myspace sites that had gay men in provocative poses and they were unclothed. to each his own. but, please, don't use a public computer for that! i suspect he was using the library computer because there would be no record of where he was or what he was looking at. had he been surfing those sites at work he likely would have been looking at some disciplinary action. but, i didn't need to see that. please don't use a public computer for that
Female: 100%, Female, i get so emotional and then i laugh, we humans are really something. i can enjoy reading debates on subjects that i have no opinion about but when it comes to subjects where i have choosen a point of view that is very deep in my heart i shun away and i can't continue reading. i do not want to comment. right now people are fighting for the right to home school in sweden, as some religious family made some bad choices based on their beliefs. there is an article about how children learn(link below) that i agree with. i wish i had the chance to live like this when i was young. i sometimes do not understand my own children´s choices to attend school and all the things (restrictions) that goes with that. freedom for me is so important but i will respect my children´s choices now as well as when they grow up. although every now and then (too often, elena says) i ask if she wants to quit school and i reminded her how nice it was before school. fyi elena started school when she was 9, and i am happy she waited that long at least. anyway i am getting lots of emails from the swedish homeschooling group about articles and ofcourse there is lots of comments on the subject. some are so uphauling that it is just amazing to me how we as humans can have such extreme opposite beliefs. but that is really okay. what turns my stomach is how people can judge and condemn others for their beliefs. well, i was just in the middle of it today and did not feel so good. i know it can be lonely to be a warrior (my favorite definition, from stuart wild, i mean different from mass consciousness) but it sure is worth it. 
Female: 100%, Female, the world is full of some beautiful souls, and it surely seems that olivier dupon from dossier37 is one of them. he is known to many sydneysiders for his gorgeous shop lola et moi, which he ran for about three years, and now the rest of the world is getting to know his quirky, colourful and inspired ways through his blog dossier37. olivier kindly shared these pics with daily imprint of his home in pyrmont. as he describes it, "great views, great light... we use the flat as a white blank canvas for our collections of antique and modern artworks and designer pieces."
Female: 99%, Female, born in brooklyn and now living in the not so wide open spaces of nj. i have a 35 year old son - yes i was a knocked up teen - he and his wife share a mother/daughter type home with me. i run my own business - used to have an office but now work out of home. i often work a second job to pay for internet service. i have 2 rescued cats.
Female: 100%, Female, i have become just a little bit wrapped up in this weight loss process and all the new things i am discovering about me, my habits around food, alternative forms of exercise, and life in general. i have shared all of my thoughts with you on this blog but i really don’t want this blog to be a weight loss blog. i started living the life of tere to be about my life, my family, my thoughts. me, me, me. weight loss is a part of my life but it is not the only part of me. but i had things i wanted to share with others about weight loss, things that have helped friends and others. i started to put off writing here about some funny things my kids did and other stories so i could post some weight loss stories. that’s not really where i wanted things to go. i decided i needed to compartmentalize my life a bit when it comes to sharing my life with others. so i did something that makes no sense with the small amount of time i have . . . i started a separate weight loss blog. one where i can share my thoughts on weight loss, food diary, successes and failures, low calorie recipes, tips and tricks from others, reviews of products, other people’s success stories . . . for those that are interested in that type of thing. 
Female: 100%, Female, we were friends along the way, sharing postcards, phone calls, fudge, pasta developed for diabetics, and videos of bill the dog. we figured out ways to get along regardless of our differences. you were part of my life for over two years and now you are gone. no more "yer" this and "yer" that. no more emails outside of myspace, that most others knew nothing about. i always appreciated your consideration for my feelings. when we first met, sometime in 2007 or 2008, you didn't think you would live until christmas of that year. but you did. count that as extra gravy. but i know it hasn't been easy extra time. with all my heart, i hope you just went to sleep the other night and never woke up. sleep well with peaceful dreams, sweetpea. we won't forget you. 
Male: 100%, Male, impurity is the only thing that is pure. the greater, richer and so called pure things are always vulnerable to impurity. but impurity in itself is the truest of the forms. look at the world. the corrupt hearts are so strong. least shaken and unchanged. so mighty powerful that the world used to be a better place once with only a handful of corrupt hearts. but those handful ones had the mighty power of impurity. they spread it like the plague. look around you. what yo ve is the invincible disease. so much so that the god's heart is touched by it and its a never failing touch. 
Female: 100%, Female, where i come from it’s…. a small island of the coast of north carolina called “cape hatteras island,” known for the tallest lighthouse in our nation. it’s also known for its beaches, white sands, surfing waves, and it’s treacherous diamond shoals. it has a very rich, full history in many areas of our past; wars, pirates, and tourism. many stories fill my head and my heart over flows with the memories i myself have on that little sandy beach i called home for most of my life. my family moved to cape hatteras when i was a very young girl, i believe i began the 3rd grade there on the island. we moved across the states from bremerton washington with my father’s job in the us navy. of course moving to the island at that time brought great change in my life and back then it truly was just a little island, full of mom and pop shops and restaurants, little tourism, and 1 full military base. as a child our days were spent; playing with the neighboring children, playing in the park, or making a trip over the dunes to play at the beach. in many ways it was ideal yet in today’s society by many standards it would be considered lacking on so many levels. 
Female: 89%, Female, the other day i was so lucky as to be able to spend time at one of my favorite places. it's a place i hope to spend the vast majority of my summer. (second to work, i suppose, but let's not think about that now) shortly after arriving, i ran into a friend and inquired as to his well being. he replied, "oh, perfect! if i won the lottery, it'd be a step down!" i love it. i feel the same way, surrounded by such awesome people in my life. 
Female: 100%, Female, hospital waiting rooms have wi-fi now. isn't that great? and it's noisy in here. i didn't expect that. we are swapping stories about my mil who has not been married to my fil for years. mil travels with food. half-eaten food. want some coffee cake? i couldn't leave it behind, it was so good. that kind of thing. my sil is here in dayton from madison, wi. other sil, from chicago, will come in later this week, tag team hospital visits. the plan, medico-wise, is to remove a goodly portion of fils left lung, and follow up with chemotherapy. because he actually has a chance to survive this thing, fil has quit smoking. so far, anyway. his wife is working on it. sil from madison will be taking regular smoke-breaks during the day. we are working on our explorations of the kitchen-infested, extended-stay hotels in the south dayton area. last night's was not as nice as the last one we stayed in, but it was fifty bucks cheaper for the night. so there's that. and i am never one to pass up a free breakfast. the back pain is subsiding, which is good. i am being very careful with it, to maintain. thanks to everyone for all your good wishes, both for me and for husband's dad. if the waiting gets long or boring, i'll hop on and write some more, and i'll post any updates we hear. for now i'll post because i am a total comment whore. shut up. no wait. don't shut up. i mean shut up about me being a comment whore. i think i've had too much coffee this morning. 
Male: 100%, Male, so when it comes to war, i'm not sure how to define my stance. overall, i'm a pacifist and think war is always wrong. new rule: mankind never gets to say it is divinely created, enlightened or intelligent while blowing the shit of another country. but... i know fighting can be inevitable. even the tao te ching refers to defending oneself and, let me tell you, i embrace this philosophy as wholeheartedly as i do my pacifism. you take a swing at me buster, you best prepare for some knuckle sammies. not very christ-like i suppose but a) i'm not a christian and b) modern christians rarely follow this admonition anyway. now, some will argue that war and defending oneself is much the same thing. they see war as a good thing, a thing to be practiced often. peace is not an option; only killing and bloodshed. they revel in this power. these sorts of humans brag of "military might" and having "the best trained, finest army in the world" just as napoleon did or caesar before him. they lust for fighting and dominance, dominance over the whole earth. does it truly make a difference if these mad men are americans and not germans? since when is killing and destruction a virtue to anyone but the fabled denizens of hell itself? war is a poisonous goo filling their hearts and thoughts with taking a hill or planning bombing raids never mind the collateral damage. that's what i just don't get or put my head around. how can one delight in the slaughter of war? but it is so. i see it daily. there are millions of my fellow americans who see war as glorious and divinely sanctioned and are proud to send our soldiers into death, cheering along like roman cheering gladiators into the colloseum arena. war is not sport but it has been transformed into one in these modern times where we can watch the participants play on youtube or cnn. it's like a live action video game except when our soldiers die they don't get to hit the reset button and try the level again. 
Female: 100%, Female, how do you deal with grief? i found myself crying last night as i watched a tv show and one of the main characters painfully re-entered the same location where her daughter was suddenly taken from her. it reminded me of the night my puppy chucky was taken. now i know an animal can't really be compared to a human loss but my little puppy was my angel, my shadow and my baby. i still grieve over the loss and i still see the accident in my head on a regular basis. so this wont get me any fans but i am a self proclaimed high school bully, i am not ashamed of it because it is how i survived high school. i didn't bully every one i just picked on certain people and most of the time it was retaliation for shit they had already done to me. but since school has finished i left my bullying days behind me, i left every one alone. so my question tonight is how do you deal with people who you cant really get rid of? the current pain in my ass happens to be my boyfriends best friends partner so i cant really stomp on her and then scrape her off the bottom of my shoe.
Female: 100%, Female, there are many things in life that make me happy. little things, things that just make me smile. one of my favorites is post secret sundays. post secret is a project started a few years ago by a man named frank. frank left a few postcards in a few public places with simple instructions. write a secret on it, decorate it if you like, and send it in, anonymously, to the address already written on the card. it grew into quite a phenomena. now, frank gets postcards from all over the world. he's compiled them and published more than one book. and every sunday, frank posts a new set of secrets on postsecret.com. even with the books and the website, only a fraction of the secrets are viewed. every sunday, i log on to my computer, excited to see the new secrets. it's a simple pleasure that i truly enjoy. the secrets are often sad, sometimes disturbing, occasionally funny, but always insightful. everyone has secrets. little secrets, like you really don't like your friend's new haircut. unimportant secrets, like it was you who ate all the blueberries(an actual secret that made me laugh out loud). and big, important secrets, ones you don't even dare think about for fear of inexplicably blurting out loud simply from the weight of it.
Female: 100%, Female, woke up around 11 am and realised that i most likely was dying. the horror...! the horror...! it should be said that i deal with illness like a man, an over-dramatic man. so i phoned my doctor, seeing as i'm stockholm-bound for friday and didn't feel like suffering from intense ear-ache on my flight. managed to eat an apple. one apple a day does not keep the doctor away. walking to the doctors it was hard not to feel giddy though (in spite of my case of the death). it was so sunny and warm, flowers everywhere and i could really feel how this was it. winter is well and truly over! bumped in to my friend nat, out for some fresh air with a friend. nat was equally ill, and her friend had tonsillitis. poor us. walking back home from the doctors i spotted this book in the childrens bookshop in bruntsfield. i had to stop and buy it for my own (not so) hugless douglas. you can see part of his hairy leg in the picture above. the likeness with a fussy bear is striking. my new bedding was delivered! ooooh, all white, crisp and new! sat on it with doris the ukulele for a while, feeling all summery and happy.
Female: 100%, Female, that one day, the world will change, and people will start realizing how beautiful life really is. i pray that one day the world will be rid of liars, cheaters, and thieves. &if not rid of, than those people will see that their actions actually do affect others. i pray that their eyes will be opened, and they will start to feel the way that god feels toward his children. i pray for the rid of ignorance and foolishness. i pray for the rid of selfishness. i pray that god's hands will protect the hearts of the ones who live for him, and pity those who never believed. i pray that god will bless those in need of strength and courage. i pray no punishment. but i do pray for the people who need to get what they deserve. i pray that people who don't care, will start to. and people who do care get what they need out of everything. life isn't about wanting things for yourself. it's about loving those who you easily provide for. materials are nothing without the feeling of loving what you have. the thankful feeling you receive when blessed by things that you love. i pray that anger will be lifted off of my shoulders. i pray that god will give me the strength to lift my head up and walk with positive energy. i pray that god will give me the strength to forgive those who i feel i cannot forgive, and help those to forgive me for the wrongs i've caused upon them. &i pray, that one day god will help me believe that this is all worth it, and happiness is really obtainable. 
Female: 100%, Female, today was one of those i should really get up and do something, but i don't wanna kind of days! so i didn't! i hung out with my wonderful husband and sweet kids. poor hunter came home from his sleepover really sick. as soon as he walked in our front door i knew he was sick! then i felt him and i he said "mom, i feel terrible." he broke my heart. he is running a fever and has a bad cough. if i don't see an improvement in him by tomorrow, i'm going to take him to the er. hunter is so thin and frail as it is because he isn't the best eater, so we kind of panic when he gets sick at all. anyway, other then hunter being sick, our weekend is lazy and good! i like it when mark is off work and the kids are home from school and we can all just be together. our weekdays are so crazy and busy, so the weekends are a time to be together. everyone is gathered around the t.v. right now watching america's most wanted. okay, i know not the best family show, but we all love cops and america's most wanted and we never miss it on saturday night. 
Female: 100%, Female, alex is now 3.5 months old and doing great. he has found his hands and they are normally in his mouth. he is great at assisted standing and sitting. he has all kinds of sounds. goo, hoo, oooh and ahhh. bouncing in the bath is his favorite activity. his friends elliott (zoe's brother) and maude (max's sister) were born at the end of november. so they are only a couple of months be hind him. max had his second birthday right after christmas. we got to see him open on present. nathan helped with the rest. alex loves to be held when awake. as soon as he is sleeping he wants to be put down in a quiet place. as far as sleep he does ok. currently he is sleeping from 9pm-1am and then up again at 4 and 6 or 7. this would be fine with me but nathan has been getting up at 3. make for a long morning.
Female: 100%, Female, ok so you know how when you to anywhere they want to know what you're allergic to? well my answer was always nothing. but now i have an answer. anything in the factive family. it took two trips to the hospital and alot of itching to figure it out. i have a few pictures in the "people you know abulm" for you to see but man it's a you had to of been there kind of thing. but with the great nurse i have helping me with my oatmeal baths and slathering down of the old sticky lotion i'll make it through just fine. man you got to love a good nurse! 2-9-08 you know i'm still not sure that i was having a reaction. i have had sooo many kids with the same rash at school. poor kids! 
Male: 99%, Male, so i'm in the corner tavern the other day, listening to these two enlightened, albeit, not very educated, idiots debating the need for a national health-care program. why is it that every booze hound is an expert on political issues? i go to the bar to drink, not talk, and certainly not to debate current affairs!!! i think from now on, i'll just stay home and drink in the privacy of my own home. i really hate people, especially idiots and morons.......and pretty much everyone else!!!!!!!!!!! assholes!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Female: 100%, Male, i’m still writing with my lucky pen. it’s been broken in half for a long time now but the ink still makes words. the words sometimes cheer or bring despair; sometimes the rant gets caught in my facial hair. there're holes in my boots and there's holes in my life but that just lets out the shit. i’ve yet to see a wise man stand in my shoes, and see the light of day from my point of view, but perhaps i’m just not wise or i’ve soap in my eyes. i try to keep away from the things i despise but they just follow my feet like i was so much fresh shit and they’re so many flies.
Female: 100%, Male, hello, nikonsniper followers. well, my trip to the los angeles area is coming to a conclusion. that's right, dear ... i'm coming home! one of the things i do for comfort when i am alone and away from my family for great lengths of time is to listen to sermons online. i know, i can almost hear you shouting "boring"! ok, ok, some of you are about to quit nikonsniper for good! you've heard enough. i have just proved to you that i am completely looney! well, some of you know i was a bit of a creative kid. i was a.d.d. before being a.d.d. was cool! so i was, ... let's say, a bit of a handfull. for those of you who are new, here's a little background to give you an idea of what kind of rodeo clown i was when i was a kid. anyway, i tell you this so you don't go around thinking i have my head in the clouds with no clue of the real world. anyway. i was raised in a christian home. more than that, ... my father was the pastor of a large church that we attended (sometimes in handcuffs). oh, please don't cast me as some kind of religious fanatic. in fact, truth is ... i don't believe in religion whatsoever. i believe in a person and yes i know him. and that god-man is jesus. anyway, ... i don't want to scare you off ... because i do completely respect your views. here's what i wanted to say. i find that as i age (get more older and more wrinkled-er) i appreciate nature more. if you would have told me when i was 30 that i would enjoy photographing butterflies one day ... well, i woulda told you that you were a complete ding-dong (probably not those words though). i so often feel at peace when i am sitting on a bench watching god's wonders. like seeing wild deer up close just staring at you, giving you a close look, like they were sent to you. well, i recently watched a sermon about the christian in nature that i enjoyed called, "is god green?" you can hit the link and watch it if you like. it's good! it is by one of my favorite speakers named john ortberg from menlo park presbyterian church in menlo park, ca. he won't bore you! go on, give it a listen ... i dare ya ... it's a risk free way to tell your mom that you went to church. pastor ortberg speaks on how we are to respect the world of the creator.
Female: 100%, Female, i love the biggest loser and believe it can truly motivate people to get help when they can’t figure out how to help themselves but the contestants get bigger and their stories sadder each season. all fat people are not sad. some of us have dated and been loved and really like ourselves but want to live healthy, active lives so we change our bad habits and work hard to get rid of the weight we so blindly allowed to take over. but people need to realize that being skinny is a lot like winning the lottery. it’s great and some things are easier but all your emotional issues are still there until you do something about them. maybe self-confidence really was my problem. i was ok, my life was ok. i was happy. so i never did anything about the weight that kept creeping on. i have done something about it several times over the last few years but really only half-heartedly, because i felt like i should. but i am doing it this time and i am very serious about it. 
Male: 100%, Female, i just love and cherish the place where i was born because i am a friend, cousin, niece and granddaughter of people who reside in israel. i also happen to love the scenery, food, and environment of my homeland. fine, so i lied a bit. i would hate to see israel non-existent or unrecognized. which definitely means i am not anti-israel. i'm also pro-peace. glad we got that out of the way... a little history on how i got into this whole pro-israel mess: i was born in rishon le-tzion, israel. i lived there until i was eight, except for a brief year when my parents decided to venture off to hong kong and get all these stamps on my passport from all of eastern asia. too bad all i have is the passport... i moved to the silicon valley where i only started to value and recognize my israeli identity in high school. i got really involved in a youth group called tzofim, and dreamed of joining the israel defense forces after high school as early as freshman year. i spent every summer vacation in israel during my high school years. summers were all i looked forward to. did i mention the silicon valley has a huge israeli community? well this was a huge factor for my ability to stay connected to my culture instead of diving into the big melting pot of american society. well as it turns out, there aren't many israelis in san diego, where i go to school. thus, when looking to get involved with the israeli community at ucsd, i was right away pointed to the direction of israel advocacy. this is where this whole pro/anti thing comes in. israel advocacy is basically feeding everyone and their mom the greatness of israel through it's diversity, innovations, and did i mention- it is the only democracy in the middle east? it's making sure jews are pro-israel and non-jews are simply not anti. sometimes, i feel as if it one big brainwash. but i live for it. so. i'm going to israel this summer simply to enjoy every beautiful (and humid) moment. 
Female: 100%, Male, today i shot two portraits. both left me frustrated, both were my own fault. i just couldn't get them to go right, i was taking too long then the people started getting impatient, in turn the impatience with myself grew and i am left with a handful of "missing it" photos and none that really get the job done. i have been exchanging emails with a student over the past few days regarding portraiture; and after today i feel a bit like a hypocrite. i shot this photo of the cricket a few days ago and the entire shoot lasted about 7 seconds. i didn't really pose her, just told her to freeze while i grabbed my camera. there is a magic in some portraits that no matter how hard you try you just can't extract in other situations. what worked two days ago with little to no effort couldn't be replicated even with exponentially more time today. weird.
Female: 100%, Female, i am at the beach on spring break. not my spring break but my daughter's. several months ago, daughter and her friends decided they were going to the beach for spring break. they planned, they analyzed, they researched then realized that they needed someone older to rent a place and it was going to take a lot more money than they thought. so they invited the moms. don't get me wrong . . . i don't feel used. how many 20 year olds would even consider taking their moms along with them on spring break? we are actually quite honored. and we are having fun. 
Female: 98%, Female, what if you could have forty million dollars completely tax free... but you could never spend more than two days in the same city. this means that you'd have to move all your stuff every two days. you could rotate cities, but you'd have to put three cities in between every rotation. so if you wanted to go back to whatever city you're from you would have to make sure you stayed six days at three other cities before going back. would you take the money and resign yourself to the life of a nomad or would you stay put and live where you wanted for however long you wanted? i don't know what i’d do. if i took the money i’d definitely invest in an rv. i don't know if i could do that forever though. not having to work ever would be nice, but i may want to stay somewhere sometimes. what would you do? 
Female: 100%, Female, i am a sucker for a liberty print. i still have several items, including a paisley bag, which i bought from the store when i used to live in london. so it's no surprise that i like these pretty - in a old-fashioned yet contemporary way - baby clothes from elki. it was started by sisters emma and georgina who grew up in a creative home. emma went on to study visual communication and become a graphic designer while georgina studied fashion. emma lives in central west nsw while georgie is based in bowral. the sisters import the fabric from liberty of london and design and make the products themselves.
Female: 100%, Female, i love the atmosphere the olympics are stirring up in my city. i love how i can get downtown after a 20 minute bus ride and experience granville street at its best. the colours, smells, sounds and feelings of patriotism breathes vancouver new life. nightlife is more expensive, but hey, it's a great time to be barely legal. with the exception of day one (and today), our city has been enjoying some of the best weather it's seen in february. things haven't been perfect though. with the tragic death of the georgian luger on day 1, the untimely death of canadian figure skater joannie rochette's mother, unseasonal, warm weather, the disappointment of some canadian medal hopefuls...and not to mention the failure to bring the fourth pillar up for the opening ceremonies (lol, fail) we've been good sports. we're handling it well. the enthusiasm for the games is contagious. 
Male: 100%, Male, monetary values change as consciousness changes. prosperity consciousness is higher consciousness because it is an expansion of the projection of the individual mind unto infinity and that is the reason why yogi bhajan taught us for the first ten years about meditation and yoga to help us heal ourselves, physically and mentally and then he started teaching us prosperity consciousness because it becomes more obviously important for one to become prosperous materially as one progresses spiritually. yogi bhajan was such a master that he was able to teach us the importance of this. if you look at any other spiritual discipline, you may or may not find this. as spritually aware people who are also conscious of our physical health we must balance all aspects of life. that is what yoga means to find the balance in all things. 
Female: 100%, Male, …and as the rain fell brilliantly against my window on a saturday afternoon i noticed a pattern within the glitter of the rain drops. the pattern was of a face that i recognized as life and we stared at each other. we wanted to see who would be the first to blink and neither of us wanted to be the first one to give in. what i noticed in life’s eyes were my many sacrifices as i have had to hurdle the jump ropes of reality in order to live dreams without having to close my eyes. and in this life, my life, i have suffered to be able to smile; i have cried to be able to enjoy my fate. acceptance is our greatest sacrifice i’ve come to learn because until we accept our challenges we aren’t able to come up with a game plan to reach our goals or to stimulate our own identity.
Male: 99%, Male, that's the second book in timothy zahn's trilogy. i bet y'all thought that i'd forgotten about you concerning our fun trips. i realize that it's been a while since our vacation, but i might as well post the pictures that i was planning. the delay has been caused by our village missions conference and my presence here at zachary and brenda's house. hopefully i'll be able to post some pictures of this fun soonish, but until then, without further ado, the unveiling of our seaworld pictures. i'm a big fan of the orcas. they are much more majestic than their cousins: regulation orcs. i was pretty sure, beforehand, that whaling was illegal in most states these days, but i certainly enjoyed my portion. there's a likelihood that i was a bigger fan of the belugas than of anything else. for whatever reason, the all-white whales (or the all-black pilot whales which i have no pictures of) just greatly entertain me. perchance my monochromatic preferences reflect my worldview? here's a good pic of emily and her grandma looking at said whales. 
Female: 71%, Female, "weird" let's discuss what this word means to us. to me it's one of the most positive words i know. i think i generally use it to replace "interesting" but after trying to convince a guy the other night that me calling him "weird" was a massive compliment, i realized i might be alone in this. i am completely attracted to things and people that are curiously bizarre. things i don't quite understand but that none the less, peak my interest. i think most people i know feel the same way but whenever i use the word with a big smile on my face, i get the oddest looks. i also tend to take it as a compliment when i'm called "weird", even though i'm sure it's often not meant that way :) google image "weird" and this is the first thing that comes up. see how great it is? 
Male: 100%, Male, there are two types of fall guys; one who willingly accepts responsibility for something he didn't do, to cover for those that did. and then, there's the other, who gets blame for it, because the one who actually did it, doesn't want to be held responsible for it. either way, someone at the end is left holding the bag while the bad guy gets away. truth of the matter is, fall guys can be found in all walks of life. in the corporate world, in the politics of washington, in the world of espionage, love triangles and even mostly in the world of organized crime. sometimes fall guys are not just about one, but about many. that’s because in this so-called fault game, the notion becomes many and the more the many, the more confusing. the more confusing, the more difficult it becomes to find the truth. who to blame and who to be held accounted for. we live in a world of good versus evil. the fall guy is made out to be evil. when reality tell us that evil doesn't really exist. because good prevails all and evil is simply a lack of. evil becomes our creation. and in the end, its really all about us. since we are to blame for its existence. so in the end there is and always will be a fall guy. when the finger is pointed at who? it should always be pointed at us. 
Female: 100%, Female, i like...flipping my blankets over to the cold side when i sleep, the smell of sun-dried laundry, back scratches, food, the winter's first snowfall, beach days, wallowing in music on a gloomy, wet vancouver day, crazy moments with people that i am crazy for, nail polish, avocados, big warm hugs, large meadows that are frolick-a-ble, the summertime, qoola, french, leggings, tea, metal water bottles, school supply shopping, salmon cream cheese, and some days more than others - stepping out of my comfort zone.
Female: 100%, Male, alone for so long walking down the path of darkness with a lamp to guide my journey of life, the fates gust by the light goes out and i stand alone in the darkness wondering why.i continue to walk down the path not seeing anything but shadows and figures that speak of evil of man. i pray and hope for an angel to walk with me as a guide and friend, soon in the midst of the darkness a glow begins, a path is laid before me showing me a place to call home. as i walk down this path i come upon a woman with a bright smile that let's my heart know all will be good. at first she was a stranger who offered nothing but kindness and love. my angel shares her heart and pain with me as we walk beside each other on this path. i never knew of such kindness and love, a mother’s love i never known the scars and fears that led to the dark path i took. slowly the angel became my best friend and mother. thankful for the blessings and kindness she gave to me. through are pains together she has loved and stood by me, its fate that the woman who lost her son found one and the son who never had a mother found his. the path is brighter and easier now that my mother angel is with me .i has found peace in my life through the love and friendship of another who was hurt and lost likes i. my mother angel is my guardian, my keeper, my mother and best friend. i thank god for the blessings i have in this path i take. my biggest blessing is the mother i've found to me that's the greatest gift of all. 
Female: 100%, Female, it's been more than a month since i posted anything here. there is so much to do, plus my mood has been off. but i am finding myself really missing the journaling aspect of blogging, especially therapeutic journaling. blogger, heal thyself! i have a week's (unpaid) vacation from my job, and today i am cleaning house as i work on my to-do list. sewing, decorating, and gardening are how i would most like to spend this time. more moving-in and organizing have to be on the plan as well. some priorities are (bleh!) taxes and fencing (*sigh*) to keep the boy dogs from fighting. dunno why, but i did not expect this!! harley is not the simple laid-back, big squishy teddy bear he appears to be, and has now decided to make his move for dominance. or is it his intention to completely eliminate the competition? i can't tell. as he grew much larger than frankie, he began to show a little more aggression in regard to being close to his people and being first for treats. less than a week after his neutering, we had an incident over a collar and leash they both wanted (to them, these evidently mean being singled out for special treatment) and ended up with a badly wounded frankie, and also a wounded mama (me). poking your finger into a fighting st. bernard's mouth is not the best idea for breaking his hold. four days later my fingers on the other hand were also injured and frankie's wounds were opened, and i learned that this was not something we were going to be able to put behind us for a long time, if ever. one of the happiest parts of my daily life has been sharing it with my three dogs, so you can imagine how bummed i am feeling. at all times, one of them must be either outside, in the laundry room, or in the crate. coordinating their quality time inside and out is very unsatisfying for all and very time-consuming for me. we did find a really good article on this type of aggression, which has given us some hope, and our next plan is to install a good gate in the middle of the house and to create a separation of yards outside. otherwise, we will have to find harley a new home where he can be the only dog, without competition for affection and attention. damn. 
Male: 97%, Male, it was a scavenger style race with checkpoints throughout boston and the surrounding neighborhoods. at each checkpoint you would be given a task to perform "find 5 pounds of stuff, carry it to the finish," "find 10 pounds of stuff," "find something that cant fit into this envelope" etc etc. the idea was that by the end of the race we and our bikes would be covered in random objects and whoever had the most interesting stuff and the most stuff by the end of the race would win a prize. in the end, i finished the race 7/52 racers in about 3 hours with 40lbs of crap on me--which turned out to be good but not nearly enough to beat the eventual winner, joshua, with an amazing 100lbs of junk hauled in on his cargo bike. the race was followed with a bbq and bike games, all in all a very fun time that i hope to repeat again in a few weeks at the next race! 
Female: 100%, Female, finally! i got a full day's work done. almost 4k, and if my hand hadn't started hurting i would have gotten even more done. there's nothing i hate more than wanting to go go go and my body won't let me. grr. but i'm finally past the three-quarter mark on hecate's own and i'm about to write the big showdown, save-the-day scene, after which there will be food, sex, and more food, knowing zach. once that's done, it's time for the meat grinder and the beta readers while i switch gears and begin serious work on norwegian wood. i keep thinking i'm missing something, though. something important. hopefully it will come out in the meat grinder and i'll slap myself silly, fix it and move on. if not, my betas will find it, slap me silly, and i'll fix it and move on. i haven't gotten the artwork yet on mating games, and i'm still waiting for word on noble blood, but i knew i would be. laurie was swamped with red hot fairy tale submissions, so for everyone who's waiting to hear the fate of duncan, jaden and moira hopefully i'll have word no later than the end of april. oh! and if you've emailed me and i haven't responded, please email me again! i've been so caught up i may have missed it. our oldest graduates grade school this year, we're planning a trip to disney and i've got rt coming up, so when i'm able to sit at the computer i've been concentrating a lot on that stuff since writing wasn't much of an option the last few weeks. i know. bad author. no cookie for me. p.s. samhain publishing is hosting the second annual sammie awards at the samhain cafe this sunday! i'll be there if i have to sit dusty down and make him type for me! hope to see you there! 
Male: 100%, Male, at the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. ~jean houston when people are laughing, they're generally not killing each other. ~alan alda i am creating this blog in pursuit to put more laughter in the world. not only will i post my own original parodies, but i will also introduce you to other parody creators. i will introduce you to parodies in all forms—songs, video clips, stories, and books. stick around and i promise you’ll get a good laugh. mostly, i will be posting parodies that i made up in this blog. from time to time, i may review other parodies, parody writers, videos making fun of others, etc. before i post a parody, i will first explain how the parody came to me. often, it takes some time to explain, but it’s sometimes interesting to hear how my imagination works. also, i know that if you have to explain the meanings of “jokes” and what not, that means that they aren’t funny. but there will be sometimes that i will want to explain certain parts of my parodies; a phrase, a verse or two.
Male: 100%, Male, i like birds, especially woodpeckers and most especially the huge campephilus woodpeckers. four years ago i started a photo group on flickr called ivory-billed woodpeckers and others in the campephilus genus by posting a few photos that i took of a pale-billed woodpecker in belize. the illustrious ivory-billed woodpecker is a member of the genus. there are many others too, with far smaller claims to fame, with words like cream-backed, crimson-crested, magellanic, powerful, and robust in names that suit their unique brilliance. our group recently surpassed 1,000 photos contributed by many individuals - a real milestone! now this site becomes another way to celebrate these birds. 
Female: 100%, Female, oh friends, it's finally here! i thought the month between christmas break and midwinter break wouldn't be too slow and awful. i told myself i wouldn't take any days off, and i succeeded in that. there was a pretty rough stretch for a bit, though, with that bunch of teachers leaving. loud leo left our class a few weeks ago. a new boy came to the class, but has apparently left again. buster, whom i have not yet mentioned, has remained a serious detriment to the class's focus and my patience (or lack thereof). buster refuses to control himself most of the time. it's 'just' his mouth, but that means that when the rest of the class is quiet, he makes noise and distracts them and then never shuts up. and then other boys follow his lead and make more noise. gah. he's really started to haunt me. we had a party on friday, that i'm not totally certain they deserved, but lord knows it had to be better than trying to force them to learn on the friday afternoon before a week off. our last lesson of the day was writing valentine acrostics. about half of kids basically did nothing, but the rest did a poem, and a few of them turned out pretty well actually. anyway....we're here! vacation! a whole week off! my favorite part is always the not waking up before dawn. also the not being at school for so many hours. i didn't bring anything home with me, but i will go in for a few hours next week to work on unit planning. i've been behind for so long but too exhausted to do anything about it. i hope to remedy that, at least a little for now. also, happy valentine's day today! the boy and i had a wonderful day together, out and about.
